### [1] [Anomaly in canonical semiclassical gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07753)
*Viqar Husain,Irfan Javed*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the standard version of the semiclassical Einstein equation is inconsistent because replacing matter terms in constraints with quantum expectation values leads to a non-closed constraint algebra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify inconsistencies in the canonical semiclassical Einstein equation formulation.

Method: Analyzing the closure of the constraint algebra after substituting quantum expectation values into matter terms.

Result: The constraint algebra does not close, proving the formulation's inconsistency.

Conclusion: The canonical semiclassical Einstein equation approach requires modification to address the identified algebraic inconsistency.

Abstract: We show that the canonical formulation of the semiclassical Einstein equation, where the matter terms in the constraints are replaced by expectation values of the corresponding operators in quantum states, is inconsistent due to the non-closure of the resulting constraint algebra.

Abstract: While the effects of solar mass change can be neglected in studies of solar periapsis shifts-given the relevant timescales and magnitude of change-the influence of a black hole's dynamic and chaotic mass variation on the Periapsis Shift of test particles in its surrounding spacetime demands a detailed and meticulous investigation. Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes.

### [3] [Detecting Parity-Violating Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Pulsar Polarization Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07956)
*Qiuyue Liang,Kimihiro Nomura,Hidetoshi Omiya*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores using pulsar polarimetry to detect circular polarization in stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, which could probe parity violation. By cross-correlating timing and polarimetry data, the method isolates circular polarization signals with Hellings-Downs patterns, offering sensitivity comparable to current astrometric methods with future telescopes like SKA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pulsar timing arrays can't detect parity-violating GW components, so the study uses pulsar polarimetry to measure circular polarization, which indicates parity violation. Recent advances in polarization arrays motivated this approach.

Method: Derived electromagnetic wave polarization rotation via geometric optics in GW backgrounds. Analyzed cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals to isolate circular polarization, noting shared Hellings-Downs angular patterns.

Result: Cross-correlation method successfully isolates circular polarization signals. Future facilities like SKA could achieve sensitivities to GW circular polarization matching current astrometric techniques.

Conclusion: Polarimetry combined with timing data provides a promising pathway to detect parity-violating GW features. SKA and similar instruments will be critical for reaching required sensitivities.

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays probe isotropic stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds in the nanohertz band but are insensitive to its parity-violating component. Motivated by recent progress in pulsar polarization arrays, we study the response of pulsar polarimetry to GWs and evaluate its potential to detect circular polarization in isotropic stochastic GW backgrounds, which characterizes parity violation. Based on geometric optics, we derive the rotation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves induced by propagation through a GW background. We show that the cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals isolates the circular polarization component from the GW intensity, sharing the same Hellings-Downs angular pattern. With future facilities such as the SKA, timing-polarimetry correlations could reach sensitivities to the circular polarization of GWs comparable to those of the current astrometric methods.

### [4] [Solar-system experimental constraints on nonlocal gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07981)
*Yunlong Liu,Yongbin Du*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study investigates the Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity model by analyzing four Solar-System experiments to constrain its parameters (ζ,b). The experiments include light deflection, Shapiro delay, perihelion advance, and geodetic precession. Results show that higher b reduces nonlocal effects, weakening ζ constraints. Perihelion advance gives strongest bounds near b≈1.06, while Shapiro delay dominates elsewhere. Combined data defines a tight parameter space region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity model against precise Solar-System experiments, determining how parameters ζ and b affect observable gravitational effects and constrain the theory's viability.

Method: Derive observable geometric quantities from geodesic equations in a static/spherically symmetric spacetime. Compare these with experimental data from VLBI/VLBA, Cassini, MESSENGER, GP-B/LLR. Analyze parameter constraints using light deflection, Shapiro delay, perihelion advance, and geodetic precession data.

Result: Larger b values suppress nonlocal effects more at larger radii, reducing constraints on ζ. Perihelion advance provides tightest bounds near b=1.06; Shapiro delay dominates otherwise. All four experiments together produce a well-defined allowed (ζ,b) region.

Conclusion: The combined analysis of multiple experiments is essential for robustly constraining nonlocal gravity models. The Deser-Woodard model is tightly restricted within a specific parameter space, highlighting the importance of b in mediating ζ's observational impact.

Abstract: In this work, we study the constraints on the characteristic parameters $(ζ,b)$ of the Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity model in a static and spherically symmetric background, using four classes of high-precision Solar-System experiments: stellar light deflection, Shapiro time delay, perihelion advance, and geodetic precession. From geodesic equations, we derive observable geometric quantities that can be directly compared with VLBI/VLBA astrometry, the Cassini time-delay measurement, MESSENGER data and the GP-B/LLR results. Our results show that a larger value of $b$ suppresses the nonlocal effect more rapidly with radius, thereby weakening the overall constraints on $ζ$. The perihelion advance exhibits the strongest sensitivity to $ζ$ around $b\simeq 1.06$, providing the tightest single experiment bound, whereas away from this region the combined constraint becomes dominated by the Shapiro time delay. Incorporating all four experiments yields a well-defined and sharply bounded allowed region for the parameter space $(ζ,b)$.

### [5] [Gravitational-wave dispersion over inhomogeneous space-times: General relativity, screened theories of gravity and non-minimal dark energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08023)
*Nicola Menadeo,Serena Giardino,Miguel Zumalacárregui*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores how lens-induced dispersion (LID) of gravitational waves (GWs) in modified gravity theories allows testing non-minimal theories. It finds detectable phase shifts in GR for spherical matter, enhanced dispersion in symmetron gravity, and potential GW reflection by bodies like Earth under certain parameters. This opens new observational avenues to study modified gravity beyond the ΛCDM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize gravitational waves as probes of modified gravity theories by analyzing lens-induced dispersion effects, which provide a unique window into testing cosmological models beyond Einstein's general relativity, especially in light of challenges to the ΛCDM paradigm.

Method: The authors compute GW dispersion in GR for spherical distributions, extend analysis to scalar-tensor theories (symmetron gravity) to evaluate parameter spaces, and assess effects like wave blocking by astrophysical bodies. They use theoretical calculations and parameter space exploration.

Result: GR shows detectable LID in next-gen detectors; symmetron gravity exhibits enhanced GW dispersion over GR and Brans-Dicke theory. Earth could act as a GW reflector in unexplored symmetron parameters, blocking ~50% of events or altering signals significantly.

Conclusion: GW dispersion offers a novel observational pathway to test modified gravity theories, particularly screening mechanisms in dynamical dark energy scenarios. Prior gravitational lensing methods are insufficient to explore these effects, making this a promising avenue for future GW observations.

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are direct probes of cosmological gravity, sensitive to space-time inhomogeneities along their propagation. The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\sim 50\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $Λ$CDM paradigm.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The forthcoming space-based gravitational-wave observatory Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should enable the detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object gradually inspirals into a supermassive black hole while emitting gravitational waves. Modeling the waveforms of such systems is a challenging task, requiring precise computation of energy and angular momentum fluxes as well as proper treatment of orbital resonances, during which two fundamental orbital frequencies become commensurate. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of fluxes derived from three approaches: the quadrupole formula, post-Newtonian approximations, and time-domain solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We show that quadrupole-based fluxes remain in good agreement with Teukolsky results across a broad range of orbital configurations, including perturbed orbits. Building on these insights, we explore the dynamical impact of resonance crossings within the adiabatic approximation. By introducing novel numerical methods, we reduce computational costs and uncover diverse resonance-crossing behaviors. These results contribute to the effort to understand theoretically and model adequately resonance crossings during an EMRI.

### [7] [Directional Quantum Singularities in Curzon Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08190)
*M. Mangut,O. Gurtug,M. Halilsoy*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The scalar quantum probe method is applied to the Curzon solution, showing that the uncharged Curzon's strong singularity at r=0 becomes regular quantum mechanically, while charged versions remain singular due to additional off-center singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Curzon solution's directional singularity provides a unique case to test how quantum effects regularize classical spacetime singularities.

Method: The Horowitz-Marolf scalar quantum probe method is applied to both uncharged and charged (electric, magnetic, dyonic) Curzon spacetimes to analyze singularity regularization.

Result: The uncharged Curzon singularity at r=0 is quantum-regularized, but charged variants retain singularities due to an additional off-r=0 singularity affecting quantum analysis.

Conclusion: Directional singularities may be resolved quantum mechanically only when no secondary singularities exist, highlighting the role of multipole charges in maintaining classical singularities.

Abstract: The scalar quantum probe method developed by Horowitz and Marolf is applied to the cylindrically symmetric Curzon solution. The main cause for choosing the Curzon solution is that it is the best known example that exhibits directional singularity. Interestingly the singularity at $r=0$, for the uncharged Curzon spacetime, which is classically very strong with a divergence rate of the order $\frac{1}{r^{10}}$ becomes regular when examined using scalar quantum field. The charged Curzon spacetime, however, due to the emergence of a second singularity off the $r=0$ singularity does not regularize quantum mechanically. All three different charged versions, i.e. electric, magnetic and dyonic share the same feature.

### [8] [Constraining modified theories of gravity through the detection of one extremely large mass-ratio inspiral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08221)
*Hui-Min Fan,Alejandro Torres-Orjuela,Verónica Vázquez-Aceves,Tian-Xiao Wang,Tai-Fu Feng*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores using gravitational waves from extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs) to test the Chern-Simons theory of gravity. They find that XMRIs, involving brown dwarfs spiraling into a central massive black hole, can constrain the Chern-Simons parameter ζ with bounds of 10^{-3} to 10^{-6} for low- and high-eccentricity orbits respectively, while recovering most parameters with high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of XMRIs via gravitational wave observations from future space-based detectors (LISA, TianQin, Taiji) offers a novel avenue to probe strong-field gravity and constrain alternative theories like Chern-Simons gravity, improving our understanding of fundamental physics and galactic center physics.

Method: The study employs a time-frequency MCMC method to analyze GW signals from XMRIs, simulating both low and high eccentricity orbits to assess parameter estimation capabilities. They specifically examined how deviations from general relativity in the Chern-Simons framework affect observable GW signatures.

Result: For low-eccentricity XMRIs, ζ constraints reach ≈10^{-3}; high-eccentricity cases achieve tighter bounds (≈10^{-6}). Most intrinsic parameters were recovered within 1σ, with precision at 0.1% except for brown dwarf mass (10%) and ζ (log-scale precision Δlog₁₀ζ=0.08 for high-eccentricity and 1.27 for low).

Conclusion: XMRIs are powerful tools for testing Chern-Simons gravity, with eccentric orbits providing tighter constraints on ζ. These results highlight the potential of future space-based GW detectors to validate general relativity and explore alternative theories in the strong-field regime.

Abstract: Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), formed by brown dwarfs inspiraling into a massive black hole, emit gravitational waves (GWs) that fall within the detection band of future space-borne detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Their detection will measure the astrophysical properties of the MBH in the center of our galaxy (SgrA$^\ast$) with unprecedented accuracy and provide a unique probe of gravity in the strong field regime. Here, we estimate the benefit of using the GWs from XMRIs to constrain the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that XMRI signals radiated from the late stages of the evolution are particularly sensitive to differences between Chern-Simons theory and general relativity. For low-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the Chern-Simons parameter $ζ$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-3}$. For high-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the parameter $ζ$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, using the time-frequency MCMC method, we obtain the posterior distribution of XMRIs in the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that almost all the parameters can be recovered within $1σ$ confidence interval. For most of the intrinsic parameters, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-3}$. For the brown dwarf mass, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-1}$, while for $ζ$, the estimation accuracy reaches $Δ\log_{10}ζ=0.08$ for high eccentricity sources and 1.27 for low eccentricity sources.

Abstract: We employ the Poincaré section, fast Lyapunov indicator, recurrence analysis, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction to investigate the dynamical behaviors of the motion of particles around a new dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe presented in [A. Di Pinto, S. Klemm, and A. Viganò, J. High Energy Phys. {\bf 06}, 150 (2025)]. We note that the swirling parameter $j$ and magnetic field strength $B$ make the equations of motion for particles nonseparable, and confirm the presence of chaotic behavior in the motion in this dyonic Kerr-Newman-Melvin-swirling spacetime and its sub-cases by removing the conical singularities and removing both the conical singularities and the Dirac strings. We observe that both the number of chaotic orbits and the chaotic region increase with the increase of the parameters $j$ and $B$, but decrease as the electric charge $Q$, magnetic charge $H$ or spin parameter $a$ increases. Moreover, we find that the presence of $j$ changes the ranges of $B$, $Q$, $H$ and $a$ where the chaotic motion appears for particles. The swirling parameter together with the magnetic field strength, electric charge, magnetic charge and spin parameter yields richer physics in the motion of particles for the spacetime of a dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We test dark-energy-motivated screening mechanisms with near-Earth space-based measurements. Within a post-Newtonian treatment, we compute leading corrections to three observables, namely geodetic precession (Gravity Probe B), pericenter advance of LAGEOS-2, and Sagnac time delay in a prospective orbital configuration. We then map these corrections to bounds on chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton models. LAGEOS-2 data yield the strongest Earth-orbit limits for symmetron and dilaton models, while a prospective Sagnac setup provides the tightest constraint for chameleons. These results highlight the relevance of low-density, space-based experiments as sensitive probes of screened dark energy and exclude previously allowed regions of parameter space.

### [11] [Tests of General Relativity with Einstein Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07520)
*Andrea Begnoni,Walter Del Pozzo,Matteo Pegorin,Joachim Pomper,Angelo Ricciardone*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper forecasts the accuracy of testing General Relativity using third-generation gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET), showing potential for constraints on post-Newtonian coefficients at orders of 10^-7 for dipole terms and 10^-3 for higher terms with 10^4 events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational challenges in Bayesian analyses for the high detection rates of third-generation detectors, and to quantify how well ET can test General Relativity's predictions through inspiral post-Newtonian coefficients.

Method: Uses a Fisher matrix approach to simulate parameter estimation for large populations of binary black hole mergers, combined with Bayesian hierarchical analysis to jointly analyze events across ET configurations.

Result: ET could achieve constraints of ~10^-7 on dipole radiation terms and ~10^-3 on higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients with 10,000 detections, across both triangular and L-shaped detector designs. The study also estimates the number of events needed to detect deviations from General Relativity at different PN orders.

Conclusion: Third-generation detectors like ET will significantly improve tests of General Relativity, with their performance dependent on detector design and event population size, necessitating large catalogs for high-precision constraints.

Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences offer a powerful and reliable probe of General Relativity. To date, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has provided stringent consistency tests of General Relativity predictions. In this work, we present forecasts for the accuracy with which General Relativity can be tested using third-generation ground-based interferometers, focusing on Einstein Telescope (ET) and binary black hole mergers. Given the expected high detection rate, performing full Bayesian analyses for each event becomes computationally challenging. To overcome this, we adopt a Fisher matrix approach, simulating parameter estimation in an idealized observation scenario, which allows us to study large populations of compact binary coalescences with feasible computational efforts. Within this framework, we investigate the constraints that ET, in its different configurations, can impose on inspiral post-Newtonian coefficients, by jointly analyzing events using a Bayesian hierarchical methodology. Our results indicate that ET could in principle achieve an accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ on the dipole radiation term and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ on higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients, for both the triangular and the two L-shaped designs, with $10^4$ catalog events. We also assess the number of detections required to confidently identify deviations from General Relativity at various post-Newtonian orders and for different detector configurations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study gravitational wave emission from periodic orbits of a test particle around a noncommutative-inspired black hole surrounded by quintessence. Using the zoom-whirl taxonomy, which is characterized by three topological numbers $(z, w, v)$, we classify these orbits and calculate several representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits. We find that the noncommutative parameter $Θ$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $Θ$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector. Moreover, the presence of the quintessence field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors. These results suggest that future space-based gravitational wave missions could probe or constrain noncommutative effects in strong gravitational fields.

### [13] [Nonlinear Gravitational Wave Memory : Universal Low-Frequency Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08514)
*Caner Ünal,Doğa Veske*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates nonlinear memory effects in gravitational waves, calculating their contributions to stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWB) from various cosmological and astrophysical sources. It proposes a method to probe the universe's thermal state using the memory spectrum's slope and evaluates detection prospects for future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover a universal infrared contribution to gravitational wave backgrounds from nonlinear memory effects, which are present in any gravitational-wave environment. Understanding these effects allows for a complete frequency spectrum analysis of SGWB and provides a novel way to study the universe's thermal history via the memory signal's properties.

Method: The authors calculate the stochastic nonlinear memory signals arising from diverse cosmological (scalar-induced, reheating, phase transitions, topological defects, turbulence) and astrophysical (binary mergers of black holes of various masses) sources. They derive the full SGWB spectrum incorporating both linear and nonlinear memory contributions and analyze how the memory spectrum's slope relates to the universe's equation of state.

Result: The study reveals that nonlinear memory contributes a universal infrared component to all gravitational-wave backgrounds. It establishes a framework to determine the thermal state of the early universe through the slope of the memory spectrum and identifies potential detection scenarios across different frequency bands with upcoming experiments.

Conclusion: Nonlinear memory effects are fundamental to understanding gravitational wave backgrounds' infrared regimes. Future experiments targeting specific frequency ranges could exploit these effects to probe cosmological parameters and validate theories about the universe's high-energy thermal evolution.

Abstract: A universal contribution exists in the infrared (low frequency) regime of all gravitational waves, which results from nonlinear memory. Nonlinear memory is sourced by linear order gravitational waves and exists for any gravitational-wave background. We calculate the stochastic nonlinear memory signal of various stochastic backgrounds of cosmological (scalar induced, reheating, phase transition, topological defect, turbulence) and astrophysical (binary mergers of stellar-mass, intermediate mass, supermassive, and primordial black holes) origins. These results allow us to derive the complete frequency spectrum of cosmological and astrophysical SGWB. We calculate how to probe the thermal state of the universe, i.e. the equation of the state, via the memory spectrum's slope and also discuss the detection prospects at various frequency bands with future experiments.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes in scalar-tensor theories, focusing on their matter content and stability under radial perturbations in Einstein-Maxwell gravity with a conformal scalar field. It finds stable configurations are achievable with appropriate parameter choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the feasibility and stability of thin-shell wormholes in extended gravity theories, specifically scalar-tensor frameworks, to understand their existence and physical viability under realistic conditions.

Method: The method involves constructing spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes in scalar-tensor theories, analyzing matter requirements, and applying stability analysis under radial perturbations. Two Einstein-Maxwell-conformal scalar models are tested.

Result: Stable static wormhole configurations are possible in both studied scenarios when parameters are appropriately selected.

Conclusion: Scalar-tensor theories allow stable wormhole solutions under specific parameter conditions, contributing to theoretical models of traversable wormholes in modified gravity contexts.

Abstract: In this article, we construct a family of spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes within scalar-tensor theories of gravity. In the case of wormholes symmetric across the throat, we study the matter content and analyze the stability of the static configurations under radial perturbations. We apply the formalism to two particular examples involving Einstein-Maxwell gravity coupled to a conformal scalar field. In both scenarios, we show that stable configurations are possible for suitable values of the parameters involved.

Abstract: Direct electromagnetic observation of the orbital motion of a sub-parsec, supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would provide the first conclusive proof of such systems existing. Widely considered to be the sources of gravitational waves, binaries are expected to form as a natural consequence of galactic mergers and determining the processes that drive their evolution is essential for understanding cosmological evolution. In this work, we evaluate the prospects of using ground and spaceborne Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to observe supermassive black hole binaries and estimate their orbital parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is considered as the primary case study. Achieving unprecedented resolution, BHEX will provide access to a new volume of binary parameter space, potentially enabling the first, confident detection of an SMBHB. A binary toy model using a post-Newtonian orbit propagation is developed and simulated observations by BHEX and a ground array of telescopes are performed. An orbit fitting approach using Bayesian dynamic nested sampling is presented and its efficacy is demonstrated on the simulated observational data for a set of example binary systems. It is found that for BHEX, binary detection requires a total flux density of 0.04 Jy with a minimum separation of ~2 microarcseconds and an observable mass ratio dependent on the total flux. With three annual observations, BHEX could constrain semi-major axis and eccentricity of binaries with orbital periods <10 years to within 13% of the true values. A curved trajectory could confidently be detected in binaries with period <23 years. Proposals for how candidate sources could be identified in time for the BHEX mission are also provided. Finally, we constrain the requirements of a future spaceborne VLBI system, capable of performing a statistically significant survey of supermassive black hole binaries.

Abstract: To validate key technologies for wide field-of-view (FOV) X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat series has been developed as a prototype platform for the Low-Energy Xray Polarization Detector (LPD) onboard the POLAR-2 mission. The wide-FOV design significantly increases the complexity of the background environment, posing notable challenges for real-time gamma-ray burst (GRB) identification. In this work, we propose an in-orbit GRB identification method based on machine learning, using simulated spectral data as input. A training dataset was constructed using a Geant4-based simulator, incorporating in-orbit background and GRB events modeled within the 2-10 keV energy range. To meet the computational constraints of onboard processing, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM), which is fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based on miniCPM-V2.6 and quantized to 4-bit precision. The model achieves perfect classification accuracy on validation data and demonstrates strong regression performance in estimating GRB spectral indices, with an RMSE of 0.118. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of onboard deployment through a simulated satellite data processing pipeline, highlighting the potential of our approach to enable future real-time GRB detection and spectral analysis in orbit.

Abstract: Spaceborne gravitational wave observatories, exemplified by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, are designed to remove laser noise and clock noise from interferometric phase measurements in postprocessing. The planned observatories will utilize electro-optic modulators (EOMs) to encode the onboard clock timing onto the beam phase. Recent research has demonstrated the advantage of introducing an optical frequency comb (OFC) in the metrology system with the modified framework of time-delay interferometry (TDI): the removal of the EOM and the simultaneous suppression of the stochastic jitter of the laser and the clock in the observation band. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach with the OFC-based metrology system. We report that after proper treatment, it is possible to use the measured carrier-carrier heterodyne frequencies to monitor the time derivative of the pseudoranges, which represent the physical light travel time and the clock difference. This approach does not require changing the existing TDI framework, as previous OFC based efforts did. We also present the experimental demonstration of our scheme using two separate systems to model two spacecraft. Using this novel approach, we synchronize the two independent phase measurement systems with an accuracy better than 0.47 ns, while the stochastic jitter in the observation band is suppressed down to the setup sensitivity around the LISA performance levels at 15 pm/sqrt(Hz).

Abstract: We investigate the potential of leptonic meson decays $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$, where $M$ is a pseudo-scalar meson, as a probe of neutrino portal dark matter. The model of our focus features a neutral fermion $ψ$ and scalar $φ$, which are coupled predominantly to neutrinos in the form ${\cal L} \supset λ\,\overlineν_L\,φ\,ψ_R$. This interaction generates two corrections to the $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$ observables. The first one is a novel three-body decay process $M \to \ell \barψφ$. This process is enabled by the splitting of the off-shell anti-neutrino $\barν_\ell$ into $ψ$ and $φ$ in the $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$ diagram. The helicity suppression in $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$ is absent in the three-body process, thereby forming a potentially large contribution to real experimental results, provided $ψ$ and $φ$ are invisible. The second one is one-loop radiative corrections to the weak vertex $W\ell \barν_\ell$, which do not modify the charged lepton spectrum but lead to enhancement or suppression of the partial $M \to \ell \barν_\ell$ decay width. To demonstrate the ability of the leptonic meson decays to probe the neutrino portal dark matter, we compute two corrections analytically and compare the modified meson branching ratios with the experimental data on the lepton flavor universality of pion and Kaon decays. The resulting constraints turn out to surpass the existing bounds in a large part of parameter spaces.

### [19] [Good flavor search in $SU(5)$: a machine learning approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08154)
*Fayez Abu-Ajamieh,Shinsuke Kawai,Nobuchika Okada*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study addresses the fermion mass issue in SU(5) grand unified theory using machine learning, finding that the 24-dimensional field modification is more natural than the 45-dimensional one. Introducing a parameter y, optimized at ≈0.8, further enhances naturalness, suggesting this value represents the most natural model variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original SU(5) model by Georgi and Glashow fails to align with observed fermion masses, prompting exploration of modifications via 24- or 45-dimensional fields to restore consistency, aiming to determine which is more natural as per proximity to the original model.

Method: The paper employs machine learning techniques to analyze and compare the naturalness of SU(5) extensions with 24- or 45-dimensional fields. A continuous parameter y was introduced (y=3 for 45-D, y=1.5 for 24-D). Numerical optimization identified y≈0.8 as optimal for closeness to the original model.

Result: Results show the 24-dimensional field model is more natural than the 45-dimensional version in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric cases. Optimization determined y≈0.8 provides the closest naturalness to the original SU(5) model.

Conclusion: The most natural SU(5) extension under the defined criteria uses y≈0.8, indicating that deviations closer to this parameter value better preserve the original model’s simplicity, overcoming its fermion mass limitations through continuous parameter tuning.

Abstract: We revisit the fermion mass problem of the $SU(5)$ grand unified theory using machine learning techniques. The original $SU(5)$ model proposed by Georgi and Glashow is incompatible with the observed fermion mass spectrum. Two remedies are known to resolve this discrepancy, one is through introducing a new interaction via a 45-dimensional field, and the other via a 24-dimensional field. We investigate which modification is more natural, defining naturalness as proximity to the original Georgi-Glashow $SU(5)$ model. Our analysis shows that, in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric scenarios, the model incorporating the interaction with the 24-dimensional field is more natural under this criterion. We then generalise these models by introducing a continuous parameter $y$, which takes the value 3 for the 45-dimensional field and 1.5 for the 24-dimensional field. Numerical optimisation reveals that $y \approx 0.8$ yields the closest match to the original $SU(5)$ model, indicating that this value corresponds to the most natural model according to our definition.

Abstract: In this article, we take the $X(4140)$ as the axialvector tetraquark state with the symbolic quark structure $[sc]_S[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_A+[sc]_A[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_S$, and calculate the width of the two-body strong decay $X(4140)\rightarrow J/ψφ$ within the framework of the light-cone sum rules. Different from the traditional light-cone sum rules, at the phenomenological side, we introduce parameters $C$ to eliminate the contaminations from the higher resonances and continuum states, and match the hadron side with the QCD side of the correlation function based on rigorous quark-hadron duality to obtain the stable QCD sum rules. Then we obtain the decay width $Γ(X(4140)\rightarrow J/ψφ)=145\pm21\, \text{MeV}$, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data $162\pm21^{+24}_{-49 } \,\text{MeV}$ from the LHCb collaboration. The numerical result supports the possibility that the $X(4140)$ could be the $[sc]_S[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_A+[sc]_A[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_S$ type axialvector tetraquark state.

Abstract: Parton densities are obtained from a solution of the extended DGLAP-type evolution equation that includes both QCD and electroweak contributions. The equations are solved using the Parton-Branching (PB) approach, and the evolution is performed at next-to-leading order for QCD partons and leading order for electroweak bosons.
  The initial QCD parton distributions are fitted to HERA deep inelastic scattering data, while photon and weak-boson densities are generated perturbatively and validated against $dσ/dQ^2$.
  The resulting collinear and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) densities are provided in LHApdf and TMDlib formats for direct phenomenological use.

*D. -M. Mei,N. Budhathoki,S. A. Panamaldeniya,K. -M. Dong,S. Bhattarai,A. Warren,A. Prem,S. Chhetri*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a germanium phonon-to-charge transducer with a phononic-crystal region and RF-QPC readout for detecting low-energy dark matter interactions, achieving sensitivity down to 10^-43 cm² for cross sections across a wide DM mass range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the dark sector by detecting dark matter (DM) scattering with electrons or nucleons at ultra-low recoil energies (<10^-2 eV), which are inaccessible to conventional detectors.

Method: The transducer combines a slow-phonon phononic-crystal (PnC) region with RF-QPC readout at 4 K. A calibrated signal-collection model accounts for geometric guiding, phonon survival, and multiplicity-assisted detection. Background suppression uses timing gates and GHz-band spectral windows.

Result: Projected 100g module sensitivity reaches cross sections below 10^-43 cm² for DM masses 0.01-100 MeV/c² under halo assumptions. Sensitivities are shown for both heavy- and light-mediator DM models, with systematics quantified (thresholds, Q-factor, defects).

Conclusion: This design opens a new experimental path for the dark sector, enabling tests of models near solar CEνNS backgrounds. Future kg·yr-scale experiments are proposed to further probe these interactions.

Abstract: We present a germanium phonon-to-charge transducer that integrates a slow-phonon phononic-crystal (PnC) region with radio-frequency quantum point-contact (RF-QPC) readout at 4 K, and we evaluate its dark-sector reach. A calibrated signal-collection model, which combines geometric guiding, propagation survival, and multiplicity-assisted primary-phonon detection, provides selection-corrected thresholds in the $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$~eV range and a background model informed by nanosecond timing gates and GHz-band power-spectral-density windows. Under standard halo assumptions, a 100 g module achieves projected sensitivity to DM-electron and DM-nucleon scattering at recoil energies below $10^{-2}$~eV, probing cross sections below $10^{-43}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for $m_χ\in [0.01,100]~\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ (with efficiencies and thresholds folded in). We present sensitivities for both heavy-mediator ($F_{\rm DM}=1$) and light-mediator ($F_{\rm DM}\propto 1/q^{2}$) benchmarks, quantify dominant systematics (threshold, phonon quality factor $Q$, and bulk defect densities), and outline a staged program toward kg$\cdot$yr exposures that begins to test models approaching the solar CE$ν$NS background.

Abstract: The search for new sources of CP violation is a cornerstone of the beyond the Standard Model phenomenology programme at the LHC and beyond. We provide a comprehensive analysis of such searches at a range of future facilities with the aim of informing the currently unfolding future collider roadmap. Focussing on new sources of CP violation specifically in the gauge-Higgs sector, we demonstrate the outstanding potential held by future electron-positron and proton-proton colliders to reveal and identify BSM physics with direct relevance for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. In particular, the future colliders will provide an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to anomalous CP-violating interactions induced by dimension-six effective field theory operators when compared to the high-luminosity LHC programme.

Abstract: Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by "softening" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.

Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential of flavor changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) interactions in top quark decays at the LHC. A general two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is adopted to study the top quark decay $t \to c φ^0$, where $φ^0$ is either a CP-even heavy neutral scalar ($H^0$), or a CP-odd pseudoscalar ($A^0$), followed by the Higgs boson decaying into $τ^+τ^-$. The complete process is $pp \to t\bar{t} \to t cφ^0 \to (bjj) (cτ_{lep}τ_{had}) +X$, where $t$ or $\bar{t}$ become virtual when $m_φ > m_t -m_c$, $τ_{lep}$ and $τ_{had}$ represent the $τ$ leptonic decay ($τ^\pm \to \ell^\pm$ + MET) and the $τ$ hadronic decay ($τ^\pm \to j_τ$ + MET), respectively. We evaluate the cross section applying realistic selection criteria for the FCNH signal and the dominant physics background at the parton-level. In addition, we employ \textsc{MadGraph}, \textsc{Pythia}~8, and \textsc{Delphes} to perform a realistic event-level Monte Carlo simulation analysis. The collinear approximation is applied since the $τ$'s from Higgs boson decays are highly boosted such that $τ_{lep}$ and $τ_{had}$ momenta are approximately in the same direction as the $τ$'s, which enables the reconstruction of the Higgs boson mass. The energy of the charm quark provides an additional kinematic variable that discriminates the signal from the background. In the alignment limit, the FCNH couplings for the heavy Higgs bosons ($H^0$ and $A^0$) will not be suppressed [$λ_{tcH} \propto \sin(β-α) \approx 1$]. We study the discovery potential for the heavy neutral Higgs bosons at the LHC with collider energies of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, 13.6 TeV and 14 TeV, and find the High-Luminosity LHC offers great promise for the discovery of heavier Higgs bosons from $t \to c φ^0$ or $t^* \to c φ^0$.

### [26] [Metastable Strings and Gravitational Waves in One-Scale Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08546)
*James Ingoldby,Valentin V. Khoze,Jessica Turner*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores how metastable cosmic strings in dark sectors can account for the observed stochastic gravitational-wave background from pulsar timing arrays. Specifically, in single-stage SU(2)xU(1)→U(1) breaking models with one Higgs field, the Z-string's quantum decay via monopole-antimonopole pair nucleation is analyzed. The authors compute the decay rate using a thin-defect semiclassical approach and confirm that such models can fit Pulsar Timing Array data without requiring complex Higgs sectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a minimal, predictive theory explaining the detected gravitational-wave background using metastable cosmic strings in dark sectors, avoiding complicated multi-stage symmetry-breaking scenarios.

Method: Computed the semiclassical bounce action for decay rate of Z-strings via monopole pair nucleation in a thin-defect approximation, considering the string core and monopoles as localised defects with small core sizes compared to separation in the tunnelling configuration.

Result: Identified parameter regions where single-scale dark-sector models reproduce Pulsar Timing Array signals, confirming validity of the thin-defect approximation in phenomenologically favored areas.

Conclusion: Metastable Z-strings in minimal dark-sector models can successfully account for observational data, establishing a viable pathway for interpreting gravitational-wave backgrounds without requiring extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments. We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)\!\to\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole-antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, and verify that the thin-defect approximation remains valid throughout the phenomenologically favoured region, without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.

TL;DR: The PanRadio GRB program provides a systematic radio survey of southern Swift GRBs, focusing on GRB 230815A's 400-day afterglow. Despite high extinction and lack of redshift, its multi-frequency radio light curves show a two-component jet structure reconciling X-ray and radio observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study GRB afterglows and reveal outflow/environment diversity, particularly for GRBs like GRB 230815A that lack traditional follow-up due to observational challenges.

Method: A multi-year radio survey using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, tracking GRB 230815A's radio afterglow for 400 days post-burst. Analyzed radio light curves against X-ray data to model jet structures.

Result: Observed dissonance between X-ray jet break and radio evolution, attributing findings to a two-component jet with narrow (2.1°) and wide (≥35°) components. Radio emission followed self-similar blast wave expansion without microphysical changes.

Conclusion: PanRadio's comprehensive data enables detailed parameter analysis of GRB afterglows, highlighting jet complexity and providing new insights into GRB environments without needing redshift information.

Abstract: We introduce the PanRadio Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) program carried out on the Australia Telescope Compact Array: a systematic, multi-year, radio survey of all southern \textit{Swift} GRB events, comprehensively following the multi-frequency evolution of their afterglows from within an hour to years post-burst. We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of long-duration (collapsar) GRB~230815A, the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB~230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up due to its high line-of-sight extinction with $A_V = 2.3$. We found its early X-ray jet break at ${\sim}0.1$ days post-burst to be at odds with the evolution of the multi-frequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of $400$ days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to jet break, showing no evidence for evolution in the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes. We reconcile these features by proposing a two-component jet: the early X-ray break originates from a narrow component with a half-opening angle ${\sim}2.1^{\circ}$, while the evolution of the radio afterglow stems from a wider component with a half-opening angle $\gtrapprox 35^{\circ}$. The PanRadio GRB program will establish a sample of comprehensively followed GRBs, where a rigorous inspection of their microphysical and dynamical parameters can be performed, thereby revealing the diversity of features in their outflows and environments.

TL;DR: The study explores an entropy-based framework using multiple entropy measures and machine learning to classify gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae, finding that Rényi entropy with wavelet transforms and Relief-F feature selection offers the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for analyzing and discriminating gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae using entropy measures and machine learning.

Method: The researchers employed numerical simulation waveforms, analyzed them in time and time-frequency domains via short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms. They computed four entropy measures (Shannon, exponential, Rényi, Tsallis), applied three feature selection methods, and trained machine-learning classifiers to evaluate different methodological combinations.

Result: The most effective discrimination was achieved using Rényi entropy from the wavelet domain combined with Relief-F feature selection.

Conclusion: Entropy-based analysis, particularly Rényi entropy in the wavelet domain with Relief-F selection, provides a powerful approach for classifying gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae.

Abstract: We study an entropy-based framework to analyze gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae. We use waveforms generated by numerical simulations and analyze them in both the time domain and the time-frequency domain using short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms. From each representation, we compute four entropy measures -- Shannon, exponential, Rényi, and Tsallis -- and apply three feature selection methods to identify the most informative features. We then train machine-learning classifiers on these features to compare the performance of different methodological combinations. We find that the combination of Rényi entropy from the wavelet domain and the Relief-F selection method yields the most effective discrimination among different gravitational-wave signals.

TL;DR: This study investigates if FSRQs and BL Lacs can be sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Using LDDE functions and simulations of cosmic ray propagation, they find these active galactic nuclei (AGNs) significantly contribute to the diffuse UHECR flux and identify potential associations with observed hotspots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether FSRQs and BL Lacs are plausible astrophysical sources of UHECRs and understand their contribution to the observed diffuse flux.

Method: Computed redshift evolution of FSRQs/BL Lac populations using LDDE functions. Modeled UHECR propagation accounting for energy losses, generated sky maps with HEALPix to compare against Auger and Telescope Array data.

Result: LDDE-modelled AGNs can account for a significant portion of UHECR flux. Identified hotspots with associated galaxies/extragalactic sources aligning with observational data.

Conclusion: FSRQs and BL Lacs are viable primary sources of UHECRs, and the LDDE model provides constraints on their role in cosmic ray production.

Abstract: We examine whether Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) can act as plausible astrophysical sources of diffuse ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Using realistic luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) functions derived from observed gamma-ray luminosity functions for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we calculate the redshift evolution of the cosmic ray source population through integrated luminosity functions. The diffuse UHECRs flux from these sources is modelled by propagating nuclei through extragalactic space, including energy losses from interactions with cosmic photon backgrounds. The resulting UHECRs spectra are compared with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, with fluxes normalised at reference energies. In addition to spectral comparisons, we generate HEALPix-based sky maps and identify potential hotspots. Near these hotspots, several galaxies and extragalactic sources are found, suggesting possible associations with the enhanced flux regions. Our results indicate that LDDE-modelled AGNs could contribute significantly to the observed diffuse UHECRs flux and provide constraints on their role as dominant sources.

Abstract: Flexible and accurate interpolation schemes using machine learning could be of great benefit for many use-cases in numerical simulations and post-processing, such as temporal upsampling or storage reduction. In this work, we adapt the physics-informed token transformer (PITT) network for multi-channel data and couple it with Fourier neural operator (FNO). The resulting PITT FNO network is trained for interpolation tasks on a dataset governed by the Euler equations. We compare the performance of our machine learning model with a linear interpolation baseline and show that it requires $\sim6-10$ times less data to achieve the same mean square error of the interpolated quantities. Additionally, PITT FNO has excellent mass and energy conservation as a result of its physics-informed nature. We further discuss the ability of the network to recover fine detail using a spectral analysis. Our results suggest that loss of fine details is related to the decreasing correlation time of the data with increasing Fourier mode which cannot be resolved by simply increasing Fourier mode truncation in FNO.

### [31] [Revisiting the Possibility of a Sharp Phase Transition in Cold Neutron Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08380)
*Bao-Jun Cai,Bao-An Li,Yu-Gang Ma*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper argues that a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in neutron stars, often modeled with a pressure plateau in the equation of state (EOS), is incompatible with the regularity conditions of the Tolman-Oppeheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. This challenges existing models and proposes a new consistency criterion for EOS constraints using neutron star observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in previous studies of FOPTs in neutron stars and establish rigorous thermodynamic and structural criteria for evaluating dense-matter EOSs compatible with general relativity.

Method: Analytical examination of TOV equations' regularity conditions combined with thermodynamic consistency requirements, specifically testing EOS models with sharp FOPT plateaux against these criteria.

Result: A sharp FOPT plateau in the EOS violates TOV solution regularity, meaning such models cannot produce physically valid neutron star structures despite possible observational consistency in mass-radius outcomes.

Conclusion: Future studies must abandon EOS models with sharp pressure plateaus for NS interiors. The proposed structural consistency framework provides a critical tool for refining dense matter EOSs using neutron star observations.

Abstract: First-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in cold neutron stars (NSs) have been extensively studied and have provided valuable insights into the behavior of the densest matter visible in our Universe, although a strong consensus has yet to emerge. Revisiting the possibility of a hadron-quark FOPT from a new perspective, we examine the interplay between the coupled nature of gravity and microscopic interactions in Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and the fundamental requirements of thermodynamic consistency in NSs. We demonstrate that a sharp FOPT manifested as a plateau in the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$, i.e., pressure $P$ versus energy density $\varepsilon$, is intrinsically incompatible with the regularity conditions of the TOV solutions. Although numerical integrations of the TOV equations with EOSs incorporating FOPTs may yield seemingly reasonable mass-radius relations consistent with current observations, such results can mask underlying inconsistencies. Our analysis thus establishes a structural consistency criterion for constraining dense-matter EOSs using NS observables, complementing existing studies of possible phase transitions in NS interiors.

### [32] [A Novel Parameterization for Rapid Cooling in Supernova Remnants, with applications to the Pa 30 nebula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08519)
*Miranda Pikus,Paul Duffell,Soham Mandal,Abigail Polin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how cooling affects the evolution and structure of supernova remnants, particularly the formation of filamentary structures like the Pa 30 nebula. It introduces a parameter β to quantify cooling efficiency, showing that rapid cooling (β ≳ 400) leads to filamentary ejecta via Rayleigh-Taylor Instability suppression of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the peculiar filamentary morphology of supernova remnants like Pa 30, and to understand the interplay between cooling timescales and structural evolution in these remnants.

Method: A cooling framework is developed with a parameter β representing the ratio of cooling timescale to Sedov timescale. Simulations are performed to explore how different β values affect remnant morphology, focusing on the balance between Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities under varying cooling conditions.

Result: Rapid cooling (β ≳ 400) creates filamentary structures similar to Pa 30 by suppressing Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability mixing, allowing Rayleigh-Taylor fingers to dominate. Ejecta retain ~95-100% of their free expansion velocity, requiring an inferred explosion energy of ~3.5×10^47 erg and a cooling luminosity of ~10^36 erg/s.

Conclusion: Cooling plays a critical role in shaping supernova remnants' structures. The parameterized cooling model provides a framework to interpret observed filamentary morphologies, suggesting specific energy and luminosity requirements for Pa 30-like structures.

Abstract: We systematically study how cooling creates structural changes in supernova remnants as they evolve. Inspired by the peculiar morphology of the Pa 30 nebula, we adopt a framework in which to characterize supernova remnants under different degrees of cooling. Our cooling framework characterizes remnants with a singular parameter called $β$ that sets how rapidly the system's thermal energy is radiated or emitted away. A continuum of morphologies is created by the implementation of different cooling timescales. For $β\gtrsim 400$, or when the cooling timescale is shorter than $\approx \frac{1}{400}$ of the Sedov time, the ejecta is shaped into a filamentary structure similar to Pa 30. We explain the filament creation by the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor Instability fingers where cooling has prevented the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability from overturning and mixing out the tips. The ejecta in these filaments have not decelerated and are moving almost completely ballistically at $\approx 95-100\%$ their free expansion speed. In this rapid cooling regime, an explosion energy $\approx 3.5 \times 10^{47}$ erg is inferred. We also propose the cooling mechanism required to create these structures necessitates removing energy at a rate of $2\%$ of $E_{\rm ej}/t$, which implies a cooling luminosity of $\approx 10^{36}$ erg/s.

Abstract: We present a compact and reproducible method for general relativistic polarization transport in the Kerr metric that achieves median electric vector position angle (EVPA) residuals of $\langle Δ\mathrm{PA} \rangle \approx 0.09^\circ$, a 95th percentile of $0.31^\circ$, and a worst case $Δ\mathrm{PA} \lesssim 0.32^\circ$ for spins up to $|a/M|=0.9$, while maintaining a fivefold or greater speedup relative to a strict reference integrator. Across the benchmark grid, typical residuals remain at the sub-tenth-degree level, with only modest degradation ($Δ\mathrm{PA} \lesssim 2^\circ$) near the Thorne spin limit. Photon four-momenta $k^μ$ and polarization four-vectors $f^μ$ are advanced using a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme with cached Christoffel symbols, maintaining the constraints $u\cdot f=0$ and $n\cdot f=0$, where $u^μ$ is the ZAMO four-velocity and $n^μ$ is the disk normal, while keeping $k\cdot f \simeq 0$. A physically motivated gauge is enforced by projecting the polarization into the local zero-angular-momentum observer (ZAMO) screen at every substep, ensuring numerical stability of the orthogonality constraints. Accuracy and performance are benchmarked over a representative grid in spin, inclination, image-plane azimuth, and radius. The method comfortably meets IXPE and NICER polarization tolerances and approaches EHT requirements. The approach provides a practical foundation for future general relativistic polarimetry and simulation pipelines.

### [34] [Could the stochastic gravitational wave background from newborn magnetars be detected by the advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07856)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores the detectability of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from newborn magnetars using different formation mechanisms (α-Ω dynamo, convective dynamo, flux conservation) and finds that signals may be below current detection thresholds for advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope.

Motivation: Assess whether newborn magnetars' contributions to the SGWB can be detected by current and future gravitational wave observatories, given their role as significant potential sources due to their magnetic fields and spins.

Method: The authors analyze three magnetar formation mechanisms, incorporating anti-correlations between magnetic fields, spin periods, and distributions of initial dipole fields. They simulate SGWB signals for each scenario and compute signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for aLIGO and ET.

Result: The SGWB signals from newborn magnetars under all three mechanisms produce SNRs too low for detection by aLIGO and ET within one year: 0.37 (α-Ω dynamo), 0.0003 (convective), and ≤0.21 (flux conservation).

Conclusion: Newborn magnetars formed via these mechanisms are unlikely to be detectable by current or near-future gravitational wave detectors, suggesting other sources may dominate the SGWB or that different formation models need exploration.

Abstract: Newborn magnetars are important gravitational wave sources due to their ultra-strong magnetic fields and fast spins, and the entire population in the Universe may significantly contribute to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we investigate the SGWB from newborn magnetars and assess its detectability by the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET) based on three typical formation mechanisms of magnetars, i.e., the $α-Ω$ dynamo, convective dynamo, and magnetic flux conservation. For the two dynamo scenarios, when calculating the SGWB, we creatively incorporate the anti-correlations between the magnetic fields and initial spin periods $P_{\rm i}$ with the initial dipole-field distribution of newborn magnetars. For the flux-conservation scenario, a bimodal lognormal form is adopted to describe the distribution of initial dipole fields, and all magnetars are assumed to have the same $P_{\rm i}$. Our results show that the SGWB from newborn magnetars may be undetectable by the aLIGO and ET if the magnetars are formed due to these mechanisms since the signal-to-noise ratio of the SGWB with respect to the ET for an observation time of one year is only 0.37 for the $α-Ω$ dynamo, $3\times10^{-4}$ for the convective dynamo, and at most 0.21 for the flux conservation.
