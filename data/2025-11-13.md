### [1] [Hunting for Neutrino Texture Zeros with Muon and Tau Flavor Violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08679)
*Lorenzo Calibbi,Xiyuan Gao,Man Yuan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores two-zero textures in the minimal type II seesaw mechanism, linking them to charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) processes. It analyzes correlations among CLFV observables, highlights potential experimental discrimination using current neutrino data, and discusses renormalization group effects on the energy scale of new physics. Certain textures suppress $μ→e$ transitions while allowing $τ→μ̄ee$ within future sensitivity, yielding a 5-6 TeV cutoff for the effective theory. The study underscores the importance of τ CLFV searches and collider experiments, like Belle II and Mu3e, for probing new physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate how two-zero textures in the neutrino mass matrix lead to measurable CLFV processes. These structures arise from the minimal type II seesaw mechanism and offer a framework to test beyond the Standard Model physics, particularly at ultra-high energy scales where underlying flavor symmetries may operate.

Method: The method involves analyzing all allowed two-zero textures, quantifying CLFV observable correlations using neutrino oscillation data, accounting for renormalization group evolution, and comparing predictions with experimental sensitivities. Effective field theory techniques with CLFV spurions model the low-energy constraints.

Result: The paper shows specific two-zero textures predict distinct CLFV patterns allowing $τ→μ̄ee$ at detectable levels (even considering RG effects) while suppressing $μ→e$ transitions. The effective theory's cutoff scale reaches 5-6 TeV, demonstrating that current/future experiments like Belle II can test these models.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes that CLFV searches in τ decays provide complementary probes to μ-based experiments and collider searches for doubly charged scalars. The framework connects flavor structures to high-scale physics, reinforcing the necessity of multi-front experimental efforts.

Abstract: We revisit the minimal type II seesaw mechanism generating the Majorana neutrino mass matrix $M^ν$, under the assumption that two entries of $M^ν$ vanish. Such flavor structures are known as two-zero textures. Processes with charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), absent in the Standard Model (SM), can have sizable rates in this framework and are directly linked to the flavor structure of $M^ν$. For each allowed two-zero texture, we quantify the predicted correlations among various CLFV observables using current neutrino oscillation data and show that they lead to distinctive patterns of CLFV processes that could be discriminated between at running and upcoming experiments. In addition, together with information from colliders, the sensitivity of these correlations to renormalization group (RG) effects could shed light on the potentially ultra-high scale where new dynamics (e.g. some underlying flavor symmetry) give rise to the two-zero texture. Furthermore, we find that certain zero textures, although not third-generation specific, can suppress $μ\to e$ transitions while allowing the rate of the process $τ\to \barμee$ to be within the future experimental sensitivity, even when the RG evolution is taken into account. The lowest possible cut-off scale of the effective theory, constructed by treating the two-zero flavor structure of $M^ν$ as a CLFV spurion, can therefore reach $5-6$ TeV. Our results provide further motivation for searches for $τ$ CLFV at Belle II, as probes of new physics complementary to MEG II and the upcoming Mu3e, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, as well as for collider searches for doubly charged scalar bosons.

### [2] [Isospin-breaking in the $ππ$ scattering amplitude I: Effects due to the pion mass difference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08680)
*Gilberto Colangelo,Martina Cottini,Jacobo Ruiz de Elvira*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper initiates a series analyzing isospin-breaking effects in ππ scattering and pion form factor, focusing on pion mass differences. It modifies Roy equations for ππ scattering due to charged-neutral pion mass differences, solves them numerically, and discusses results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate isospin-breaking effects arising from quark mass differences and electromagnetic interactions, specifically addressing the impact of pion mass differences on scattering processes.

Method: Derive modified Roy equations incorporating pion mass differences, numerically solve them, and match with chiral representation of ππ scattering amplitude under consistent approximation.

Result: Presented numerical solutions of modified Roy equations with detailed analysis, showing how isospin-breaking effects manifest in ππ scattering observables.

Conclusion: The approach successfully incorporates pion mass-induced isospin-breaking into Roy equations, providing a framework for future studies on electromagnetic effects and improved precision in hadron physics.

Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers devoted to a detailed analysis of isospin-breaking effects in the $ππ$ scattering amplitude and the vector form factor of the pion. Isospin breaking originates from the mass difference between up and down quarks and from electromagnetic effects. The latter can be further split into effects due to the pion-mass difference and the remaining virtual and real photonic effects. In this paper, we derive the modifications to the Roy equations for $ππ$ scattering due to the mass difference between the charged and the neutral pion. We solve the equations numerically after matching them to the chiral representation of the $ππ$ scattering amplitude evaluated in the same approximation, which is also provided. Numerical results are presented and discussed in detail.

### [3] [Hadronic CP Violation in the 2HDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08681)
*Wolfgang Altmannshofer,Joachim Brod,Patipan Uttayarat,Daniil Volkov*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: First complete two-loop calculation of electric and chromo-electric dipole moments for light quarks and gluon, along with CP-violating interactions in the two-Higgs doublet model. Includes general Yukawa interactions and phases in the Higgs potential, plus renormalization-group summation of leading-logarithmic effects. Provides a Python implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate CP-violation mechanisms in the two-Higgs doublet model and quantify dipole moments critical for testing beyond Standard Model physics at colliders.

Method: Performed two-loop calculations incorporating general Yukawa couplings and potential phases. Used low-energy effective theory with consistent renormalization-group evolution for fermion contributions. Methods are model-independent for scenarios without new light particles.

Result: First full computation of specified dipole moments and CP-violating interactions. Demonstrated the importance of two-loop effects and renormalization-group improvements. Provided numerical tools for model exploration.

Conclusion: Shows that two-loop contributions significantly affect dipole observables in the two-Higgs doublet model. The developed framework enables precise predictions and is applicable to broader BSM scenarios without light states.

Abstract: We present the first complete two-loop calculation of the electric and chromo-electric dipole moments of the light quarks and the gluon, as well as contributions to CP-violating lepton-quark interactions, in the unconstrained two-Higgs doublet model. We include the most general Yukawa interactions of the Higgs doublets with the Standard Model fermions up to quadratic order, and allow for generic phases in the Higgs potential. We pay particular attention to a consistent treatment of all fermionic contributions in the low-energy effective theory, including a consistent renormalization-group summation of all leading-logarithmic effects. This latter part of the work is independent of the specific UV model and can generally be applied to a large class of models that do not introduce new light degrees of freedom. A python implementation of our results is provided via a public git repository.

### [4] [Global Determination of $|V_{us}|$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08682)
*Matthew Kirk,Danny van Dyk*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a global analysis of kaon and tau lepton decays to determine the CKM matrix element |V_{us}| and Kπ form factors using a unified form factor parametrization, achieving results between exclusive and inclusive decay methods and aligning with lattice QCD without its inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the ongoing uncertainties in the CKM matrix unitarity tests by providing a more accurate determination of |V_{us}| through a novel combined analysis of semileptonic and tau decay data, while connecting form factor regions computationally.

Method: A global fit employing a unified form factor parametrization for Kπ transitions to simultaneously analyze Kℓν, Kπℓν, τ→Kν, and τ→Kπν decays, enabling computational feasibility by linking semileptonic and pair-production regions.

Result: The derived |V_{us}| lies between exclusive K_{ℓ2} and K_{ℓ3} decay results, slightly higher than inclusive τ decay data. The K→π vector form factor at zero momentum agrees with lattice QCD without using those inputs. Pole parameters of Kπ resonances are also determined.

Conclusion: The method bridges exclusive and inclusive approaches, offering a robust |V_{us}| estimate while highlighting unresolved long-distance electromagnetic corrections as a critical future research area.

Abstract: In light of ongoing issues with the first-row unitarity test of the CKM matrix, we showcase a global fit to measurements of $K\to \ell ν$, $K\to π\ell ν$, $τ\to Kν$, and $τ\to Kπν$ decays for the first time. Fitting the semileptonic and 3-body $τ$ decay data simultaneously becomes computationally feasible because we employ a simple form factor parametrisation for the $Kπ$ form factor that manifestly connects the semileptonic and pair-production regions. We find good agreement with the data and use our analyses to infer $|V_{us}|$ and the parameters for the $Kπ$ form factors. Our result for $|V_{us}|$ sits between the results extracted from exclusive $K_{\ell 2}$ and $K_{\ell 3}$ decays and somewhat above the inclusive $τ$ decay result. Moreover, our results for the $K\to π$ vector form factor at zero momentum transfer are compatible with lattice QCD determinations, despite not using lattice QCD inputs for this quantity. We are further able to determine some of the pole parameters of the individual scalar and vector $Kπ$ resonances with masses below the $τ$ mass. We caution that our results account only for short-distance electromagnetic corrections but not long-distance contributions; this is due to the lack of a consistent description of long-distance corrections to the $Kπ$ matrix elements both above and below threshold for an arbitrary model of the form factors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the Ward-Takahashi identity at one-loop in the light-front (LF) formalism for a bound state of fermions. We consider a spinless bound state made up of two fermions in which the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied in the covariant formulation. Considering the same system in the light-front formalism, we investigate the proof of Ward-Takahashi identity by integrating the light-front energy component through the identification of the relevant ranges of the longitudinal LF momentum. We elucidate that the pair production diagram plays a crucial role in establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity. We also point out the necessity of taking into account the corresponding zero modes for truly establishing the Ward-Takahashi identity in the LF formalism.

### [6] [Correlations between heavy mesons and the creation of the charmonia, bottomonia, and $B_c$ mesons in high energy $pp$ collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08796)
*Jiaxing Zhao,Joerg Aichelin,Pol Bernard Gossiaux,Klaus Werner*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates correlations between heavy quark-antiquark pairs produced via different QCD processes in proton-proton collisions using the EPOS4HQ event generator, and compares theoretical predictions with experimental data on open and hidden heavy flavour mesons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different QCD processes that produce $Q\bar{Q}$ pairs affect the correlations and transverse momentum distributions of heavy flavour mesons, and validate the model against experimental data.

Method: Uses the EPOS4HQ event generator to simulate production mechanisms of heavy quark-antiquark pairs. Employs a Wigner density approach to calculate transverse momentum distributions of open and hidden heavy flavour mesons.

Result: Measured meson correlations and spectra align with theoretical predictions, showing that production mechanisms directly influence observed correlations and transverse momentum distributions. Successfully reproduces $B_c$ meson spectra.

Conclusion: Correlations between heavy mesons reflect their production mechanisms. The model's success allows inference about the spatial distribution of quark creation processes in collisions.

Abstract: The different QCD processes, which can produce a heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\bar Q$) pair, induce different correlations between the heavy quarks. Employing the EPOS4HQ event generator we study the consequences of these correlations and compare the calculation with experimental results on open and hidden heavy flavour mesons, measured in proton-proton (pp) collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We find that the measured correlations between heavy mesons are a direct image of the different production mechanisms, which contribute also in a different way to the transverse momentum distribution of open and hidden heavy flavour mesons. The latter are calculated in a Wigner density approach which also enables to reproduce quantitatively the measured $B_c$ spectra. This agreement allows conclusions on the spatial distribution of the heavy quark creation processes.

Abstract: This paper explores various aspects and implications of the initial configuration of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field at the beginning of our Universe. It is well known that the SM Higgs field features a deeper, more stable minimum at large field values. While it is possible that our Universe began and remained in the electroweak vacuum at all times, this scenario is extremely fine-tuned from the point of view of initial conditions. This fine-tuning can be ameliorated by the exponential expansion of spacetime during inflation: intriguingly, this requires at least $\sim 40$ e-folds of inflation, tantalizingly close to the $50-60$ e-folds expected from horizon and flatness considerations. The Higgs could thus provide the reason for a prolonged epoch of inflation in our cosmic history. Otherwise, the most natural initial state corresponds to our Universe initialized in the more stable but "wrong" Higgs vacuum, and subsequently driven dynamically to the weak scale vacuum during reheating. An important, hitherto unexplored aspect of this dynamics is that the barrier between the two vacua persists when the electroweak vacuum becomes energetically favorable, becoming arbitrarily small as the temperature increases, and therefore triggers a first-order phase transition. This transition produces ultra-high (megahertz to gigahertz) frequency gravitational waves (GWs), serving as a challenging but unique SM target for GW experiments. Novel pathways for various beyond the Standard Model phenomena such as the production of dark matter and baryon asymmetry also become possible in this configuration.

Abstract: Measurements of Higgs boson Yukawa couplings to Standard Model (SM) fermions constrain radiative mass models for those species. Such models, motivated by the observed fermion mass hierarchy, act as foils for the SM tree-level mechanism: we cannot claim to have verified the standard mechanism if other possibilities also fit the data well. We construct a benchmark model which generates the top mass at tree level, and the bottom, charm, tau, and tau Dirac neutrino masses at one-loop level. Current theoretical and experimental constraints on the model, including from Higgs decays, demonstrate it possesses viable regions of parameter space. We show that future improvements to measurements will not be able to rule out the model, only increase the scale of new physics required, illustrating how difficult it will be to verify the SM fermion mass generation mechanism with great precision. As a bonus, a dark matter candidate is shown to be capable of reproducing the correct relic density within the permitted parameter space.

### [9] [Search for light Dark Sectors with GeV Muon Beams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08950)
*Zijian Wang,Leyun Gao,Zhuo Chen,Cheng-en Liu,Jinning Li,Qite Li,Chen Zhou,Qiang Li,Yu Xu,Xueheng Zhang,Liangwen Chen,Zhiyu Sun,Ce Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to search for a sub-GeV dark Z' boson using muon beam experiments, improving sensitivity through advanced detector systems and BDT classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the existence of a dark Z' boson in the L_μ - L_τ gauge theory, which is required for sub-GeV light dark matter models. Current experimental setups lack sufficient sensitivity, necessitating new detection techniques.

Method: The method involves analyzing the process μe⁻ → μe⁻ X, where X decays invisibly. A muon beam (1-10 GeV from HIAF-HIRIBL or 160 GeV at CERN) interacts with a target, and scattered muons/electrons are tracked with silicon strip detectors. Background suppression uses a BDT classifier, with low activity in downstream detectors.

Result: The proposed approach can probe a Z' boson in the 10 MeV mass range. Using a full multi-telescope system with a 160 GeV beam at CERN (e.g., MUonE) offers nearly three orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a viable path to detect low-mass dark mediators, highlighting the potential of high-luminosity muon beam experiments in extending the reach for Beyond Standard Model physics.

Abstract: Sub-GeV light dark matter often requires new light mediators, such as a dark $Z$ boson in the $L_μ- L_τ$ gauge theory. We study the search potential for such a $Z^\prime$ boson via the process $μe^- \to μe^- X$, with $X$ decaying invisibly, in a muon on-target experiment using a high-intensity 1-10 GeV muon beam from facilities such as HIAF-HIRIBL. Events are identified by the scattered muon and electron from the target using silicon strip detectors in a single-station telescope system. Backgrounds are suppressed through a trained boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier, and activity in downstream subdetectors remains low. This approach can probe a $Z^\prime$ boson in the 10 MeV mass range with improved sensitivity. Nearly three orders of magnitude improvement is achievable with a full multi-telescope station system employing a 160 GeV muon beam at CERN, such as in the MUonE experiment.

Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.

### [11] [Emergent Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09034)
*Christian Canete,Archil Kobakhidze*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes that dark matter phenomena may be emergent from a 3-form gauge field interacting with ordinary matter and radiation, unifying dark matter and dark energy in a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative to particle-based dark matter, proposing an emergent phenomena explanation rooted in field interactions.

Method: Developed a field-theoretic model using a 3-form gauge field coupled to a cosmic fluid of matter and radiation. Analyzed how interactions between the 3-form and cosmic fluid create an emergent dynamical state identified as dark matter.

Result: Showed that the model unifies dark matter and dark energy within a single framework. Suggested that dark matter might not be particles, implying traditional detection methods could fail.

Conclusion: Traditional dark matter detection methods may be ineffective if the emergent scenario holds true. Highlights the potential for geometric/field-based explanations over particle-based dark matter models.

Abstract: We entertain the possibility that the phenomena typically attributed to dark matter may have a fundamentally emergent nature, rather than arising from new particle degrees of freedom. To illustrate this idea, we consider a field-theoretic model of a three-form gauge field coupled to a cosmological fluid composed of ordinary matter and radiation. In the absence of interactions, the 3-form gauge theory describes only a global, non-propagating state, which can be associated with dark energy. However, when coupled to the cosmic fluid, the theory gives rise to an emergent, dynamical in-medium state. We identify this emergent state of the 3-form gauge field with dark matter. Thus, our proposal provides a unified framework for the dark sector of the universe within the context of an interacting three-form gauge theory. Furthermore, we speculate that the three-form field may have a gravitational origin, potentially supported by the lepton-number asymmetry in the primordial plasma. If this scenario is correct, conventional direct and indirect searches for dark matter would likely be futile.

Abstract: Motivated by the enigmatic vector charmonium-like states, we investigate the strong decay behaviors of four kinds of tetraquark states, which are possible candidates for the $Y(4660)$, within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules based on rigorous quark-hadron duality. We take into account the vacuum condensates up to dimension 5 in the QCD side, and obtain the hadronic coupling constants therefore the partial decay widths of those states. The predicted width $61.5\pm7.3\,\rm{MeV}$ is in excellent agreement with the experimental data for the $Y(4660)$, which supports its interpretation as a $[sc][\bar{s}\bar{c}]$ tetraquark state with the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$.

Abstract: In hadron resonant scattering, there are four fundamental resonant parameters: real and imaginary part of the pole position, and the magnitude and the phase of the residue. Out of the four, the last one is the least understood. The search for the residue phase's physical meaning has focused on model-independent phases of the majority of the lowest-mass resonances. Here, we apply a simple mathematical identity to the amplitude in the complex plane to reveal the exact reason for the noticed regularity and show that there is no room for hidden physical variables in the residue phase.

### [14] [Impact of reactor antineutrinos on the neutrino floor in low-mass WIMP-like dark matter searches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09217)
*S. Das,V. K. S. Kashyap,B. Mohanty*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Reactor antineutrinos significantly increase the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches when detectors are within ~10 km, limiting sensitivity. Site selection must consider reactor proximity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the previously overlooked impact of reactor antineutrinos on dark matter detection, which defines the neutrino floor limiting WIMP searches.

Method: SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION of reactor antineutrino flux effects on SuperCDMS-like germanium detectors using discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations. Modeled fluxes as function of detector-reactor distance.

Result: Proximity to gigawatt reactors within ~10 km raises floor by orders of magnitude; beyond 100 km, contribution fades. Establishes reactor distance as critical siting parameter.

Conclusion: Future low-threshold dark matter experiments must prioritize reactor proximity in site selection and detector design to avoid neutron floor limitations.

Abstract: The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar, geoneutrino, diffuse supernova, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within about 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond roughly 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These results establish reactor proximity as a critical site-dependent parameter in defining the neutrino floor and provide guidance for optimizing the design and siting of future low-threshold dark matter experiments.

TL;DR: The paper examines third-order strongly intensive observables for forward-backward rapidity correlations in the PYTHIA8 model to analyze dynamical fluctuations in strongly interacting matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle statistical and dynamical fluctuations in nuclear collision studies, extending prior work on second-order strongly intensive quantities to third-order, enhancing sensitivity to phase diagram features.

Method: Using the PYTHIA8 model, the authors analyze third-order strongly intensive observables focusing on forward-backward rapidity correlations, leveraging the color string model's framework where correlations源自 single string two-particle interactions and string fusion.

Result: The analysis reveals how third-order observables behave under different string fusion mechanisms, providing a sensitive tool for detecting dynamical fluctuations beyond standard volume effects.

Conclusion: Third-order strongly intensive observables offer improved detection of dynamical fluctuations, supporting their use in refining phase diagram studies by reducing statistical contamination.

Abstract: Studies of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter created in nuclear collisions are typically carried out using event-by-event fluctuations. Well-known way to disentangle statistical and dynamical fluctuations is to construct special observables named strongly intensive which are free from trivial volume fluctuations. Within the color string model behavior of the second-order strongly intensive quantity $Σ$ is completely determined by the two-particle correlation function from a single string and the string fusion mechanism. In this paper, we analyze third-order strongly intensive observable for forward-backward rapidity correlations and test its behavior within the PYTHIA8 model.

Abstract: The laser of an intense electromagnetic field promotes the studies of strong-field particle physics in high-intensity frontier. Particle accelerator facilities in the world produce high-quality muon and proton beams. In this work, we propose the nonlinear Compton scattering to light dark particles through the collision between intense laser pulse and muon or proton beam. We take light dark photon and axion-like particle as illustrative dark particles. The cross sections of relevant nonlinear Compton scattering to dark photon or axion-like particle are calculated. We also analyze the background processes with missing neutrinos. The prospective sensitivity shows that the laser-induced process provides a complementary and competitive search of new invisible particles lighter than about 1 MeV.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study confirms that parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined using the NNPDF framework are invariant with respect to the choice of starting scale Q0, as results from fits at Q0 values between 1.0 and 1.65 GeV show consistent PDFs and stable fit quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether PDFs obtained through global analyses are independent of the arbitrarily chosen initial scale Q0, as theoretically expected due to QCD evolution's perturbative nature.

Method: Performed multiple NNPDF fits using different starting scales (Q0 = 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.65 GeV), then compared resulting PDFs and fit quality across these scales.

Result: PDFs from different Q0 values are consistent within uncertainties and exhibit stable fit quality, supporting scale independence.

Conclusion: The choice of starting scale Q0 does not affect PDF determinations in the NNPDF framework, validating theoretical expectations and confirming robustness of the method.

Abstract: In global PDF analyses, parton distribution functions (PDFs) are parametrised at a fixed input scale $Q_0$ and evolved to higher scales using the DGLAP equations. Since QCD evolution is fully determined within perturbation theory, the fitted PDFs should, in principle, be independent of the arbitrary choice of $Q_0$. In this work, we test this within the NNPDF framework by performing a series of fits at different starting scales, namely $Q_0 \in {1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.65}$ GeV. We find that the resulting PDFs are consistent within uncertainties and the fit quality remains stable across this range, therefore confirming the invariance of PDF determinations with respect to the choice of starting scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The $Λ$CDM model, while successful on large cosmological scales, faces challenges on small scales. A promising solution posits that dark matter (DM) exhibits strong self-interaction, enhanced through the narrow resonance or Sommerfeld effects. We demonstrate that the ``super-resonance" phenomenon, combining these effects, significantly amplifies the DM self-scattering cross section, enabling strong self-interactions for DM candidates in the $\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV mass range. This mechanism also enhances the DM annihilation cross section, causing early kinetic decoupling that renders the standard Boltzmann equation inadequate. By implementing coupled Boltzmann equations, we achieve precise calculations of the relic density for super-resonant DM, aligning with observational constraints.

TL;DR: The paper explores how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim7$) could form within the early universe through super-Eddington accretion fueled by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). It proposes that a 'critical regime' with relativistic sound speeds allows SIDM Bondi accretion to rapidly grow primordial black hole (PBH) seeds ($10\,M_\odot$) into $10^9$--$10^{10}\,M_\odot$ SMBHs by $z\sim7$, independent of environmental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard accretion and merger processes are too slow to form observed SMBHs by $z\sim7$. The study aims to resolve this 'timescale problem' by introducing a novel accretion mechanism involving SIDM.

Method: Analytical modeling of Bondi accretion with SIDM parameters, focusing on a relativistic sound speed regime where accretion rate depends only on SIDM mass ($m$). Simulations link PBH mass distribution and SIDM properties to SMBH growth.

Result: For SIDM masses $m\gtrsim10^{-2}\;{\rm eV}$, the mechanism efficiently grows SMBHs from small seeds without requiring special environments. This connects dark matter physics to black hole mass functions.

Conclusion: SIDM-driven super-Eddington accretion provides a viable pathway to early SMBH formation, offering a testable link between dark matter microphysics and cosmic structure observations.

Abstract: Observations of luminous quasars at $z\gtrsim7$ reveal supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with inferred masses $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^9 \, M_\odot$ formed within the first $\sim700$~Myr of cosmic history. Standard growth channels \textrm{ -- } Eddington-limited gas accretion and hierarchical mergers \textrm{ -- } face severe timescale restrictions. We consider a super-Eddington accretion mechanism aided by the Bondi accretion of a minimal model of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We demonstrate that in a {\it critical regime} with a near-relativistic sound speed, the Bondi accretion yields an accretion rate that depends only on the mass $m$ of SIDM, thus it is universal to the ambient environment. This critical accretion mechanism for $m\gtrsim 10^{-2}\; {\rm eV}$ can grow seeds as small as $10\,M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBH) in the early Universe into $10^9$ \textrm{--} $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ SMBHs by $z\sim7$ without fine-tuned environments. Therefore, given a mass distribution of PBHs and a value of $m$, the mass function of primary black holes at late time can be fully determined with masses ranging from stellar to SMBHs. This connects the microscopic physics of dark matter to astrophysical observations of black holes.

Abstract: Compton scattering is a fundamental process in QED with broad applications, yet its theoretical description at high energies is challenged by substantial next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections arising from double-logarithmic enhancements. To address this, we report the first calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) total cross section with full electron mass dependence. Our analysis reveals that the NNLO correction, albeit still containing double logarithms, is numerically small due to a suppressing prefactor. By identifying the origin of these logarithms in a kinematic regime featuring a Glauber electron exchange, we successfully resum the leading logarithmic series to all orders, obtaining a compact result in terms of a modified Bessel function. The all-order structure reveals a suppression mechanism, with double factorial terms in the denominator, which explains the negligible nature of higher-order contributions. The combination of our NNLO calculation and all-orders resummation delivers a reliable and precise prediction, poised to serve the needs of high-precision experiments in the foreseeable future.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified transformer-based methodology for training foundation models to analyze diverse collider processes involving 1-4 top-quarks and their backgrounds, using multi-task pre-training to capture universal patterns and enable cross-process correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for separate analysis frameworks for different top-quark processes and bridge the gap between analyzing conventional and rare high-multiplicity topologies in collider physics.

Method: A transformer model undergoes multi-task pre-training on combined simulated event datasets, employing adaptive attention mechanisms to preserve unique interaction patterns and establish cross-process correlations before task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: The architecture maintains sensitivity to rare 3t/4t topologies without compromising performance on conventional channels like $t\bar{t}$, $tX$, $t\bar{t}H$.

Conclusion: This unified approach advances collider physics analysis by unifying diverse process frameworks into a single model architecture.

Abstract: We present a methodology for training foundational transformer models capable of processing collider data with diverse kinematic signatures. Our universal foundation model is designed for simultaneous analysis of all processes involving from one to four top-quarks production with their corresponding background processes. The approach employs multi-task pre-training on combined datasets of simulated events, enabling the model to capture the full spectrum of interaction physics while extracting universal patterns across different final states prior to task-specific fine-tuning. This unified architecture eliminates the need for separate analysis frameworks for different final signatures and specific tasks. The transformer-based pre-training strategy explicitly preserves unique interaction patterns through adaptive attention mechanisms while establishing cross-process correlations. We plan to demonstrate how this architecture maintains sensitivity to rare high-multiplicity topologies (3t and 4t) without compromising performance on conventional channels ($t\bar{t}$, $tX$, $t\bar{t}H$), effectively bridging the gap between disparate analysis paradigms in collider physics.

Abstract: We develop a fully expectation--value formulation of the GUP/Bekenstein--bound (BEB) correspondence, building on \cite{Ali:2024tbd,Ali:2022ckm,Ali:2022ulp}. Using Dirac's commutator--Poisson equivalence, the BEB supplies an information backreaction on the GUP--deformed bracket; at saturation the residual uncertainty in a sector cancels, enabling \emph{operational} simultaneity of conjugate expectations and resolving the EPR tension without hidden variables. A single self-consistency then fixes intrinsic confinement scales: the full (linear$+$quadratic) GUP reproduces the hydrogen Bohr radius (electron) and the proton charge radius (hydrogen nucleus). The same correspondence predicts an information--controlled crossover from a short--distance complex (evanescent) regime to an emergent real (Lorentzian) regime, with a symmetry flow from complex $SU(4)$ frames to $SO(1,3)$; under scale transmutation the short--distance $SU(4)$ is repurposed as the Pati--Salam $SU(4)_c$. Incorporating exterior--field entropy at horizons defines an effective Planck constant consistent with generalized--entropy extremality, tying entropy--area physics directly to the GUP at the expectation level.

Abstract: In linear perturbation theory for Kerr black holes, there are two equivalent formalisms, namely the Teukolsky and the Sasaki-Nakamura (SN) formalism. Typically, one defaults to the Teukolsky formalism, especially when calculating extreme mass ratio inspiral waveforms, and uses the SN formalism when dealing with extended sources, as it offers superior convergence when employing the Green's function method for calculating the inhomogeneous solution. In this work, we present a new scheme for solving the inhomogeneous SN equation, based on integration by parts, that eliminates the extra radial integration step required in the standard formulation to construct the source term for convolution with the SN variable. Our approach enables efficient computations of gravitational waveforms within the SN formalism in all cases, from compact to extended sources. We validate our scheme and code implementation against the literature and find excellent agreement, achieving comparable performance without employing any special optimization techniques.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores quasinormal modes in ultracompact horizonless objects, explaining their suppressed excitation and role in gravitational wave echoes. It proposes a waveform model combining standard and cavity modes and discusses the stability of these modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the excitation, stability, and echo signals of ultracompact horizonless objects, and to provide a unified framework for their spectral properties in gravitational wave observations.

Method: Analytical and numerical analysis of quasinormal modes, investigating their excitation factors and contributions to ringdown waveforms, including comparisons with black hole modes and extension to other exotic objects.

Result: Long-lived modes have suppressed excitation, contributing only at late times; echoes are structured into prompt ringdown, early echoes from moderately damped modes, and late echoes from long-lived modes. The proposed waveform model captures these dynamics, and the modes show robustness against perturbations.

Conclusion: The findings unify the understanding of ultracompact objects' ringdown signals, highlighting the importance of cavity modes and mode hierarchy, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy and testing general relativity.

Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical investigation of the quasinormal excitation factors of ultracompact horizonless objects. These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding excitation, stability, and echoes in ultracompact horizonless objects, with direct implications for their spectral properties and gravitational wave signatures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve isotopic analysis by incorporating continuous variables like body size to better understand ecological processes such as migration and diet.

Method: The bivariate FFn is developed using Approximate Bayesian Computation to model isotopic fractionation while considering continuous covariates. Case studies include horseshoe crab migration and spider crab dietary shifts.

Result: The model successfully identifies size-dependent migration in horseshoe crabs and dietary changes in spider crabs with increasing body size, showing improved accuracy over traditional methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating continuous covariates into isotopic models enhances understanding of organismal behavior and ecological processes, offering a more nuanced analysis than standard approaches.

Abstract: We revisit black hole perturbations through Heun differential equations, focusing on Frobenius power-series solutions near regular singularities and their connection formulas. Central to our approach is the notion of a cline in the complex plane, which organizes singular points of the differential equations and remain invariant under Möbius transformations. Building on the cline structure we identified in black hole horizons, we carry out a systematic reduction and relocation of poles in the differential equation to obtain explicit representations of the solutions. We illustrate our approach by extracting the scalar perturbation solutions for the 7-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole and deriving the static scalar tidal Love numbers. These results suggest that clines expose a Möbius-invariant order within black hole perturbations, rendering black hole perturbation problems remarkably tractable.

Abstract: We model the general relativistic interaction of a small hyperelastic sphere with a Schwarzschild black hole as it follows an initially marginally-bound orbit through a close encounter. While the interaction reveals effects that are encoded by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) multipolar equations through quadrupole order, the calculation is made using an independent general relativistic finite element scheme that we described earlier (Phys.~Rev.~D 108(8):084020, October 2023). The finite element calculation is done in Schwarzschild coordinates, following a large and scalable number of mass elements in interaction with each other through elastic forces derived from a potential energy function and with the spacetime geometry. After the fact, we analyze the dynamics using a local Fermi coordinate system, computing (1) the deviation of the center of mass of the body relative to the initial marginally-bound orbit, (2) changes in orbital and spin angular momenta, and (3) the decrease in orbital energy and accompanying deposition of energy into internal elastic dynamics. The interaction leads to the capture of the small body into a highly eccentric orbit ($e \simeq 0.99998$ in a sample calculation).

*Yakov Shlapentokh-Rothman,Mihai Tohaneanu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method to prove energy boundedness for high-frequency trapped waves on sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes without using integrated local energy decay (ILED). It extends this result to C¹-close metrics with stably trapped null geodesics where ILED might fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more robust approach for wave equations in spacetimes with trapped null geodesics, particularly avoiding reliance on ILED which may not hold in perturbed geometries.

Method: The authors introduce an alternative proof technique for energy boundedness that bypasses ILED by focusing on high-frequency projections of trapped waves. They apply this method to C¹-close metrics, explicitly showing the presence of stably trapped null geodesics.

Result: Energy boundedness is established for both original sub-extremal Kerr and C¹-perturbed spacetimes. The work demonstrates that boundedness holds even in cases lacking ILED due to trapped null geodesics.

Conclusion: The new proof framework provides a versatile tool for analyzing wave equations in spacetimes with trapping phenomena, broadening applicability beyond scenarios where traditional ILED-based methods are limited.

Abstract: On the full range of sub-extremal Kerr exterior spacetimes we give a new proof of energy boundedness for high-frequency projections of solutions to the wave equation onto trapped frequencies. A key feature of the new estimate is that it circumvents the use of an integrated local energy decay (ILED) statement. As an illustration of the robustness of the estimate, we use it to establish energy boundedness for solutions to the wave equation on stationary and axisymmetric metrics which are merely $C^1$ close to a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show explicitly that such perturbed metrics may possess stably trapped null geodesics, and thus one does not expect ILED statements to hold.

*Michael Wilson*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper establishes an r^{-3} curvature-decay rate as a critical threshold for distinguishing compact from non-compact perturbations in asymptotically flat manifolds, unifying the infrared behavior of spin fields in Einstein-Maxwell systems through spectral analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the universal geometric conditions governing the transition between compact and non-compact perturbations in gauge and gravitational theories, particularly regarding memory effects.

Method: Analyzing the linearized operator of the Einstein-Maxwell system, proving essential self-adjointness, and studying perturbation effects using spectral theory and finite-difference simulations.

Result: Confirmed that r^{-3} decay acts as a threshold; faster decay causes compact perturbations, while exact r^{-3} decay introduces delocalized zero modes at the spectral edge. Simulations matched predicted sky maps for memory fields.

Conclusion: The r^{-3} decay is a fundamental geometric boundary for infrared universality in gauge/gravity theories, connecting spectral properties to soft-theorem asymptotic symmetries and memory effects.

Abstract: We identify the $r^{-3}$ curvature-decay rate as a universal geometric threshold separating compact from non-compact perturbations of Laplace-type operators on asymptotically flat manifolds. For the coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we prove that the linearized operator $\mathcal{L}$ is essentially self-adjoint and that curvature and field strengths decaying faster than $r^{-3}$ act as relatively compact perturbations, while decay exactly at $r^{-3}$ places $0\inσ_{\mathrm{ess}}(\mathcal{L})$ through delocalized zero modes. This threshold mechanism unifies the infrared behavior of spin-1, spin-2, and mixed spin-$(1\oplus2)$ fields, linking the onset of spectral delocalization with the appearance of gravitational and electromagnetic memory. Finite-difference simulations corroborate the analytic scaling and reproduce the characteristic quadrupolar and dipolar sky maps predicted for the coupled memory fields. These results demonstrate that curvature decay at $r^{-3}$ constitutes a fundamental geometric boundary underlying infrared universality in gauge and gravitational theories, providing a spectral counterpart to the asymptotic-symmetry and soft-theorem formulations of memory.

Abstract: Thermal field theory is an essential tool for comprehending various physical phenomena, including astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as the early stages of the universe. Nonetheless, the traditional thermal field theory formulated in Minkowski spacetime is not capable of considering the effects originating from the curved spacetime. These effects are crucial for both astrophysical and cosmological observations, making it essential to extend the domain of thermal field theory to curved spacetimes. This article's primary focus is to explore the extension of thermal field theory to curved spacetimes and its implications. We employ Riemann-normal coordinates to describe thermal field theories in curved spacetime, and we also calculate several thermodynamic observables to demonstrate the curvature corrections explicitly.

### [30] [On the Limitations of a Generalized Vaidya Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09011)
*Soumya Chakrabarti,Naresh Dadhich,Chiranjeeb Singha*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that a generalized Vaidya metric cannot be smoothly matched to an exterior Schwarzschild/Vaidya spacetime at a finite boundary unless the mass function depends solely on the null coordinate. This mismatch leads to curvature discontinuities and requires a thin shell of matter, making the geometry unsuitable for describing a stellar interior with a regular boundary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the conditions under which the Generalized Vaidya metric can represent a viable stellar interior by smoothly matching it to an exterior spacetime, addressing inconsistencies in quasi-local energy flux and geometric invariants.

Method: Derivation of extrinsic curvature components and analysis of geometric invariants (e.g., $/mathcal{K}$, Kodama current) to detect curvature discontinuities when $/\/partial m / \/partial r 
eq 0$; study of timelike geodesics to verify boundary conditions.

Result: A discontinuity in curvature and the presence of a surface stress-energy tensor (thin shell) are found when the mass function depends on radius. The geometric invariants and geodesic analysis confirm the impossibility of a regular boundary under these conditions.

Conclusion: The generalized Vaidya spacetime with $/\/partial m / \/partial r 
eq 0$ cannot represent a bounded stellar interior. It should instead be interpreted as an unbounded geometry with intrinsic heat flux.

Abstract: We prove that there can not be a smooth matching of the Generalized Vaidya metric with an exterior Schwarzschild/Vaidya patch across a finite boundary hypersurface unless the mass function is a function of the null coordinate alone. By explicitly deriving the extrinsic curvature components, we show that for $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ one has a discontinuity in the curvature and induces a surface stress-energy tensor, corresponding to a thin shell of matter. This discontinuity also appears in the geometric invariant $\mathcal{K} = K_{ab}K^{ab}$ and in the Kodama current, indicating a mismatch in quasi-local energy flux across the boundary. The analysis of timelike geodesics leads to the same condition, reinforcing that the generalized Vaidya geometry with $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ cannot represent a consistent stellar interior bounded by a regular surface. We therefore note that the generalized Vaidya spacetime should be interpreted as an unbounded geometry with intrinsic heat flux rather than a viable bounded source.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores cosmological inflation using f(Q, Lm) gravity with symmetric teleparallel geometry, analyzing the impact of linear and nonlinear matter couplings on inflationary parameters. The linear model aligns with observational data for positive constants, while the nonlinear model requires negative constants and fits within Planck confidence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General Relativity has theoretical limits in explaining both early and late cosmic acceleration, prompting the need for alternative theories like f(Q, Lm) gravity to address these issues through non-metricity scalar coupling.

Method: The authors formulated slow-roll dynamics under f(Q, Lm) gravity with power-law inflaton potential. They derived analytical expressions for scalar spectral index (n_s) and tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) for both linear and nonlinear coupling models.

Result: Linear model (f(Q,Lm) = -αQ + 2Lm + β) shows viability with Planck+BK15+BAO data for positive α and β. Nonlinear model (f(Q,Lm)=-αQ + (2Lm)^2 + β) requires negative α/β and mostly lies within 68% confidence regions. Both models offer distinct viable regimes.

Conclusion: f(Q,Lm) gravity presents a competitive alternative to GR for inflationary cosmology, demonstrating viable solutions through different coupling scenarios that align with observational constraints.

Abstract: Cosmological inflation remains a key paradigm for explaining the earliest stages of the Universe, yet the theoretical limitations of General Relativity (GR) motivate the development of alternative formulations capable of addressing both early and late cosmic acceleration. In this work, we investigate cosmological inflation within the $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity framework based on symmetric teleparallel geometry, where the non-metricity scalar $Q$ couples directly to the matter Lagrangian. We formulate the slow-roll dynamics and derive analytical predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in both linear and nonlinear non-minimal coupling models, assuming a power-law inflaton potential. Our findings show that the linear case, $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})=-αQ + 2\mathcal{L}_{m}+β$, becomes compatible with Planck+BK15+BAO constraints for positive $α$ and $β$, producing narrow viable contours in parameter space. In contrast, the nonlinear model, $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})=-αQ+(2\mathcal{L}_{m})^{2}+β$, achieves observational viability only for negative $α$ and $β$, and its predictions predominantly fall inside the $68\%$ confidence region of joint data. These results demonstrate that $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity produces distinct inflationary regimes, providing a highly competitive alternative to GR.

Abstract: Motivated by a geometric understanding of the angular velocity of a Kerr black hole in terms of a quasi-conformal map that describes a 2d Beltrami fluid flow, a new way to construct initial data sets for binary rotating black holes by prescribing the angular velocities of the two black holes at their horizons is discussed. A set of elliptic equations with prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions at the horizons and at spatial infinity is established for constructing the initial data. To explore the dynamics encoded in these initial data, we consider the conformally flat three-metric case and numerically evolve it using the BSSN code for two co-rotating and counter-rotating black holes with angular velocities prescribed at the horizons. When the angular velocities are non-uniform and deviate from a constant value at the horizons, new gravitational waveforms are generated which display certain oscillatory pattern reminiscent of that of quasi-normal ringing in the inspiral phase before merger takes place.

Abstract: We solve analytically the low-frequency s-wave dynamics of a massless scalar field propagating on a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole background. A rigorous application of the method of matched asymptotic expansions allows us to connect the scalar's evolution in the proximity of the black-hole horizon with that on cosmological scales. The scattering coefficients, greybody factors, and Wigner time delay are computed explicitly. We consider both small and large black holes, with black-hole to cosmological horizon radii parametrically small and of order unity, respectively. This extends previous studies confined to the small black-hole regime only. In addition, for small black holes we perform a calculation that remains agnostic about the relative size between the ratio of the geometry's horizons and the scalar's frequency in units of the black-hole radius. When the two are comparable, we find that they are interchangeable in the greybody factor, which is symmetric under $ω\leftrightarrow 1/r_c$ (where $ω$ is the scalar's frequency and $r_c$ the cosmological horizon radius).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in quantum gravity testing by developing a feasible table-top experiment that doesn't require Planck-scale energies, addressing the lack of experimental evidence in quantum gravity.

Method: Analyzing two parametrically resonant oscillators (governed by Mathieu equations) coupled via Newtonian gravity, calculating logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement while considering random force noise and linear damping.

Result: Observed exponential growth of gravity-induced entanglement despite decoherence, demonstrating amplification through parametric resonance and revealing dynamical instability in such systems.

Conclusion: Parametric resonance offers a viable method to amplify measurable quantum gravitational effects in tabletop experiments, providing a new pathway for testing quantum gravity concepts without extreme energy requirements.

Abstract: Establishing quantum gravity theory remains one of the major challenges in modern physics, as the lack of experimental evidence makes it difficult to explore. In response to this challenge, proposals to test quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravity in table-top experiments have attracted significant attention as a potentially feasible approach far below the Planck energy scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping. As a result, we find an exponential growth of gravity-induced entanglement between the oscillators, which reflects the dynamical instability of parametric resonant systems.

*David S. Pereira,Salvatore Capozziello,Francisco S. N Lobo,José Pedro Mimoso*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores an extended hybrid metric-Palatini scalar-tensor theory (HMPST), introducing an additional scalar field φ to modulate curvature couplings. The study focuses on the linear-f(Ṙ) subclass, demonstrating its performance across cosmological, strong-field, and weak-field regimes. Solutions for cosmological scenarios, static symmetric configurations, and weak-field perturbations show agreement with observations, potentially unifying modified gravity theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building on the success of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, the paper aims to enhance the theory by including an extra scalar field to enable complex dynamics and self-interactions through scalar potentials, thereby expanding its applicability to diverse gravitational regimes.

Method: The paper examines the linear-f(Ṙ) subclass of HMPST theory, analyzing cosmological solutions (de Sitter, matter-dominated eras), static spherically symmetric metrics (extensions of Janis-Newman-Winicour and Buchdahl), and weak-field perturbations around Minkowski space to evaluate gravitational potential corrections.

Result: Key results include viable cosmological solutions for cosmic acceleration and early universe behavior, metric generalizations for compact objects, and Yukawa-type corrections in weak fields recovering General Relativity under certain scalar parameters. These validate the theory's consistency across scales.

Conclusion: The linear-f(Ṙ) HMPST subclass offers a unified, observationally consistent description of gravity across cosmological, astrophysical, and Solar System scales. It serves as a promising framework for linking modified gravity to observations and effective field theories.

Abstract: Hybrid metric-Palatini gravity unifies the metric and Palatini formalisms while preserving a propagating scalar degree of freedom, offering a compelling route to modified gravity consistent with current observations. Motivated by this success, we consider an extended framework -- the hybrid metric-Palatini scalar-tensor (HMPST) theory -- in which an additional scalar field $φ$ modulates the curvature couplings, enriching the dynamics and enabling nontrivial self-interactions through scalar potentials. We focus on the analytically tractable linear-$f(\hat{R})$ subclass and study its cosmological, strong-field, and weak-field regimes. In homogeneous and isotropic settings, we identify de Sitter and matter-dominated cosmological solutions describing accelerated expansion and early-universe behavior. For static, spherically symmetric configurations, the field equations yield analytic solutions generalizing the Janis-Newman-Winicour and Buchdahl metrics, including the Schwarzschild-de Sitter limit. In the weak-field regime, linearized perturbations around Minkowski space lead to Yukawa-type corrections to the gravitational potential, with an effective Newton constant $G_{\rm eff}$ and post-Newtonian parameter $γ$ that recover General Relativity for heavy or weakly coupled scalars. These results show that the linear-$f(\hat{R})$ HMPST subclass provides a consistent and unified description of gravity across cosmological, astrophysical, and Solar System scales, offering a fertile framework for connecting modified gravity to observations and effective field-theoretic extensions.

Abstract: Motivated by recent images of black holes in M87 and our galaxy, efficient relativistic ray tracing was developed to simulate the snapshots of variable emissions around the black holes. Half a century ago, the appearance of a moving emission source was addressed by Terrell and Penrose, who independently found that the aberration effect induces a conformal transformation on the observer's celestial sphere. Consequently, a snapshot of a moving sphere should remain circular. In this study, we examine the Terrell-Penrose effect with our ray-tracing simulations for two contrasting cases: i) static emission sources in the view of a moving observer, ii) and moving emission sources in the view of a static observer. In flat spacetime, it was believed that the images of the emission sources in these two cases are equivalent due to the relativity of motion. Our simulation demonstrates that although both cases remain apparent shape of the sphere, the apparent distortions of the images are different, and case ii) violates conformality on the observer's celestial sphere. Furthermore, we extended similar situations to a black hole spacetime. For case i), it is found that the conformal transformation induced by the aberration effect also holds in black hole spacetime, and is not restricted to observers in geodesic motion. For case ii), we study the slow-light effect on the moving sources, and show that the gravity introduces additional influence on the snapshots of a moving source.

Abstract: We investigate the imaging and polarization properties of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion flows. The MOG parameter $α$ introduces deviations from the Kerr metric, providing a means to test modified gravity in the strong field regime. Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $α$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $χ_{\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\angleβ_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $α$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime.

TL;DR: The paper explores the thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in noncommutative geometry, showing dependence on the noncommutativity parameter Θ and phase transitions akin to van der Waals fluids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how noncommutative geometry affects black hole thermodynamics and to investigate potential phase transitions and their relation to fundamental parameters like Θ.

Method: Derivation and analysis of thermodynamic functions for noncommutative Schwarzschild-AdS black holes, stability analysis, and comparison with van der Waals fluid behavior.

Result: Thermodynamic functions depend critically on Θ, phase transitions occur at a critical point, and Θ acts as a thermodynamic variable with Planck-scale magnitude, introducing temperature corrections.

Conclusion: Noncommutativity significantly impacts black hole thermodynamics, with Θ as a new variable influencing stability and phase behavior analogous to van der Waals fluids.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole within the framework of noncommutative geometry. We derive and analyze the black hole's thermodynamic functions, showing that they depend critically on the noncommutativity parameter denoted as Θ, while still satisfying the first law of thermodynamics. Stability analysis reveals that the noncommutative Schwarzschild-AdS black hole undergoes a phase transition at a critical point. Moreover, the thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of a van der Waals fluid, with the noncommutativity introducing a correction term to the black hole's surface temperature. Our results indicate that the noncommutativity parameter Θ is of the order of the Planck scale and functions as a novel thermodynamic variable within the system.

Abstract: We address the equilibrium configurations and stability properties of anisotropic compact stars whose interior is described by a modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) equation of state in the framework of the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) theory. Applying a quasi-local prescription for the pressure anisotropy, we derive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and integrate them numerically over a large parameter space in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $α$ and the degree of anisotropy $β$. We provide mass-radius sequences, mass-compactness, energy density, and pressure profiles, and perform a full stability analysis based on the turning-point criterion, the radial adiabatic index $γ_r$, and the radial and transverse sound speeds $v_r^2$ and $v_t^2$. Our results show that positive $α$ and positive anisotropy $(β> 0)$ systematically increase the maximum mass and radius, enabling then configurations that exceed $2\,M_\odot$ while still obeying causality and the modified Buchdahl bound in 4DEGB gravity. A comparison with the latest astrophysical constraints (NICER, GW170817, GW190814, and massive-pulsar measurements) identifies regions of the $(α,β)$ parameter space that are observationally allowable. In conclusion, anisotropic dark-energy stars in 4DEGB gravity provide viable, observationally testable ultra-compact alternatives to normal neutron stars and black holes, and also potentially open rich avenues for further multi-messenger searches for higher-curvature effects.

Abstract: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.

### [41] [Radiation-mediated shocks in gamma-ray bursts: spectral evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08684)
*Filip Alamaa,Frédéric Daigne*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the observable signals from radiation-mediated shocks (RMS) below the photosphere in GRB jets, finding they produce short, efficient pulses with evolving spectral shapes, supporting RMSs as viable origins for prompt GRB emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if RMS below the photosphere can explain the prompt emission features of GRBs, focusing on time-resolved signatures in early shock interactions.

Method: 1D special relativistic hydrodynamical simulations modeling internal collisions, followed by RMS simulations tracking photon distributions across shocks and downstream regions to calculate light curves and spectra.

Result: Simulations yielded a 0.1s pulse with 23% radiative efficiency, evolving spectra showing spectral hardening/softening trends, and distinct energy index behaviors in forward/reverse shocks at varying optical depths.

Conclusion: RMSs provide a plausible mechanism for GRB prompt emission, with observable spectral features matching key observed characteristics like peak energy decay and high-energy cutoffs.

Abstract: Radiation-mediated shocks (RMS) occurring below the photosphere in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet could play a crucial role in shaping the prompt emission. In this paper, we study the time-resolved signal expected from such early shocks. An internal collision is modeled using a 1D special relativistic hydrodynamical simulation and the photon distributions in the resulting forward and reverse shocks, as well as in the common downstream region, are followed to well above the photosphere using a designated RMS simulation code. The light curve and time resolved spectrum of the resulting single pulse is computed taking into account the emission at different optical depths and angles to the line-of-sight. For the specific case considered, we find a light curve consisting of a short pulse lasting $\sim 0.1$ s for an assumed redshift of $z = 1$. The efficiency is large, with $\approx 23$% of the total burst energy being radiated. The spectrum has a complex shape at very early times, after which it settles into a more generic shape with a smooth curvature below the peak energy, $E_p$, and a clear high-energy power law that cuts off at $\sim 5$ MeV in the observer frame. The spectrum becomes narrower and softer at late times with $E_p$ steadily decreasing during the pulse decay from $E_p \approx 250~$keV to $E_p \approx 100$ keV. The low-energy index, $α$, decreases during the bright part of the pulse from $α\approx -0.5$ to $α\approx -1$, although the low-energy part is better fit with a broken power law when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The high-energy power law is generated by the reverse shock at low optical depths ($τ< 30$) and has an index that decreases from $β\approx -2$ to $β\approx -2.4$. These results provide support for RMSs as potential candidates for the prompt emission in GRBs.

*P. Darc,Clecio R. Bom,Charles Kilpatrick,Bernardo M. O. Fraga,Gabriel S. M. Teixeira*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper uses symbolic regression to create accurate, interpretable analytic equations for the disk ejecta mass in binary neutron star mergers, outperforming existing models and offering new parameter constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for predictive and interpretable models linking compact binary parameters to post-merger phenomena, especially with gravitational wave sources having electromagnetic counterparts. Existing models like black-box ML lack interpretability and generalizability.

Method: The authors apply AI-driven symbolic regression trained on numerical relativity simulations to derive compact equations for disk ejecta mass. They test different predictor sets (e.g., masses and tidal parameters) and compare performance against traditional models relying on neutron star compactness.

Result: The symbolic regression models outperform existing fitting formulas statistically, maintain interpretability, and show robust generalization beyond training data. They match/exceed accuracy using tidal parameters instead of neutron star compactness alone.

Conclusion: SR provides physics-informed, transparent models useful for multimessenger astronomy and equation of state constraints. These models offer better generalization and new parameter options for analyzing neutron star mergers through electromagnetic observations.

Abstract: Gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts have highlighted the need for predictive, interpretable models linking the parameters of compact binary systems to post-merger remnants and mass outflows. In this work, we explore AI-driven symbolic regression (SR) frameworks to derive updated analytical relations for disk ejecta mass in binary neutron star mergers, trained on state-of-the-art numerical relativity simulations. Our method reveals a set of compact equations that outperform existing fitting formulae across multiple statistical metrics while remaining physically interpretable. Notably, SR also enables alternative predictor sets (e.g., $\{M_1,M_2,\tildeΛ\}$) that match or exceed the accuracy of models relying solely on compactness of the lightest neutron star ($C_1$), enabling new parameter constraints from electromagnetic observations. Unlike traditional black-box machine learning models, these closed-form expressions generalize robustly to regions of the parameter space not represented in the training data, offering a physics-informed tool for multimessenger observations and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper describes a variability-based strategy using Fermi-LAT data and normalized excess variance (NXS) to predict AGNs detectable by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), expanding the sample of sources with short-timescale variability estimates and aiding CTAO's extragalactic science program.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictions of AGNs detectable by CTAO by addressing limitations in current variability data (e.g., limited sources with short-timescale estimates) and enhancing target selection for the observatory's high sensitivity and broad energy coverage.

Method: The method uses Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data combined with NXS as a variability tracer. They extrapolated 30-day NXS values to 3-day timescales, increasing the sample from 87 to 407 sources. This identifies AGNs with flaring activity or at large distances suitable for CTAO's capabilities.

Result: Expanded the AGN sample with short-timescale variability estimates, improved target identification for CTAO, and provided data supporting the observatory's science program,即将纳入合作组的天体物理合作组论文.

Conclusion: The variability-based approach effectively enhances CTAO's target selection, aiding in studying AGN populations through improved detection predictions and informing future observational strategies.

Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will enable detailed studies of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the very-high-energy (VHE) regime, as the next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory, designed to enhance sensitivity and energy coverage (20 GeV -- 300 TeV) over current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). In the context of the CTAO Science Collaboration, within the AGN Population working group, we developed a variability-based strategy to improve predictions of AGNs detectable by CTAO, using Fermi-LAT data and normalized excess variance (NXS) as a tracer of flux variability. By extrapolating from 30-day to 3-day timescales, we expanded the sample of sources with short-timescale variability estimates from 87 to 407. This approach allows us to identify flaring and distant AGNs that are promising CTAO targets. The results are being used to support the CTAO extragalactic science program and will be included in an upcoming Consortium publication for the AGN Population collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin and evolution of MSPs in dense GC environments and predict gravitational wave transients from their binary interactions.

Method: Used the upgraded $N$-body code 	extsc{NBODY6++GPU} incorporating magnetic braking and accretion-induced spin effects to simulate MSP populations in intermediate-mass GCs, specifically focusing on M71.

Result: Simulations help explain the observed abundance of MSPs in GCs and provide insights into gravitational wave sources from such environments.

Conclusion: Dynamically formed binaries in GCs efficiently produce MSPs, and these systems are possible sources of detectable gravitational waves.

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are neutron stars with spin periods as short as a few milliseconds, formed through mass accretion from companion stars. In the dense environments of globular clusters (GCs), MSPs are likely to originate through dynamically assembled interacting binaries. Over 300 MSPs have been detected in GCs to date, more than half of the known Galactic MSP population. In this work, we model MSP populations in intermediate-mass GCs using the direct $N$-body code \textsc{NBODY6++GPU}. We update the code by implementing pulsar spin-down due to magnetic braking and spin-up through accretion, and use this framework to model the pulsar population in the globular cluster M71 to investigate the pulsar population within and the associated gravitational wave transients.

Abstract: We present a novel resonance mechanism that can naturally occur in neutron star binaries: a spin-orbit resonance. This resonance locks the binary into a unique state where the neutron star spin evolves alongside the orbit. The resonance requires a finite neutron star ellipticity $ε$ possibly sourced by strong internal magnetic fields in magnetars, which are motivated by population study of eccentric neutron star-black hole binary GW200105. We find that the locking probability is proportional to $\sqrtε$. We derive the phase correction in the gravitational waveform due to this resonance locking effect, and have conducted a search in all neutron star binaries up to the O4a gravitational-wave catalog, with no positive event found so far. Observations by next-generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, or even the upcoming upgrade of Advanced LIGO, have the potential to detect such locking signals, enabling precise measurements of both neutron star's ellipticity and moment of inertia. Future searches should be performed to discover this resonance, or, if undetected, to place constraints on the magnetar fraction in neutron star binaries.

Abstract: Arrays of precisely-timed millisecond pulsars are used to search for gravitational waves with periods of months to decades. Gravitational waves affect the path of radio pulses propagating from a pulsar to Earth, causing the arrival times of those pulses to deviate from expectations based on the physical characteristics of the pulsar system. By correlating these timing residuals in a pulsar timing array (PTA), one can search for a statistically isotropic background of gravitational waves by revealing evidence for a distinctive pattern predicted by General Relativity, known as the Hellings \& Downs curve. On June 29 2023, five regional PTA collaborations announced the first evidence for GWs at light-year wavelengths, predicated on support for this correlation pattern with statistical significances ranging from $\sim\!2-4σ$. The amplitude and shape of the recovered GW spectrum has also allowed many investigations of the expected source characteristics, ranging from a cosmic population of supermassive binary black holes to numerous processes in the early Universe. In the future, we expect to resolve signals from individual binary systems of supermassive black holes, and probe fundamental assumptions about the background, including its polarization, anisotropy, Gaussianity, and stationarity, all of which will aid efforts to discriminate its origin. In tandem with new facilities like DSA-2000 and the SKA, fueling further observations by regional PTAs and the International Pulsar Timing Array, PTAs have extraordinary potential to be engines of nanohertz GW discovery.

*Peer Anjum,Athar A. Dar,Zahir Shah,Bari Maqbool,Ranjeev Misra*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of the BL Lac object 1ES 1959+650's 2022 outburst reveals energy-dependent variability, with stronger fluctuations at higher energies. Multiwavelength data modeling supports a leptonic one-zone SSC emission model, except during VHE detection, where F1-state data led to SSC overprediction. Observed parameter trends suggest shock-driven flares, involving enhanced particle acceleration and magnetic-to-particle energy conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the emission mechanisms behind the pronounced 2022 outburst of 1ES 1959+650, particularly addressing the origin of its VHE detection and the observed variability patterns.

Method: Multiband temporal/spectral analysis using Swift/XRT/UVOT & Fermi-LAT data. Identified flux states, modeled SEDs with XSPEC using one-zone SSC model, and analyzed parameter trends across states.

Result: Found energy-dependent variability with γ-rays most variable. Detected 'harder-when-brighter' X-ray trend. VHE SED modeling discrepancies in F1-state, but consistency in others. Parameter correlations show increased Lorentz factor, decreasing magnetic field with flux, supporting shock acceleration and magnetic energy conversion.

Conclusion: Enhanced particle acceleration and Doppler boosting drive flares. Magnetic-to-particle energy transfer indicates shocks power emission. One-zone SSC model valid except during VHE flare's F1-state, suggesting additional emission mechanisms there.

Abstract: The high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object 1ES\,1959+650 exhibited pronounced activity between MJD~60310 -- 60603, including a very high energy (VHE) detection reported by LHAASO. To investigate the underlying emission mechanisms, we performed a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis using multiwavelength data from \textit{Swift}-XRT/UVOT and \textit{Fermi}-LAT, covering the optical/UV to GeV $γ$-ray bands. The source shows strong energy-dependent variability, with the largest fractional variability in $γ$-rays, followed by X-rays and UV/optical, consistent with leptonic emission scenarios. Based on the variability patterns, we identified distinct flux states (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, VHE-FX1, and VHE-FX2). The X-ray spectra exhibit a clear ``harder-when-brighter'' trend across these states. We modeled the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using a one-zone model incorporating synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission, implemented in \textsc{xspec} using $χ^{2}$ minimization. During the VHE detection, the corresponding X-ray/optical emission likely resembled the F2 state. Modeling the VHE SED using F1-state data led to an SSC overprediction of the VHE flux, whereas all other states were well described within the one-zone framework. Systematic trends in physical parameters are observed across flux states, including spectral hardening, increasing break energy, rising bulk Lorentz factor, and decreasing magnetic field with increasing flux. These results suggest that enhanced particle acceleration efficiency and stronger Doppler boosting drive the observed flaring activity, while the decrease in magnetic field indicates conversion of magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy, consistent with shock-driven scenarios.

*Jordan W. N. Moncrieff,Evgeni Grishin,Alessandro A. Trani,Fiona H. Panther,Olga Pietrosanti*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores the formation of black hole binaries with extreme mass ratios, like GW190814, through dynamical processes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) discs. Using simulations and analytical models, the authors link capture probabilities to disc properties and suggest low-luminosity AGNs as plausible environments for such systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observed diversity of black hole binaries, particularly those with highly unequal masses (e.g., GW190814), cannot be explained by traditional isolated binary evolution. Alternative dynamical formation channels, such as AGN discs, need to be investigated.

Method: The authors used the pAGN code to model AGN torques and TSUNAMI (a regularized N-body code with post-Newtonian terms) for dynamical simulations. Analytical models were developed to relate capture probabilities to AGN disc parameters, using a log-Gaussian distribution to describe the probability based on the parameter 𝓑.

Result: Simulations show possible outcomes like binary captures, mergers via mean-motion resonance, and mass ratio dependencies. The derived log-Gaussian parameters (A, μ, σ) quantify capture likelihood, and GW190814's formation is linked to low-luminosity AGNs (~10^43.5 erg/s).

Conclusion: Dynamical assembly in AGN discs is a viable pathway for extreme mass ratio mergers. Further parameter space exploration and population studies are needed to validate these models.

Abstract: As the number of gravitational-wave detections of black hole binaries grows, so does the diversity of proposed formation channels. The growing sample of systems with highly unequal masses, such as GW190814 with $m_1=23.2\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_2=2.59\,M_{\odot}$ -- corresponding to a mass ratio $q=0.112$ -- cannot be readily explained by isolated binary evolution and may originate through dynamical assembly in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate AGN discs capable of producing GW190814-like mergers using \texttt{pAGN} to model self-consistent AGN torques, coupled with \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code including post-Newtonian terms up to 3.5 order. Suites of N-body simulations reveal possible outcomes of binary capture and merger, mean-motion resonance interactions, and other novel dynamical pathways. We develop analytical models linking the branching ratios of captures and mergers to local disc properties, applicable to black hole populations across all mass ratios. Capture probability is primarily governed by $\mathscr{B}$, the ratio of libration time to resonance-width crossing, and is well-described by a log-Gaussian, $P(\rm{capture}|\mathscr{B}) = A \exp[-(\ln \mathscr{B}-μ)^2/2σ^2]$, with $A = 0.41^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $μ= 1.09^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, $σ= 1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$. This fit, while an upper limit, is useful for simplified population synthesis. Finally, we explore the mass ratio AGN luminosity parameter space and find that GW190814 may be formed in a low luminosity AGN of $L_{\rm AGN}\approx 10^{43.5}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$. A more systematic parameter space exploration and future population studies will further test our predictions.

Abstract: The ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) spectra measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the Telescope Array (TA) agree very well below $10^{19.5}$ eV but differ significantly at higher energies. We show that these differences can be explained by a single nearby source superimposed on a nearly isotropic background. Taking into account deflections in Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, such a source can account for the excess in the TA spectrum without producing excessive anisotropy. The required hard spectrum of the source and intermediate-mass composition are consistent with previous fits of the Auger-only spectrum and composition. This scenario offers several additional advantages: (i) the source produces a broad excess partially overlapping the TA hotspots, suggesting their possible explanation; (ii) without additional tuning, it reproduces the $\sim90^\circ$ shift in dipole direction observed between the Auger-only and combined Auger-TA analyses; and (iii) the best-fit position of the source lies near M82, the brightest nearby starburst galaxy, making it a plausible source of the UHECR.

TL;DR: The study identifies PKS J1309+1154 as a strong supermassive black hole binary candidate due to detected 17.9-year and 9-year periodic radio emissions, marking the third such discovery via long-term monitoring. This finding emphasizes the potential of future observatories to find many more SMBHBs and highlights the urgency for gravitational wave searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect SMBHB candidates through periodicity analysis in blazar light curves, which are critical for understanding binary black hole systems and validating gravitational wave predictions.

Method: Analyzed 46 years of radio monitoring data from UMRAO and OVRO at 14.5/15 GHz, identifying a fundamental 17.9-year periodicity and a harmonic 9-year periodicity in PKS J1309+1154's light curve using time-series analysis.

Result: Confirmed the presence of both a fundamental and harmonic period in the blazar's radio emissions, providing the first clear evidence of such dual periodicities, strengthening its classification as an SMBHB candidate.

Conclusion: This discovery reinforces the effectiveness of long-term radio monitoring for SMBHB detection, predicts future discoveries with advanced facilities like Vera Rubin and Simons Observatories, and urges immediate gravitational wave coordinated searches.

Abstract: We recently discovered a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidate, PKS J1309+1154, in the combined 46-yr University of Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory (UMRAO) plus Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) blazar monitoring programs at 14.5/15 GHz. The light curve of PKS 1309+1154 exhibits a 17.9 year periodicity. We also reported a hint of a first harmonic with a 9 year periodicity in this object. Further analysis of the PKS J1309+1154 light curve provides compelling evidence that both the fundamental and the harmonic are real, confirming the existence of real periodicities in blazar light curves. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of watertight evidence for a fundamental and a harmonic periodicity in a blazar light curve. It makes PKS J1309+1154 a \textit{strong\/} supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidate, and thus the third such candidate to be revealed through long-term radio monitoring, the other two being PKS J0805--0111 and PKS 2131--021, both discovered through the OVRO 40 m Telescope monitoring program. It is argued that hundreds of SMBHB candidates will be discovered by the Vera Rubin and Simons Observatories. Coherent searches for gravitational waves from a network of SMBHB candidates, starting immediately, are strongly motivated.

Abstract: We investigate the potential existence of a new population of BL Lacs, called ultra extreme high-energy-peaked BL Lacs (UEHBLs), whose synchrotron emission component peaks in the MeV band, extending the blazar sequence beyond its current limit. To model the spectral energy distribution of these new sources, we apply the hybrid shock-turbulence acceleration framework previously developed for extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs. We present three representative realizations that produce synchrotron peaks between $0.2$ and $2$ MeV and evaluate their multiwavelenght signatures. Our results show that UEHBLs would be undetectable with current GeV (Fermi) and future TeV (CTA) facilities due to severe Klein-Nishina suppression of inverse Compton scattering, but are ideal targets for proposed MeV missions such as COSI, AMEGO-X, and e-ASTROGAM. We further identify a sample of hard X-ray sources from the Swift-BAT catalogs that exhibit the expected spectral properties of UEHBLs, potentially representing the first observational hints of this population. If confirmed, UEHBLs would provide unique insight into particle acceleration in relativistic jets, imposing strong constraints on the maximum achievable electron energies. We also discuss the expected polarization and variability signatures, including the possibility of synchrotron-driven thermal instabilities leading to MeV flares. These findings underscore the critical importance of the MeV band for discovering and characterizing the most extreme accelerators among blazars.

TL;DR: The paper presents CPISM, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation tool for the CPI-C coronagraph on CSST, enabling the development of data processing algorithms through detailed optical and EMCCD camera modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support developing data processing pipelines and scientifically evaluating the performance of CPI-C on CSST, a simulation tool is essential for testing algorithms against realistic data.

Method: CPISM models CPI-C's optical system with HCIPy, simulating high-contrast imaging components like the apodizing filter and EFC optimization achieving 1e-8 contrast. The EMCCD camera model incorporates photon collection, EM noise, and readout effects with validated statistical improvements.

Result: Simulated a 1e-8 contrast dark hole meeting design specs, validated EMCCD model against test data, and demonstrated CPISM's capability to produce realistic observational data mimicking instrumental features.

Conclusion: CPISM provides critical support for CPI-C's data processing algorithm development and prepares foundational tools for future scientific exploitation of CSST observations.

Abstract: To support the development of the data processing pipeline and the scientific performance assessment for the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), we have developed the end-to-end instrument simulation program, CPISM. This paper details the core modules of CPISM that simulate the CPI-C instrument, focusing on the simulation of the high-contrast imaging optical system and the visible-band science camera. We modeled key optical components, such as the transmission apodizing filter, the wavefront corrector, and the focal plane mask using the HCIPy package. A $10^{-8}$ contrast dark hole region, consistent with design specifications, was simulated using the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) optimization method, and broadband observation effects were considered. For the science camera, which is an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), we established a detailed model encompassing photon collection, charge transfer, electron multiplication (EM), and readout processes, based on test data. This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift. We also proposed and validated an improved statistical model for the EM process to enhance simulation efficiency. CPISM can generate simulated images containing rich instrumental details, closely similar to the expected real observational data, thus laying the foundation for the development and verification of CPI-C data processing algorithms and preparations for future scientific research.

Abstract: We present measurements of the low-frequency noise of microstrip-coupled, lumped-element aluminum kinetic inductance detectors that use hydrogenated amorphous silicon parallel-plate capacitors (Al/a-Si:H MS-PPC-LEKIDs), which are under development for the Next-generation Extended Wavelength Multiband Submillimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC). We show that, under dark conditions, these devices are generation recombination (GR) noise dominated down to 0.1 Hz and, under optical load, they are likely dominated by GR and photon noise down to tenths of a Hz and possibly lower, both in spite of the use of a-Si:H PPCs. Our measurements set limits on the low-frequency two-level-system (TLS) noise of the a-Si:H material that are consistent with higher frequency measurements in the 0.1-10 kHz regime. These results establish that our MS-PPC-LEKID design for NEW-MUSIC will be photon-noise-limited under a range of observing conditions and, more generally, that a-Si:H PPC-KIDs are a viable new detector technology for even low modulation-rate applications such as astronomy.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper describes the optical characterization of AlMn KIDs for the 90 GHz band in the NEW-MUSIC instrument. AlMn was investigated due to Al's unsuitability at lower frequencies, and improvements were made to modeling techniques while testing additional parameters under BCS theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlMn KIDs were explored to overcome limitations of pure aluminum in the 90 GHz band, where its high pair-breaking energy is problematic. The study aims to enable NEW-MUSIC's broader spectral coverage and scientific objectives like galaxy accretion, cluster evolution, transient phenomena, and polarization studies of dusty sources.

Method: The researchers improved BCS model by removing analytical approximations for complex conductivity analysis of AlMn. They also tested a gap smearing parameter (common for high-kinetic inductance materials) but found it didn't enhance fit quality.

Result: Enhanced modeling techniques reduced fit parameter degeneracy in AlMn analysis. Gap smearing parameter addition didn't improve fits, indicating other factors may dominate in AlMn's behavior.

Conclusion: AlMn shows potential for 90 GHz KIDs with improved model accuracy. However, existing BCS theory extensions aren't sufficient, suggesting further material and theoretical studies are needed for optimized detector performance.

Abstract: We report on the optical characterization of the AlMn kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) in development for use in the Next-generation Extended Wavelength-MUltiband Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC) on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT). NEW-MUSIC will cover 80-420 GHz, split into six spectral bands, with polarimetry. This broad spectral coverage will enable study of a range of scientific topics such as the accretion and feedback in galaxies and galaxy cluster evolution via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, the transient synchrotron emission from the explosive deaths of massive stars and other time-domain phenomena, and dusty sources from low to high redshift (with polarization). Al KIDs have already been demonstrated for bands 2-5. AlMn KIDs will be used for the 90~GHz band, as Al's pair-breaking energy is too high. However, AlMn has only barely been explored as a KID material. To this end, we first improved the modeling techniques used for Al KIDs within BCS theory by eliminating the use of analytical approximations for the expressions of the complex conductivity and found these changes reduced fit parameter degeneracy in the analysis of AlMn. Then, we tested the addition of a gap smearing parameter, a standard extension to BCS theory in use for high kinetic inductance materials, and found it did not improve the fits.

Abstract: The Next-generation Extended Wavelength Multi-band Sub/millimeter Inductance Camera (NEW-MUSIC), located on the Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT), will be the first six-band trans-millimeter wave polarimeter. This paper proposes a broadband, hierarchical phased-array antenna with integrated band-defining filters necessary to realize NEW-MUSIC. It covers a spectral bandwidth of 2.4 octaves from 80~GHz to 420~GHz, a frequency range ideal for studying trans-millimeter emission from a range of time-domain sources, using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects to study hot plasmas in galaxy clusters and galaxies, and to observe dusty sources, from star-forming regions in our galaxy to high-redshift dusty, star-forming galaxies. To achieve these goals, three groups of superconducting lumped-element on-chip low-pass/band-pass filter-banks were designed to hierarchically sum the superconducting, broadband, non-resonant, slot-dipole antenna arrays and band-pass filter the trans-mm light before outputting it on microstripline to detectors (KIDs in the case of NEW-MUSIC).

Abstract: In this paper, progress in improving the coordinates uncertainty of extragalactic radio sources derived from astrometric and geodetic VLBI observations is investigated. For this purpose, 30 catalogs of radio source positions computed in 1997-2025 were analyzed. Over these years, the median source position uncertainty represented by the semi-major axis of the error ellipse for 467 sources in common to all catalogs improved by one order of magnitude: from 0.156 mas to 0.015 mas. It was also found that the improvement in the position uncertainty over time follows a power law with high accuracy. The number of observations used for determination of the coordinates of the common sources in the input catalogs increased over time from 1.3 to 14.4 million, also following a power law. A discussion of the results led us to the conclusion that the number of observations is the primary factor in improving the source positions uncertainty compared to the number of sessions in which the source was observed.

TL;DR: This paper presents simulation methods for testing the HSTDM data processing pipeline, crucial for calibrating and enhancing the accuracy of terahertz astronomy data from the CSST. The simulations address instrumental effects and observing modes to ensure robust pipeline performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The HSTDM pipeline requires rigorous testing to handle instrumental artifacts, data flow coordination, and varying observing modes, ensuring accurate and reliable science data for the global astronomical community.

Method: Two simulation approaches are developed: 1) HSTDM instrumental effect simulation using real test data and models; 2) observing data flow generation based on HSTDM's observing mode scenarios.

Result: The simulation methods were successfully implemented and proven effective in evaluating and improving the HSTDM pipeline's accuracy, robustness, and performance during development.

Conclusion: The proposed simulations enable iterative refinement of the HSTDM pipeline, supporting its modular evolution and ensuring readiness for CSST's terahertz astronomy missions.

Abstract: The High Sensitivity Terahertz Detection Module (HSTDM), a key component of the backend modules on board the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), will offer great opportunities for the discovery of Terahertz Astronomy, with implications that extend well beyond China to the global astronomical community.It is imperative that the raw data collected by HSTDM undergoes meticulous calibration and processing through the HSTDM data processing pipeline (HSTDM pipeline for short) to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the final science data to be archived for further research.This process necessitates that the HSTDM pipeline address instrumental artifacts and effects as well as the coordination of data flow of the scheduled observing sequences under all observing modes of HSTDM within the CSST automated processing environment.As the understanding of CSST HSTDM data processing develops during the pipeline development stage, it becomes essential to assess the accuracy, the robustness and the performance of the HSTDM pipeline under all observing modes of HSTDM so that components of the HSTDM pipeline be rationally added, removed, amended or extended within the modular framework.In this paper, we develop practical simulation methods to facilitate this need. The contribution of synthetic data generation of HSTDM observation includes two parts: 1. HSTDM instrumental effect simulation based on both real testing profiles and simulated models; 2. Observing data flow generation based on HSTDM observing mode scenario. The simulation methods have been implemented and shown to be practical in testing the HSTDM pipeline during the development stage.

### [58] [Detection of Lensed Gravitational Waves from dark matter halos with deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09107)
*Mengfei Sun,Jie Wu,Jin Li,Nan Yang,Xianghe Ma,Borui Wang,Minghui Zhang,Yuanhong Zhong*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework using a residual 1D-CNN to identify lensed gravitational waves (GWs) in multiband observations, improving detection accuracy compared to single detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lensed GWs offer insights into dark matter substructures, but their faint signals are hard to detect in noise. Existing single-detector methods are insufficient, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The method employs a residual 1D-CNN to classify multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems observed by DECIGO (early inspiral) and ET (late inspiral). It distinguishes five classes: noise, unlensed GWs, and three lensed profiles (SIS, CIS, NFW).

Result: A dataset of 1 million simulations (SNR 5-100) yielded 97.0% accuracy and 0.97 F1-score. Multiband outperformed single detectors (DECIGO: 72.8%, ET: 62.3%). Low-SNR (SNR<20) accuracy was 63%+, high-SNR (SNR>80) approached 99.8%.

Conclusion: Multiband GW observations significantly boost lensed GW detection in noisy data, enabling robust automated identification for future studies on dark matter substructures.

Abstract: Lensed gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new window into the study of dark matter substructures, yet the faint interference signatures they produce are buried in detector noise. To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations.

Abstract: Radiative transfer is a key bottleneck in computational astrophysics: it is nonlocal, stiff, and tightly coupled to hydrodynamics. We introduce Ray-trax, a GPU-oriented, fully differentiable 3D ray tracer written in JAX that solves the time-dependent emission--absorption problem and runs directly on turbulent gas fields produced by hydrodynamic simulations. The method favors the widely used on-the-fly emission--absorption approximation, which is state of the art in many production hydro codes when scattering is isotropic. Ray-trax vectorizes across rays and sources, supports arbitrarily many frequency bins without architectural changes, and exposes end-to-end gradients, making it straightforward to couple with differentiable hydro solvers while preserving differentiability. We validate against analytical solutions, demonstrate propagation in turbulent media, and perform a simple inverse problem via gradient-based optimization. In practice, the memory footprint scales as $\mathcal{O}(N_{\text{src}}\,N_{\text{cells}})$ while remaining highly efficient on accelerators.

TL;DR: The POLAR-2 mission aims to improve upon its predecessor by enhancing sensitivity and expanding the energy range to better study GRB polarization, addressing current limitations in understanding GRB prompt emission mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve uncertainties in GRB prompt emission by overcoming POLAR's limitations: low sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range, which hindered detailed time/energy-resolved analyses.

Method: POLAR-2 uses 100 modules with 64 plastic scintillator bars each, Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs), and an extended 30-800 keV range. It leverages Compton scattering to measure polarization, validated via 2023 ESRF beam tests.

Result: Expected to provide larger GRB polarization dataset with improved temporal and spectral resolution, enabling differentiation between emission models.

Conclusion: POLAR-2's advanced design will advance understanding of GRB jet structures, magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms upon its 2027 launch.

Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023. The instrument was developed by a joint effort of Switzerland, China, Poland and Germany and is planned for launch in 2027. Currently, POLAR-2 is in its production phase with the first module targets being produced. We will provide an overview of the current status of the development.

Motivation: The mission addresses the need for precise measurements of lunar radiation environment to advance fundamental space physics, lunar geology, space weather forecasting, and radiation risk mitigation for human missions.

Method: Uses two instruments: Pix.PAN (magnetic spectrometer for 100 MeV-10 GeV charged particles) and NeuPix (active pixel sensor for neutrons, gamma-rays, and 10-100 MeV particles). Both leverage advanced silicon sensor technologies for high-resolution spectral analysis.

Result: Expected to produce comprehensive radiation field maps, precise particle spectra data, and improved understanding of lunar surface interactions. Will inform space weather models and astronaut safety strategies.

Conclusion: LunPAN's success will validate mission design and instrumentation approaches for small-scale lunar exploration, paving the way for future missions and enhanced radiation risk assessment methodologies.

Abstract: LunPAN (Lunar Particle Analyzer Network) is a three-year mission proposal designed to comprehensively map the particle spectra in the lunar radiation field. It aims to provide precise measurements of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), Solar Energetic Particles (SEP), and albedo particles, including charged particles, neutrons, and gamma-rays, originating from the Moon's surface. Therefore it will contribute to fundamental space physics, lunar geology sciences, space weather prediction, and radiation risk assessment for future lunar explorations. This is achieved through two state-of-the-art instruments; Pix.PAN and NeuPix. Pix.PAN is a compact magnetic spectrometer designed for precise measurements of penetrating charged particles, ranging from 100 MeV to 10 GeV. Based on the Mini.PAN project, Pix.PAN employs thin silicon pixel sensors optimized for energy resolution and particle identification. NeuPix is a hybrid active pixel sensor system capable of detecting neutrons, gamma-rays, and lower-energy charged particles between 10MeV and 100 MeV. Utilizing innovative sensor-converter combinations, NeuPix will provide spectral measurements of lunar albedo neutrons and gamma-ray fluxes. Currently, the LunPAN mission is accepted by ESA's "Small Missions for Exploration - Destination the Moon" call for a pre-A phase study. We will discuss mission outline and expected scientific performance of the PixPAN and NeuPix.

Abstract: The spatial sensitivity pattern of millimeter-wavelength receivers is an important diagnostic of performance and is affected by the alignment of coupling optics. Characterization can be challenging in the field, particularly in the decentered and tightly packed optical configurations that are employed for many astronomical millimeter-wave cameras. In this paper, we present the design and performance of a lightweight and reconfigurable beam mapper, consisting of a bank of thermal sources positioned by a planar cable-driven robot. We describe how the measurement requirements and mechanical constraints of the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME) optical relay drive the design of the mapper. To quantify the positioning performance, we predict the beam patterns at each surface to derive requirements and use a non-contact computer-vision based method built on OpenCV to track the payload position with an accuracy better than 1.0 mm. We achieve an in-plane absolute payload position error of 2.7 mm (RMSE) over a $\sim$400 mm $\times$ 400 mm workspace and an in-plane repeatability of 0.81 mm, offering substantial improvements in accuracy and speed over traditional handheld techniques.

Abstract: We present the processing of an observation of Sagittarius A (Sgr A) with the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), part of the 2021-2022 commissioning run to verify TIME's hyperspectral imaging capabilities for future line-intensity mapping. Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $5.7 \times 10^5 M_\odot$, consistent with prior studies. These results demonstrate TIME's ability to recover both continuum and spectral-line signals in complex Galactic fields, validating its readiness for upcoming extragalactic CO and [C II] surveys.
