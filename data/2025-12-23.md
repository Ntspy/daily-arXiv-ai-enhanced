### [1] [Double-trace instability of BTZ black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16982)
*Oscar J. C. Dias,David Sola Gil,Jorge E. Santos*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates the linear stability of rotating BTZ black holes under massive scalar field perturbations with double-trace boundary conditions, revealing instabilities in both non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric modes, particularly noting that axisymmetric instabilities are fundamental and that such instabilities can occur even when global AdS3 remains stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how double-trace boundary conditions affect the stability of BTZ black holes, as previous studies showed stability under Dirichlet/Neumann conditions. This investigation aims to uncover new instability mechanisms and their implications for higher-dimensional black holes and scalar hairy solutions.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive study using linear stability analysis of rotating BTZ black holes under massive scalar field perturbations with double-trace boundary conditions. They analyzed both non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric modes, mapped stability boundaries, and compared results with global AdS3 stability.

Result: Key results include instabilities in both non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric modes, with axisymmetric being dominant. They found regions where BTZ black holes are unstable while global AdS3 remains stable, and identified onset curves for stability boundaries. Instabilities arise from energy/influx through asymptotic boundaries, not near-horizon effects.

Conclusion: The study establishes double-trace boundary conditions as a new source of BTZ instability, with axisymmetric dominance. It provides a model for understanding similar phenomena in higher dimensions and suggests the existence of rotating hairy black holes, as further detailed in a companion paper.

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the linear stability of rotating BTZ black holes under massive scalar field perturbations with double-trace boundary conditions. While BTZ black holes are stable under standard Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we demonstrate that they can develop instabilities when subjected to double-trace boundary conditions. Our key findings are threefold. First, we show that BTZ black holes exhibit instabilities not only for non-axisymmetric modes $\unicode{x2013}$ previously the only known unstable sector $\unicode{x2013}$ but crucially also for axisymmetric modes. Second, we prove that the axisymmetric instability is the dominant and most fundamental: configurations unstable to any non-axisymmetric mode are already unstable to the axisymmetric one. Third, we identify regions in the BTZ parameter space where these black holes are unstable while global AdS$_3$ remains stable, and we map the complete onset curves that determine the corresponding stability boundaries. Unlike conventional superradiant instabilities, the BTZ double-trace instability occurs for angular velocities always satisfying the Hawking-Reall bound. We trace the physical origin of these instabilities to the influx of energy and angular momentum through the asymptotic boundary permitted by double-trace deformations for a particular sign of the coupling, rather than to near-horizon effects. Our results provide a prototype for understanding double-trace instabilities in higher-dimensional rotating AdS black holes and suggest the existence of rotating hairy black hole solutions with scalar condensates, which we construct in a companion paper.

### [2] [A novel violation of the equivalence principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17020)
*Saurya Das,Mitja Fridman,Sourav Sur*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes that discrepancies between inertial and gravitational masses, which violate the equivalence principle, could be influenced by an object's distance from a gravitational source rather than its internal composition. It also presents a covariant framework for testing this idea.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the prevailing assumption that equivalence principle violations stem from an object's internal constituents, suggesting instead that spatial distance from a gravitating body might play a role, which could open new avenues for experimental testing.

Method: The authors develop a covariant theoretical framework to model how the mass discrepancy varies with distance. They likely use general relativity or modified gravity theories to derive equations showing this dependence and propose experiments or observations to test the predictions.

Result: The key result is the theoretical demonstration that the mass discrepancy can depend on the object's position relative to a gravitational source. This is illustrated through the covariant framework, suggesting possible experimental setups to measure such effects.

Conclusion: The conclusion argues that spatially varying mass differences offer a new perspective on equivalence principle tests, emphasizing the need for experiments to either validate or refute this distance-dependent hypothesis.

Abstract: It is generally assumed that any discrepancy between an object's inertial and gravitational masses, leading to a violation of the equivalence principle, arises from the nature of its internal constituents and their interactions. We show here that the difference can instead be a function of the distance of the object from a gravitating body, and suggest ways of testing this, illustrating side-by-side a covariant framework for the same.

### [3] [Deviations from Gaussian White Noise in Stochastic Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17070)
*Zahra Ahmadi,Mahdiyar Noorbala*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates how relaxing assumptions in stochastic inflation affects the noise characteristics, finding that deviations from the Bunch-Davies state or Heaviside window function produce colored, non-Gaussian noise, while deviations from de Sitter background only alter noise amplitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how relaxing key assumptions (background metric, window function, initial state) in stochastic inflation impacts the noise properties central to the framework, moving beyond the standard white noise model.

Method: Analyzes the effects of three modifications in stochastic inflation: non-de Sitter background, non-Heaviside window function, and non-Bunch-Davies initial states. Uses a piecewise linear window function toy model to calculate noise power spectra and memory. Examines two-particle state deviations for initial state effects.

Result: Deviations from Bunch-Davies or Heaviside introduce colored noise with memory and non-Gaussianity. Non-de Sitter only changes noise amplitude but keeps it white. Concrete examples show non-stationary power spectra and Gaussianity preservation except for initial state changes.

Conclusion: Stochastic inflation's noise properties are sensitive to initial state and window function assumptions, offering pathways to detect deviations from standard scenarios through colored/non-Gaussian noise signatures in cosmic microwave background observations.

Abstract: Stochastic inflation is widely used as a framework to study scalar field perturbations on an inflationary spacetime in a classical manner. In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise.

### [4] [A Search for Binary Black Hole Mergers in LIGO O1-O3 Data with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17204)
*Ethan Silver,Plamen Krastev,Edo Berger*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 'Machine learning pipeline for gravitational wave detection improves efficiency with neural networks, detecting 57 BBH events with manageble false positives and low-latency potential.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 'To speed up GW detection/classification/parameter estimation for timely electromagnetic follow-up, leveraging neural networks over traditional methods.'

Method: 'Used real LIGO data to train neural networks for BBH merger detection, applied to O1-O3 runs, tested with time-shifted data for FAR characterization.'

Result: 'Detected 57/75 cataloged BBH events with 57 false positives (mostly ruled out), demonstrated capability for low-latency detection.'

Conclusion: 'Highlights machine learning's potential for improving GW searches, enabling faster multi-messenger astronomy and setting foundation for future AI-driven analyses.'

Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by LIGO from the binary black hole merger GW150914, gravitational wave astronomy has developed significantly, with over 200 compact binary merger events cataloged. The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy.

### [5] [Quasinormal modes of thick branes in $f(R)$ gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17208)
*Yu-Peng E,Chun-Chun Zhu,Yu-Xiao Liu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates quasinormal modes of thick branes in f(R) gravity using three numerical methods, showing consistent results and arithmetic progression in real frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the stability and properties of thick branes in modified gravity theories (f(R) gravity) through quasinormal mode analysis, ensuring reliable results with multiple methods.

Method: Numerically solving the Schrödinger-like perturbation equation using three methods: asymptotic iteration, direct integration of the wave equation, and time-domain evolution. Analyzed parameter effects on effective potential barriers.

Result: All methods yielded consistent results. The real parts of quasinormal frequencies show an arithmetic progression, indicating resonances between potential barriers.

Conclusion: The consistency across methods validates the approach. The frequency progression suggests quasi-localized states arise from barrier resonances, offering insight into thick brane dynamics in f(R) gravity.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the quasinormal modes of thick branes in $f(R)$ gravity by numerically solving the Schrödinger-like perturbation equation of gravitational perturbations. To ensure the reliability of the results, we employ three complementary methods: the asymptotic iteration method, the direct integration of the wave equation, and the time-domain numerical evolution. We analyze how the model parameters influence the shape of the effective potential of gravitational perturbations and find that the structure of the potential barrier plays a significant role in shaping the quasinormal frequency spectrum. The results obtained from the three methods exhibit strong consistency, thereby ensuring the reliability of the calculations. In particular, the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies exhibit an approximately arithmetic progression, suggesting that the quasi-localized states can be understood as resonances between the barriers.

### [6] [Interplay of Lyapunov exponents, phase transitions and chaos bound in nonlinear electrodynamics black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17242)
*Chuanhong Gao,Chuang Yang,Tetvui Chong,Deyou Chen*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies Lyapunov exponents of chaos for massless and charged particles around a nonlinear electrodynamics black hole, linking them to phase transitions and chaos bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Lyapunov exponents can indicate phase transitions and violations of chaos bounds in black holes, particularly focusing on the relationship between these exponents and the stability of small black holes.

Method: Analyzed Lyapunov exponents for massless and charged particles around a nonlinear electrodynamics black hole. Investigated their correlation with phase transitions and chaos bound violations, considering stable branches of small black holes.

Result: Phase transitions are effectively signaled by Lyapunov exponents. Violations of the chaos bound occur exclusively in the stable branch of small black holes during phase transitions, and such violations persist regardless of phase transition occurrence.

Conclusion: Lyapunov exponents are a viable indicator of phase transitions in black holes. The stability of small black holes and chaos bound violations are intrinsically linked, even outside phase transition events.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents of chaos for both massless and charged particles around a non-linear electrodynamics black hole, and explore their relationships with a phase transition and a chaos bound of this black hole. Our results indicate that these exponents can effectively reveal the phase transition. Specifically, during the phase transition, the violation of the chaos bound occurs solely within a stable branch of a small black hole. Moreover, regardless of whether the phase transition takes place, the violations are observed.

### [7] [Between two descriptions of dark matter around a black hole: photon sphere, shadow, and lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17304)
*M. F. Fauzi,H. S. Ramadhan,A. Sulaksono*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper compares the observational effects of vacuum and Einstein cluster dark matter models around black holes, focusing on photon spheres, shadow radii, and lensing. The Einstein cluster model shows more significant deviation in shadow radius compared to Schwarzschild, while both exhibit unique lensing features due to the matter halo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies between existing dark matter distribution models by analyzing their observable effects, specifically photon spheres, shadow radii, and lensing, which are critical for testing theoretical models with astrophysical observations.

Method: The authors examined the vacuum model (negative radial pressure) and Einstein cluster model (zero radial pressure) by calculating their photon sphere properties, shadow sizes, and gravitational lensing observables. Comparisons were made against the Schwarzschild black hole solution.

Result: Key findings include contrasting photon sphere behavior between the models. The Einstein cluster model produces a more pronounced shadow radius deviation than Schwarzschild. Both models show distinct lensing effects attributed to their dark matter halos.

Conclusion: The models' differing observational signatures highlight the importance of considering anisotropic dark matter distributions when interpreting black hole observations. These results provide testable predictions for future observational studies to distinguish between theoretical models.

Abstract: We examine observational discrepancies of two widely used models describing anisotropic (dark) matter distributions around a black hole, focusing on their photon spheres, shadow radii, and lensing observables. The models considered are the vacuum and Einstein cluster dark matter model, characterized by negative and zero radial pressure, respectively. The analysis reveals that these models display contrasting photon sphere behavior. In particular, the Einstein cluster results in a more pronounced deviation in the shadow radius relative to the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Additionally, a distinctive lensing phenomenon associated with the matter halo is identified in both models.

### [8] [A Monte Carlo approach to stationary kinetic disks in the Kerr spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17346)
*Ghafran Khan,Patryk Mach*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper extends a Monte Carlo method to compute stationary solutions of the general-relativistic Vlasov equation in Kerr spacetime, focusing on razor-thin gas configurations in the equatorial plane. It examines monoenergetic models and Maxwell-Jüttner distributions, recovering particle current surface densities and analyzing angular momentum/velocity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance numerical methods for solving the general-relativistic Vlasov equation in Kerr geometry, enabling studies of accretion disks and relativistic systems where traditional approaches are limited.

Method: Extends a Monte Carlo scheme to Kerr spacetime using a particle-in-cell approach tailored for razor-thin equatorial configurations. Implements algorithms to handle boundary conditions at spatial infinity and calculate surface densities for particle currents, considering both monoenergetic and Maxwell-Jüttner distribution functions.

Result: Successfully retrieves particle current surface densities in both model types. Demonstrates the method's capability to analyze angular momentum and velocity distributions in relativistic kinetic disk models.

Conclusion: The Monte Carlo extension provides a robust tool for studying relativistic disk systems in Kerr spacetime, offering new insights into equilibrium configurations and their dynamical properties under general relativity.

Abstract: We extend a recently proposed Monte Carlo scheme for computing stationary solutions of the general-relativistic Vlasov equation to the Kerr spacetime. As an example, we focus on razor-thin configurations of a gas confined to the equatorial plane and extending to spatial infinity. We consider monoenergetic models as well as solutions corresponding to planar Maxwell-Jüttner distributions at infinity. In both cases, the components of the particle current surface density are recovered within the proposed Monte Carlo framework. Some aspects of razor-thin kinetic disk models, including an analysis of the bulk angular momentum and angular velocity, are briefly covered.

### [9] [Ghost-free 2-form fields in cosmology: implications for gravitational parity violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17348)
*Yuki Horii,Tomoaki Murata,Tsutomu Kobayashi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates parity-violating 2-form field theories with the same degrees of freedom as massive 2-form fields, identifying a two-parameter family of ghost-free theories. Parity-violating terms in the dual 2-form are absorbed via field redefinitions, leaving only parity-violating potentials. Cosmological application shows chiral gravitational waves can emerge from these potentials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether parity-violating, nonminimally coupled 2-form field theories can maintain ghost-freedom and the same dynamical degrees of freedom as massive 2-forms, addressing theoretical gaps in understanding such field interactions.

Method: Began with general kinetic terms and dimension-four couplings between 2-form fields and curvature tensors. Analyzed field redefinitions' effects on parity-violating terms, then applied the theory to a homogeneous isotropic cosmology with triplet 2-forms to study tensor perturbations.

Result: Discovered a two-parameter theory family but found most parity-violation absorbs into field redefinitions. Only potentials retain parity violation. Identified three tensor perturbation types (two dynamical) and demonstrated chiral gravitational wave generation from parity-violating potentials.

Conclusion: Parity-violating 2-form interactions beyond minimal setups are constrained by field redefinitions but still allow chiral effects via potentials. The findings offer new avenues for cosmological models with asymmetric gravitational wave signatures.

Abstract: We explore the possibility of parity-violating, nonminimally coupled 2-form field theories that retain the same dynamical degrees of freedom as a massive 2-form and thus are ghost-free. Starting from the most general kinetic terms and dimension four couplings between the 2-form field and the curvature tensors, we find a two-parameter family of such theories. However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical. We show that chiral gravitational waves can be generated in the presence of parity-violating terms in the potential.

### [10] [Origin of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations and Accretion Process in X-Ray Binaries around Quantum Lee-Wick Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17358)
*Orhan Donmez,G. Mustafa,M. Yousaf,Faisal Javed,Ikhtiyor Saidov,Farruh Atamurotov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines accretion dynamics and test particle motion around a non-rotating Lee-Wick black hole to study parameter effects on orbital stability and QPOs in X-ray binaries. Analytical and numerical methods show distinct observational signatures of Lee-Wick parameters in shock cones and QPO frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Lee-Wick black hole parameters affect orbital stability and QPOs in X-ray binaries, and to identify measurable observational signatures of higher-derivative gravity theories.

Method: Effective potential analysis of test particle motion and general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations (Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion) in two regimes (weak Block-1 and strong Block-2 Lee-Wick scenarios).

Result: Block-2 showed denser asymmetric shock cones and stronger QPOs at higher frequencies compared to Block-1 (Schwarzschild-like). Lee-Wick parameters S₁ and S₂ altered accretion morphology and frequency ratios near the BH.

Conclusion: Lee-Wick parameters leave detectable observational imprints on QPO frequencies and accretion flow structure, offering a testbed for higher-derivative gravity theories through future multi-wavelength observations.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the accretion dynamics and test particle motion around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric Lee-Wick black hole (BH) to reveal how the model parameters affect orbital stability and the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binary systems. The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories.

### [11] [Generalized Kerr-Schild gauge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17369)
*Enrique Alvarez,Jesus Anero*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Generalizes the Kerr-Schild gauge to non-null deformation vectors, showing they can yield finite curvature expansions and proving that such vectors must be geodesic for the deformed metric to be Ricci flat.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore extensions of the Kerr-Schild framework beyond null vectors and understand under what conditions non-null deformations preserve Ricci-flatness.

Method: Develop a generalized Kerr-Schild formalism allowing non-null deformation vectors, derive curvature tensor expressions to analyze finiteness, and establish a theorem linking geodesic vectors to Ricci-flat metrics.

Result: Demonstrates non-null vectors can generate finite curvature expansions and proves a necessary condition (geodesic property) for the deformed metric to remain Ricci flat.

Conclusion: Extends applicability of Kerr-Schild methods to broader spacetime scenarios, providing a foundational result for constructing solutions with non-null symmetries.

Abstract: The Kerr-Schild gauge is generalized to the case that the vector generating the deformation is not null. Contrary to naive expectations, this vector generates a finite expansion for the curvature tensor. We prove a theorem
  on the conditions for the deformed metric being Ricci flat, namely that the deformation vector must be geodesic of the background spacetime.

### [12] [Hydrodynamical Misner-Sharp Formulation for Gravitational Collapse in Scalar-Tensor Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17526)
*Jose A. R. Cembranos,Luis Diaz-Gimenez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a new hydrodynamical formulation in the Einstein frame for studying gravitational collapse in scalar-tensor theories, deriving TOV conditions and analyzing initial collapse phases and junction conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of gravitational collapse in scalar-tensor theories by developing a robust hydrodynamical framework inspired by Misner-Sharp, enabling valid initial conditions for simulations.

Method: Adopt a hydrodynamical formulation in the Einstein frame, derive Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equilibrium conditions, and apply these to model initial collapse stages and analyze junction conditions.

Result: Successful derivation of TOV conditions within the new framework, with demonstrated application to initial collapse phases and validated junction conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a reliable approach for simulating gravitational collapse in scalar-tensor theories, offering a foundation for future studies on black hole formation and scalar field dynamics.

Abstract: We study the problem of gravitational collapse in the context of scalar-tensor theories of Gravity. We introduce a new hydrodynamical formulation in the Einstein frame, inspired by that of Misner and Sharp. We obtain the equilibrium Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff condition that we use to find valid initial states of the problem within this framework. For illustration purposes, we present the minimal version of the initial phases of the collapse together with an analysis of the corresponding junction conditions.

### [13] [Advantages and disadvantages of maximally entangled states in dilaton black hole background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17535)
*Zhen Yang,He Cheng,Si-Han Li*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.

### [14] [GW231123: Overlapping Gravitational Wave Signals?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17550)
*Qian Hu,Harsh Narola,Jef Heynen,Mick Wright,John Veitch,Justin Janquart,Chris Van Den Broeck*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The analysis of GW231123 suggests that the gravitational wave event could be the result of two overlapping signals rather than a single black hole merger, which explains discrepancies in earlier analyses. The model with two signals is strongly favored, and ignoring this can lead to errors in estimating source properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in the interpretation of GW231123 across different waveform models and explore potential causes such as overlapping signals, lensing, or noise artifacts.

Method: Used a flexible model allowing two overlapping signals, compared it to single-signal models using Bayes factors, and analyzed the impact on source property measurements.

Result: Overlapping signals model is preferred with Bayes factors of 10²–10⁴, discrepancies between waveform models are reduced, and similar signals in overlapping data can cause observed inconsistencies.

Conclusion: GW231123 likely involves overlapping signals, explaining previous discrepancies, and underscores the importance of considering such scenarios in gravitational wave analyses.

Abstract: The recently discovered gravitational wave event GW231123 was interpreted as the merger of two black holes with a total mass of 190-265 $M_\odot$, making it the heaviest such merger detected to date. Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123.

### [15] [Equilibriums of extremely magnetized compact stars with force-free magnetotunnels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17874)
*Koji Uryu,Shijun Yoshida,Eric Gourgoulhon,Charalampos Markakis,Kotaro Fujisawa,Antonios Tsokaros,Keisuke Taniguchi,Mina Zamani*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents numerical solutions for stationary and axisymmetric equilibriums of compact stars with extremely strong magnetic fields. It explores mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, leading to the formation of a force-free toroidal magnetotunnel in extreme cases and introduces a new differential rotation law for force-free magnetosphere calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to study the effects of extremely strong magnetic fields on the equilibrium configurations of compact stars, particularly how mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields influence matter distribution and structural stability. The study aims to address gaps in understanding magnetized compact objects under MHD and force-free conditions.

Method: Numerical solutions were obtained by solving Einstein's equations, Maxwell's equations, ideal MHD equations, and force-free conditions. The interior uses ideal MHD, while the exterior applies force-free or vacuum conditions. A new differential rotation law was introduced for magnetosphere calculations.

Result: The extreme cases show that strong mixed magnetic fields form a magnetotunnel near the equator, expelling matter and creating a force-free region. Other models without the magnetotunnel were also generated, demonstrating varied equilibrium states under different magnetic field configurations.

Conclusion: The research highlights the significant impact of mixed magnetic fields on compact star structures, emphasizing the role of magnetotunnels in matter expulsion and the necessity of considering differential rotation laws for accurate modeling of force-free magnetospheres.

Abstract: We present numerical solutions for stationary and axisymmetric equilibriums of compact stars associated with extremely strong magnetic fields. The interior of the compact stars is assumed to satisfy ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) conditions, while in the region of negligible mass density the force-free conditions or electromagnetic vacuum are assumed. Solving all components of Einstein's equations, Maxwell's equations, ideal MHD equations, and force-free conditions, equilibriums of rotating compact stars associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields are obtained. It is found that in the extreme cases the strong mixed magnetic fields concentrating in a toroidal region near the equatorial surface expel the matter and form a force-free toroidal magnetotunnel. We also introduce a new differential rotation law for computing solutions associated with force-free magnetosphere, and present other extreme models without the magnetotunnel.

### [16] [Entanglement, equivalence principle, and HBAR entropy, in a new bumblebee black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17567)
*A. A. Araújo Filho,Wentao Liu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores quantum information and thermodynamic properties of a bumblebee black hole with Lorentz symmetry breaking. It analyzes entanglement measures, atomic excitation, and entropy production near the horizon, finding distinguishable vacua and confirming the equivalence principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking affects quantum information properties and thermodynamics in black hole spacetimes, and to test the validity of the equivalence principle under Lorentz-violating conditions.

Method: Analyzes near-horizon physics using quantum probes (inertial/accelerated observers and two-level atoms) in spacelike/lightlike Lorentz-violating vacua. Derives logarithmic negativity, mutual information, and transition probabilities using Rindler correspondence. Extends HBAR entropy analysis to bumblebee black holes.

Result: 1) Spacelike/lightlike vacua become distinguishable near the horizon at low frequencies via entanglement measures.
2) Atomic transition probabilities match flat spacetime expectations, upholding the equivalence principle.
3) Derived entropy production rate for infalling atoms in bumblebee black hole backgrounds.

Conclusion: Lorentz-violating parameters create observable effects near black hole horizons despite identical metrics. The equivalence principle holds locally in these scenarios, and bumblebee black holes exhibit unique thermodynamic behaviors requiring extended entropy frameworks.

Abstract: We investigate quantum information and thermodynamic properties of a new bumblebee black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking by analyzing near-horizon physics through complementary quantum probes. We study the degradation of quantum entanglement for field modes shared by inertial and accelerated observers in spacelike and lightlike Lorentz-violating vacua that generate identical spacetime metrics. Using the near-horizon Rindler correspondence, we derive analytic expressions for the logarithmic negativity and mutual information and examine their dependence on detector position, frequency, and Lorentz-violation parameters. Despite sharing the same metric, the two Lorentz-violating vacua become distinguishable near the horizon, particularly at low frequencies. We analyze the excitation of a freely falling two-level atom coupled to quantum fields near the horizon. The associated acceleration-radiation transition probabilities are computed explicitly. The resulting atomic response is locally indistinguishable from that in flat spacetime, confirming the validity of the equivalence principle even in the presence of Lorentz-violating corrections. Finally, we extend the notion of horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy to the bumblebee black hole and derive the corresponding entropy production rate induced by infalling atoms.

Abstract: We study slowly rotating black hole solutions within Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories. Starting from a static, spherically symmetric metric solution of a DHOST theory, we employ the Hartle-Thorne ansatz to model a slowly rotating spacetime. We show that the differential equation governing the frame-dragging function $ω$ (which is supposed to depend on the radial coordinate only) is integrable for any DHOST theory allowing us to obtain its explicit form. We also consider angular dependence in $ω$ and show that regularity at the horizon and at infinity forbids it, as in General Relativity. As an illustration of the formalism introduced here, we study the slowly-rotating version of black hole solutions with primary hair obtained recently, examining the influence of the rotation on the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and on the circular light trajectories in the equatorial plane.

### [18] [Revisiting particle circular orbits as probes of black hole thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17642)
*Lei You,Jinsong Yang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that the particle circular-orbit radius (r_c) monotonically increases with black hole horizon radius (r_h), showing non-monotonic behavior along isotherms for certain black holes. This发现 has implications for observational signatures of phase transitions and introduces r_c's monotonicity as a new thermodynamic probe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the validity of the monotonic relationship between r_c and r_h across different thermodynamic ensembles and black hole types, addressing gaps in previous studies which assumed monotonicity.

Method: Derived a universal criterion for drc/dr_h, applied it to d-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black holes, analyzed behavior along isobars and isotherms, and examined phase-transition regions.

Result: Discovered dichotomy where r_c(r_h) is monotonic along isobars but often non-monotonic along isotherms (except Schwarzschild-AdS). Confirmed monotonicity within phase transitions, established r_c's critical exponents equivalence to r_h's, and showed thermodynamic first law connections.

Conclusion: Non-monotonic r_c-r_h behavior provides new observational probes distinguishing thermodynamic processes, necessitating case-specific verification for other spacetimes, and underscores r_c's utility in probing black hole phase transitions.

Abstract: In recent years, jumps in the particle circular-orbit radius $r_{\rm c}$ have been proposed as observational signatures of black hole phase transitions, supported by the general consensus that $r_{\rm c}$ increases monotonically with the horizon radius $r_h$. However, in this paper, we will show that this monotonicity is not universally valid. By deriving a universal, ensemble-independent criterion for $\mathrm{d}r_{\rm c}/\mathrm{d}r_h$ and applying it to the $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black hole, we reveal a sharp dichotomy: while $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ exhibits strictly monotonicity along isobars, it typically becomes non-monotonic along isotherms (except for the photon sphere of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole)--a behavior that has been overlooked in previous studies. Nevertheless, we rigorously prove that within the phase-transition region itself, the monotonicity of $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ is preserved. However, the generalizability of this result to other spacetimes requires case-by-case verification, and its validity could have notable implications for the observability of the jump in $r_{\rm c}$. Interestingly, non-monotonicity itself acts as a new observational probe: the monotonicity contrast in $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ distinguishes isobaric from isothermal evolution, providing a complementary thermodynamic probe. Furthermore, we show that the critical exponents extracted from $r_{\rm c}$ match those obtained from $r_h$, independent of ensemble. Remarkably, all these phenomena are closely tied to the thermodynamic first law.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We review an approach that uses binary relations as the fundamental constituents of the universe, utilizing them as building blocks for both space and matter. The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom.

Abstract: Exploring gravitational theories beyond general relativity (GR) with black hole (BH) spectroscopy requires accurate and flexible methods for computing their quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum. A popular method of choice is the higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, mostly applied to nonrotating BHs. While previous studies demonstrated that the higher-order WKB method can also be used for Kerr BHs in GR, there has been little work on rotating BHs in modified theories of gravity. In this work, we revive the idea by extending WKB calculations of the Kerr QNM spectrum to higher order and assessing its accuracy against continued-fraction tabulated data. We then apply the WKB approximation beyond GR, comparing it against both linearized and continued fraction calculations in the parametrized beyond-Teukolsky formalism and in higher-derivative gravity (HDG) theories. We find that the frequencies computed by the WKB method in theories beyond GR have better accuracy than the measurement errors for GW250114, the event with the highest ringdown signal-to-noise ratio observed to date.

### [21] [Renormalization of the Quantum Stress Tensor Fluctuations and the Limits of Semiclassical Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17789)
*Alejandro Perez,Daniel Sudarsky*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the energy-momentum tensor's expectation values and fluctuations in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, focusing on semiflassical gravity's consistency. It uses the operator product expansion to study renormalized quantities and demonstrates squeezed vacua in black hole and inflationary scenarios violate semiclassicality criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure semiclassical gravity's conceptual consistency by ensuring energy-momentum fluctuations remain negligible compared to their expectation values.

Method: Uses operator product expansion to renormalize ⟨Tab⟩ and ⟨TabTcd⟩ for free scalar fields in curved spacetime with Hadamard states.

Result: Shows that squeezed vacua (relevant for black hole evaporation and inflation) fail the semiclassicality condition due to large fluctuations.

Conclusion: Semi-classical gravity frameworks may be invalid in scenarios involving squeezed vacua like black hole evaporation and inflationary cosmology.

Abstract: We analyze the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and its fluctuations in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$. A necessary condition for the conceptual consistency of semiclassical gravity, where $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$ represent the sources of the Einstein equations, is that the fluctuations of the energy momentum tensor remain small compared to its expectation value. We study the renormalization of both the energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x)\rangle_{\rm ren}$ and the fluctuation tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x) T_{cd}(x) \rangle_{\rm ren}$ for suitable Hadamard states, using the operator product expansion for a free scalar field on a fixed curved background. We show that squeezed vacua -- arising naturally in black hole evaporation and in inflationary cosmology -- fail to satisfy the semiclassicality criterion.

*Soma Heydari,Parastoo Askari,Kayoomars Karami*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a revised entropy formalism for apparent horizons in modified gravity, incorporating an extra integral term derived from modified Friedmann equations. This allows re-evaluating the Generalized Second Law (GSL) across cosmological models, showing improved validity for certain $f(T)$/$f(R)$ models at late times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding thermodynamic laws in modified gravity theories by providing a unified entropy framework for horizons in non-flat universes.

Method: Constructing horizon entropy from modified Friedmann equations in FRW cosmology, deriving a GSL expression, and testing on $f(T)/f(R)$ models across redshift.

Result: The integral term improves GSL validity for some models at late times, while leaving others unchanged, highlighting gravity-thermodynamics interplay.

Conclusion: The revised entropy formalism strengthens links between gravity and thermodynamics, offering a tool to test modified gravity models against thermodynamic consistency.

Abstract: This work presents a universal and revisited formalism for the entropy of the apparent horizon in modified gravity to investigate the validity of the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics. This revisited horizon entropy is constructed directly from the modified Friedmann equations in a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The resulting entropy relation contains, beside the standard Bekenstein-Hawking term, an additional integral contribution that encodes the effective energy density and pressure generated by deviations from general relativity. Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift. The analysis demonstrates that including the integral term in the revisited entropy can relatively improve the late-time validity of the GSL for some of these models while living others unchanged, thereby reinforcing the profound connection between thermodynamics and gravity.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how rotating black hole binaries with a companion can generate long-lived bosonic clouds through superradiant instabilities, using an effective field theory approach to model their dynamics. It identifies new orbital behaviors and inclinations affecting cloud depletion, eccentricity growth, and spin-orbit misalignment, offering observable signatures for future detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of companion black holes on the evolution of bosonic clouds and binary orbits, and to predict observable gravitational wave signatures of ultralight bosons.

Method: A worldline effective field theory framework for eccentric and inclined orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws.

Result: Discovered 'co-rotating' and 'counter-rotating' floating orbits that deplete boson clouds before entering detection bands, eccentricity growth toward fixed points, instability of equatorial orbits under certain mass ratios, and fixed points at intermediate inclinations. Derived flow equations for spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity.

Conclusion: The findings refine models of ultralight particle imprints on gravitational waves, providing clear observational signatures detectable by LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, advancing the study of dark matter candidates via gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: Superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes can give rise to long-lived bosonic clouds, offering natural laboratories to probe ultralight particles across a wide range of parameter space. The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.

### [24] [The Nature of Galactic Spiral Arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16966)
*Robert J. J. Grand,Martin Roth*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the importance of studying spiral arm pattern speeds in disc galaxies to resolve debates on their nature and evolutionary influence. It highlights the need for systematic observations using advanced spectrographs to analyze stellar kinematics and metallicities, which can validate or refute current spiral structure theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the nature and evolutionary role of spiral arms by analyzing their pattern speeds, which affect dynamical resonances and metallicity patterns, and to address the lack of observational data compared to existing theoretical models.

Method: Proposes a systematic observational program using wide-area multi-object spectrographs on large telescopes to map resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations in nearby galaxy spiral arms.

Result: Aims to provide observational data that can validate or challenge theoretical predictions from cosmological simulations regarding spiral structure dynamics and metallicity fluctuations.

Conclusion: Advances in observational technology are necessary to properly compare observations with simulations, ultimately clarifying the origin and impact of spiral arms in galaxy evolution.

Abstract: Spiral arms are the defining features of broad morphological classes of disc galaxies, but their nature and influence on galaxy evolution is still under debate. A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies.

Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.

Abstract: Ultracompact Galactic binaries with orbital periods below an hour are among the strongest persistent gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the mHz band and will constitute the dominant population detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Tens of thousands are predicted to be individually resolved, with a substantial fraction bright enough for electromagnetic (EM) follow-up. This opens an unprecedented multi-messenger window on compact binary evolution, tidal interactions, mass transfer, and the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. We highlight key science enabled by joint GW + EM constraints and emphasize the critical need for rapid, high-cadence spectroscopic capabilities in the 2040s. In particular, the most compact (<10 min) binaries detected by LISA will require read-noise-free, zero-dead-time spectroscopic facilities, potentially realized through coordinated arrays of telescopes with time-staggered exposures, to measure radial velocities, tidal heating signatures, and orbital evolution with the precision needed for transformative multi-messenger studies.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the unresolved progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae and proposes a new observational strategy using modular telescope arrays with advanced spectrographs to address current limitations in identifying and characterizing these systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Type Ia supernovae are crucial for cosmology and understanding galactic chemical evolution, but their progenitors' nature is still unknown. Existing surveys will discover many potential progenitors, but more advanced observational tools are needed to characterize them accurately.

Method: Proposing a modular, multi-aperture telescope array with fast, low-noise spectrographs to enable high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy. This setup allows flexible observing strategies for both faint and bright targets, providing continuous time series data without dead time.

Result: Such an observational system would enable determination of key parameters (masses, orbital inclinations, composition, accretion states) for compact binaries, resolving ambiguities in progenitor classifications and improving the use of SNe Ia as cosmological tools.

Conclusion: Next-generation surveys alone cannot solve progenitor puzzles; specialized telescope arrays with advanced spectroscopic capabilities are essential to advance our understanding of Type Ia supernova origins and properties.

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures. Such observations are difficult for single-aperture facilities.

*Justin Santana,Luke Heller,R. M. Buehrer*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: SatTrack is a GUI-driven simulation framework for predicting and mitigating transient high-power interference from LEO satellites at ground antennas using reconfigurable rim-based nulling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing number of LEO satellites like Starlink raises the risk of interference at ground receivers, necessitating scalable mitigation methods that maintain high throughput.

Method: SatTrack tracks satellite motion relative to an antenna's boresight, models parabolic reflector gain patterns with reconfigurable rim weights via physical optics, and employs optimization algorithms (greedy, simulated annealing) for creating nulls to suppress interference.

Result: Binary rim control reduces interference by 40-55 dB, while advanced methods achieve 65-70 dB suppression, with best-case interference under -220 dBm. Rim-based nulling matches satellite muting in suppression but maintains better throughput.

Conclusion: Rim-based reconfiguration is scalable and effective, though main lobe crossings remain a challenge, emphasizing the framework's utility for optimizing antenna interference mitigation.

Abstract: Large Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations (e.g., Starlink and Iridium) significantly increase the likelihood of transient, high-power interference events at ground receivers. This report presents SatTrack, a GUI-driven simulation framework that (i) tracks satellite motion relative to a fixed antenna boresight, (ii) predicts reflector gain patterns of a parabolic reflector antenna with a reconfigurable rim of specified size using a physical optics (PO) surface-current model decomposed into fixed and reconfigurable rim regions, and (iii) synthesizes deep, directional nulls using fast rim-weight optimization algorithms. Beyond baseline serial greedy and greedy bit-flip methods, additional files support advanced weight optimization algorithms including simulated annealing and majorization-minimization operating over higher-order complex weight alphabets, enabling deeper null formation. Interference power from satellites is estimated using free-space path loss and an FCC-derived Starlink EIRP versus steering-angle model, and event-level throughput for each satellite is computed using Shannon capacity. Results show simple binary rim control achieves about 40-55 dB of average interference suppression, while advanced optimization methods can exceed 65-70 dB under favorable geometries, with best-case received interference below -220 dBm. We compare no mitigation, satellite muting, and rim-based spatial nulling, showing rim-based nulling approaches muting-level suppression while preserving throughput close to the no-mitigation case. These results highlight both the scalability of rim-based reflector reconfiguration and the fundamental limitation when satellites cross the main lobe.

Motivation: To enhance the VLTI's ability to detect mature exoplanets in reflected light by optimizing its configuration.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need to understand mechanisms regulating star formation quenching in massive galaxies and presents the SHARP spectrograph concept for the ELT to study galaxy life-cycles through high-resolution observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify unresolved questions about the initiation and maintenance of star formation quenching, especially in the presence of gas reservoirs, and to better connect galaxy evolution with their surroundings (IGM/CGM). Current telescopes lack the resolution and sensitivity required for high-redshift studies.

Method: Proposing the SHARP spectrograph for the ELT, which combines multi-object slit and integral field spectroscopy in the near-IR. It aims to achieve 30 mas angular resolution, surpassing JWST's NIRSpec, to enable detailed analysis of galaxy evolution processes at unprecedented detail and distances.

Result: SHARP's capabilities will allow homogeneous study of star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching up to high redshifts, addressing key gaps in understanding galaxy life-cycles and their environmental dependencies.

Conclusion: The ELT equipped with SHARP represents a transformative tool for resolving the physical mechanisms behind galaxy quenching and evolution, providing critical insights into the interplay between galaxies and their cosmic environments.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the life-cycle of galaxies, particularly those of high mass, requires clarifying the mechanisms that regulate star formation (SF) and its abrupt shutdown (quenching), often capable of stopping SF rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. What initially triggers quenching, and what sustains the quiescent state thereafter, especially given the frequent presence of large gas reservoirs or even massive gas inflows, are unsolved key issues. Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions (~30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies.

Abstract: The unprecedented volume of data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescopes will require the implementation of robust and solid strategies for efficient data processing and management. In this context, the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) -- a collaborative global infrastructure comprising multiple regional centres distributed across various geographical regions around the globe -- is poised to play a critical role. This network will be instrumental in facilitating the effective handling and analysis of extensive data streams generated by the telescopes, thereby enabling significant advancements in astronomical research and exploration. This paper introduces a semantic model implemented with JSON-LD designed specifically for the SRCNet, detailing its architecture, data distribution, and computing service. By explicitly defining nodes, resources, relationships, and workflows, this model lays a foundation for interoperability and efficient resource management within the distributed network. The model presented in this text supports two possible configurations: centralized and decentralized -- depending where data reside -- enabling a future service broker to efficiently plan workflows by querying nodes for real-time system availability. Consistency tests conducted using SPARQL queries were made on the model in order to validate and test its integrity. Therefore, this research contributes to the advancement of semantic modeling in astronomy by addressing the semantic model for the SRCNet, a topic that has not been previously explored. This semantic model serves as a precursor to the development of a precise mathematical representation of the network and establishes a foundational framework for a future service broker.

TL;DR: The paper discusses Underluminous Thermonuclear Supernovae (uTSNe) as dimmer variants of Type Ia supernovae, suggesting they result from white dwarf deflagrations and linking them to low-mass binary star evolution. It identifies observational limitations: current telescopes lack high-resolution, wide-field imaging and rapid spectroscopic capabilities necessary for studying these transients, making it a suitable target for the Expanding Horizons program.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the observational challenges in detecting and studying uTSNe due to insufficient telescope capabilities, which hinder our understanding of their origins and relevance to cosmological studies.

Method: The paper likely reviews existing limitations in telescope technology and analyzes the requirements needed for effective uTSNe observation, arguing for the adoption of the Expanding Horizons program to fill this observational gap.

Result: Highlights the inadequacy of current instrumentation and advocates for advancements in high-spatial-resolution, wide-field imaging and rapid spectroscopic capabilities to better study uTSNe and their implications for cosmology.

Conclusion: The Expanding Horizons program is proposed as an ideal solution to overcome observational barriers, enabling breakthroughs in the study of uTSNe and their role in low-mass binary evolution and extragalactic cosmology.

Abstract: Underluminous Thermonuclear Supernovae (uTSNe) are an emerging class of transient events that resemble classic Supernovae Type Ia, but peak at much lower luminosities. Suspected to be the deflagrations of white dwarfs, they directly link the final stages of low-mass binary star evolution to extragalactic studies that are critical for cosmology. The ability to detect and study uTSNe is limited by the lack of high spatial resolution (<0.1"), wide-field (>10'x10') imaging capabilities in the optical, as well as large-scale segmented-telescope spectroscopic abilities that allow highly dynamic time-critical spectroscopy of short-duration transient events. Neither capability is currently foreseen for the European Southern Observatory and is therefore an excellent candidate for the Expanding Horizons program.

### [33] [Super-resolution-enabled atmospheric tomography for astronomical multi-wavefront-sensor adaptive-optics systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17430)
*Carlos M. Correia,Pierre Jouve,Jesse Cranney,Guido Agapito Cédric Taïssir Heritier*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper advances the use of super-resolution (SR) capabilities in astronomical adaptive optics (AO) tomography by developing a unified framework for linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) reconstructors. It demonstrates performance improvements through numerical simulations on 10m and 40m telescopes, highlighting computational efficiency and adaptability for both current and upcoming systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance classical AO tomography performance by leveraging super-resolution, unifying existing methods under a single framework, and enabling adaptive implementations for diverse telescope systems.

Method: The authors generalize tomographic reconstructors using a model-and-deploy approach, unify LMMSE solutions, adapt them via pseudo-open-loop control, review implementation forms (dense vs. sparse), and analyze computational efficiency through physical-optics simulations.

Result: Numerical simulations show SR-enabled reconstructors improve performance by tens of nm rms, with quantified computational costs for offline and real-time implementations.

Conclusion: SR-integrated LMMSE reconstructors offer significant performance gains for AO systems, paving the way for broad adoption across 10m to 40m-class telescopes. The framework supports efficient implementation strategies to manage computational demands.

Abstract: Recent work by Oberti et al, (Astron. Astrophys., 667, 48, 2022) argued and made a compelling case that classical astronomical adaptive optics (AO) tomography performance can be further enhanced by carefully designing and optically configuring the system to leverage inherent super-resolution (SR) capabilities. Our goal here is to further materialise the concept by providing the means to compute SR-enabling tomographic reconstructors for AO and showcase its broad uptake on soon every 10 m-class VIS/NIR telescopes and Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes of up to 40 m in diameter. To that end we indicate the necessary tomography generalisations where we: (i) clarify how model-and-deploy is a generic methodological umbrella for linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) tomographic reconstructors arising naturally from the solution of the tomographic inverse problem, thus unifying various solutions presented as distinct in the literature within a single framework, (ii) recall how such solutions are found as limiting cases of a model-based optimal control problem, thus elucidating how pseudo-open-loop control is a feature of the latter that allows LMMSE reconstructors to be adapted to closed-loop systems, (iii) review the two forms of the LMMSE tomographic reconstructors, highlighting the necessary adaptations to accommodate super-resolution, (iv) review the implementation in either dense-format vector-matrix-multiplication or sparse iterative forms and (v) discuss the implications for runtime and off-line real-time implementations, anticipating widespread adoption. We illustrate our examples with physical-optics numerical simulations for 10 m and 40 m-scale systems showing the performance benefits of super-resolution in the order of several tens of nm rms and the computational burden associated.

*Carlos M. Correia,Charlotte Z. Bond,João Aveiro,François Leroux,Cédric Taïssir Heritier,Christophe Vérinaud*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a super-resolution approach for pyramid wave-front sensors (PyWFS) using a single natural guide star, enabling spatial frequency reconstruction beyond the Shannon-Nyquist limit and measurement of amplitude aberrations, thus improving adaptive optics performance with manageable computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional SH-WFS in atmospheric tomography and explore superior performance of PyWFS with super-resolution capabilities to handle higher actuator density deformable mirrors despite fewer samples, while reducing sensitivity to misalignment.

Method: Revisits the analytic PyWFS diffraction model to demonstrate super-resolution in two ways: reconstructing spatial frequencies above the detector's Shannon-Nyquist limit and measuring amplitude aberrations causing scintillation. Uses computational methods to enhance resolution without increasing hardware complexity significantly.

Result: Super-resolved PyWFS shows resilience to mis-registration, relaxed alignment demands, better performance against aliasing/spurious modes, and requires only up to 2x real-time computational resources.

Conclusion: Super-resolution PyWFS offers a viable path to control denser deformable mirrors efficiently, improving adaptive optics systems with acceptable computational trade-offs.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) refers to a combination of optical design and signal processing techniques jointly employed to obtain reconstructed wave-fronts at a higher-resolution from multiple low-resolution samples, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of the latter. After compelling examples have been provided on multi-Shack-Hartman (SH) wave-front sensor (WFS) adaptive optics systems performing atmospheric tomography with laser guide star probes, we broaden the SR concept to pyramid sensors (PyWFS) with a single sensor and a natural guide star. We revisit the analytic PyWFS diffraction model to claim two aspects: i) that we can reconstruct spatial frequencies beyond the natural Shannon-Nyquist frequency imposed by the detector pixel size and/or ii) that the PyWFS can be used to measure amplitude aberrations (at the origin of scintillation). SR offers the possibility to control a higher actuator density deformable mirror from seemingly fewer samples, the quantification of which is one of the goals of this paper. A super-resolved PyWFS is more resilient to mis-registration, lifts alignment requirements and improves performance (against aliasing and other spurious modes AO systems are poorly sensitive to) with only a factor up to 2 increased real-time computational burden.

Abstract: The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) collaboration has acquired multiple passes of L-band (856-1712 MHz) scanning observations over a 268 deg$^2$ sky region. This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$>$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $μ$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid.

Abstract: Heterodyne interferometry for precision science often comes with an optical phase modulation, for example, for intersatellite clock noise transfer for gravitational wave (GW) detectors in space, exemplified by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The phase modulation potentially causes various noise couplings to the final phase extraction of heterodyne beatnotes by a phasemeter. In this paper, in the format of space-based GW detectors, we establish an analytical framework to systematically search for the coupling of various noises from the heterodyne and modulation frequency bands, which are relatively unexplored so far. In addition to the noise caused by the phase modulation, the high-frequency laser phase noise is also discussed in the same framework. The analytical result is also compared with a numerical experiment to confirm that our framework successfully captures the major noise couplings. We also demonstrate a use case of this study by taking the LISA-like parameters as an example, which enables us to derive requirements on the level of the laser and phase modulation noises in the high frequency regimes.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (GPPE) for modeling self-gravitating superfluid systems like boson/axion stars, dark-matter haloes, neutron stars, and pulsars. It integrates neutron superfluid vortices, proton-superconductor flux tubes, and electromagnetic effects into a coupled framework to explain pulsar glitches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding self-gravitating superfluid systems and their dynamics, particularly addressing phenomena like pulsar glitches through coupled electromagnetic and gravitational interactions.

Method: The GPPE is coupled with equations describing proton superconductors, Maxwell equations for vector potential A, and Poisson equation for self-gravity. This coupled model accounts for vortices in neutron superfluids and flux tubes in proton superconductors.

Result: Proposes a unified model that connects superfluid dynamics, electromagnetic behavior, and self-gravity to explain neutron star and pulsar phenomena, especially their glitches.

Conclusion: The coupled GPPE framework offers a promising approach for modeling complex astrophysical systems, providing insights into pulsar dynamics and gravitational interactions in dense matter environments.

Abstract: We provide an overview of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (GPPE) that is used to model self-gravitating superfluid systems, which include gravitationally collapsed boson and axion stars and dark-matter haloes. We outline how this framework can be used to develop minimal models for neutron stars and for pulsars and their glitches. We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity.

Abstract: HESS J1857+026 remains a mysterious gamma-ray emitter since its discovery in 2008. Despite the disclosure of a nearby pulsar and multiple studies in the high-energy (HE, E > 100 MeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) regimes, there have been no confirmed counterparts (e.g., an SNR shell or other extended structure) in X-ray or other wavelengths. We present the result of our study of the VHE emission of HESS~J1857+026 with VERITAS as part of a multi-wavelength investigation to uncover its emission mechanisms. Our result confirms the extended nature of the source and we characterize its spectral and morphological features in the VHE band. Using the morphology of the source revealed in our analysis, we also explore the underlying transport process of a possible electron population in a leptonic PWN scenario for the gamma-ray emission.

Abstract: We present constraints on the nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB) using X-ray pulsar timing data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer(\textit{NICER}). By analyzing six millisecond pulsars over a six-year observational baseline, we employed a Bayesian framework to model noise components and search for a common red signal consistent with a GWB from supermassive black hole binaries (assuming a spectral index $γ_{\rm gwb}=13/3$). Our results show no significant evidence for a GWB, yielding a 95\% upper limit of $\log_{10}(A_{\rm gwb})<-13.4$. Weak evidence for Hellings-Downs spatial correlations was found (S=2.5), though the signal remains statistically inconclusive. Compared to radio and $γ$-ray pulsar timing arrays, the \textit{NICER} constraint is currently less stringent but demonstrates the feasibility of X-ray timing with \textit{NICER} for GWB studies and highlights the potential for improved sensitivity with future X-ray missions.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Discovering radio signals from 1E 1207.4-5209, a young and dim radio pulsar, challenges prior assumptions about CCOs and suggests many young neutron stars may remain undetected due to low radio emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of radio detections from CCOs initially contradicted the standard pulsar model. Identifying radio signals from CCOs like 1E 1207.4-5209 aims to resolve this discrepancy and understand why some supernova remnants lack detectable pulsars.

Method: Observed polarization characteristics at the 0.4s X-ray period using radio telescopes to detect faint radio signals from CCO 1E 1207.4-5209. Analyzed how the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole.

Result: Confirmed that CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is a faint radio pulsar with intrinsic low radio emission, matching its X-ray period. The radio beam's magnetic pole proximity explains its faintness.

Conclusion: The discovery implies a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars undetectable by radio searches. CCOs and similar objects may erroneously appear as older pulsars when their supernova remnants disappear.

Abstract: The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars. Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.

TL;DR: Next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave observatories will significantly enhance our ability to detect compact-object mergers, enabling detailed studies of binary black hole populations across cosmic time, testing primordial black hole hypotheses, and shedding light on the early Universe and dark matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GW observatories have limitations in sensitivity and frequency range, restricting the comprehensive understanding of compact-object merger processes and their role in cosmic history.

Method: Next-generation detectors will improve sensitivity by an order of magnitude and access lower frequencies, allowing detection of BBH mergers up to z ≈ 100, enabling precise mass/spin distribution analysis and identification of primordial black holes via unique signals.

Result: Expected outcomes include mapping merger events across cosmic time, detecting thousands of high signal-to-noise ratio events, observing intermediate-mass BH systems, and potentially confirming primordial black holes as dark matter candidates.

Conclusion: Such advancements will revolutionize our knowledge of compact binary formation channels, the origin of supermassive black holes, and fundamental physics through unique GW signatures unobservable via electromagnetic means.

Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.

### [42] [On Signatures of a Possible New Physics Resonance in Atmospheric Air Showers Using a Parameterized Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17441)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a parameterized model of atmospheric particle showers from cosmic rays, comparing it to the Conex generator. It explores effects of hypothetical 100 GeV and 1 TeV resonances on shower profiles and maxima, showing dependence on resonance width and decay channels. The study suggests using 2D distributions of shower moments to detect new physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how hypothetical new physics resonances influence atmospheric particle showers, assess detectability through shower properties, and refine methods for identifying such phenomena in cosmic ray observations.

Method: A parameterized shower model is tuned against Conex data. Simulations incorporate resonances at 100 GeV and 1 TeV, analyzing their impact on shower depth, maxima, and profiles across different decay channels. Resonance widths and energy dependencies are studied, with proposals for 2D moment analysis.

Result: New resonance effects emerge near energy thresholds and last ~a decade in log-energy scale. Resonance width significantly affects visibility (10% width shows strong effects, diminishing at 1%). Decay channels alter shower depth direction and shape. 2D shower moment distributions offer promising signatures.

Conclusion: The model successfully isolates resonance impacts on showers. Future measurements should prioritize 2D moment analyses to detect new physics. Resonance width and decay mode selection are critical factors for observability.

Abstract: We present a parameterized model of atmospheric particle showers initiated by cosmic rays. Few physics shower parameters are tuned in a comparison to the Conex generator. Resulting shower properties are studied, with a comment on the cases where multiple shower maxima develop.
  Finally, we implement simple models of new physics resonance of masses of 100 GeV and 1 TeV and examine their effects on the shower profile, depth and maximum variation in dependence of the decay channel of the hypothetical resonance. It is shown that a new resonance effects can appear at the energy threshold and can persist for about a decade in $\log_{10} E/\mathrm{eV}$.
  Various assumed decay modes of the hypothetical resonance have different effects on the direction and shape of the modified average shower depth as function of the energy, with possible implications for current or future measurements. It is shown that, within the presented model, the visibility of the resonance in modified shower depth strongly depends on the resonance width. A significant modification at 10\% width gradually diminishes towards the percent-level width. We propose that looking at the 2D distributions of the two first individual shower moments can also reveal signatures of new physics.

Abstract: The advent of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and recent advances in reconstruction of gamma-ray photons with Cherenkov telescopes are bound to push the limit of angular resolution to an unprecedented precision of less than one arcminute at tens of TeV. Naturally, such instrumental improvements open up possibilities for new and interesting scientific studies. We aim to show that the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in particular is bound to profit from these high-resolution measurements. This is because PWNe are the dominant Galactic source population at TeV energies, exhibit hard spectra up to hundreds of TeV and from X-ray observations are known to possess plentiful structure on arcminute scales. Using HESS J1813-178 and MSH 15-52 as examples, we create simple leptonic models of the TeV morphology of these sources based on X-ray observations and existing gamma-ray measurements. Then, assuming different models for the exposure and point spread function of the observatory, we create mock observations with the future CTAO southern array. We use these to assess the ability of these observations to differentiate between models and study the physics of these sources, in particular to infer the structure of the magnetic field and electron distributions. We find that future observations with the CTAO southern array at multi-TeV energies - in combination with existing X-ray measurements - will likely be able to constrain the distributions of magnetic field and high-energy electrons in these sources. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of these measurements can be significantly enhanced with the improved angular resolution achievable with novel reconstruction algorithms. However, we also show that in the relevant multi-TeV regime, signal-photon statistics remain a limitation and trading event statistics for improved angular resolution is not necessarily advantageous.

### [44] [Radio studies of supernovae 1979C, 1986J and 2006X with LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17520)
*Peter Lundqvist,Deeepika Venkattu,Miguel Pérez Torres,Javier Moldón,Vijay Mahatma,Poonam Chandra*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes radio observations of three supernovae (SN 1979C, SN 1986J, and SN 2006X) using LOFAR data, providing constraints on circumstellar environments, progenitor masses, and ejecta structures, while challenging some existing theoretical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the long-term radio evolution of supernovae and their progenitor environments by leveraging high-sensitivity LOFAR observations. It seeks to test theoretical models and investigate features like circumstellar density, ejecta density profiles, and potential contributions from compact objects.

Method: The authors used LOFAR's LoTSS and ILT for radio observations at low frequencies. Radio emission models (e.g., CS15DD2 for SN2006X) were applied to interpret data. Spectral analysis, flux density measurements, and comparisons with X-ray data were conducted to model supernova evolution and progenitor properties.

Result: Key findings include upper limits on radio emission for SN2006X constraining circumstellar density, a steep flux decay in SN1979C suggesting progenitor mass ~13 solar masses and ejecta structure, and confirmation of spectral properties for SN1986J. Observations of SN1979C rule out central compact object emission scenarios.

Conclusion: LOFAR provides critical insights into supernova evolution over decades, enabling precise environmental and structural characterizations. The results emphasize the importance of continued long-term monitoring for resolving discrepancies between models and observations.

Abstract: We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) studies of supernovae SN 1979C, SN 1986J, and SN 2006X, focusing on new observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). For Type Ia SN 2006X, we derive a 3$σ$ upper limit of 0.7 mJy at 0.146 GHz, and using radio emission models based on the CS15DD2 explosion model, we constrain the circumstellar density to $n_{\rm H} \lesssim 10$ cm$^{-3}$ for the microphysical parameters $ε_{\rm rel} = ε_{\rm B} = 0.01$. SN 1979C is clearly detected in the LoTSS image with a flux density of $4.6 \pm 0.36$ mJy nearly 40 years postexplosion. Modeling its radio evolution suggests a steep flux decay ($F_ν \propto t^{-2.1}$) between 22 and 42 years, a break in the spectrum near 1.5 GHz possibly due to synchrotron cooling, a progenitor mass of $\sim 13$ solar masses, and a progressive steepening with velocity for the density slope of the supernova ejecta. Our findings for SN 1979C contradict scenarios involving central compact object emission, and we obtain X-ray temperatures close to those derived from recent observations. For SN 1986J, we present the first ILT image showing a flux density of $6.77\pm0.2$ mJy at 0.146 GHz. The spectral index of the shell emission is found to be $0.66\pm0.03$, consistent with previous estimates, although variations at low frequencies warrant further investigation. Our results highlight the power of LOFAR for studying long-term radio evolution in supernovae.

*A. Madathil-Pottayil,D. J. Walton,Jiachen Jiang,T. Dauser,Andrew Fabian,D. Stern,Luigi C. Gallo,Mark T. Reynolds,Emanuele Nardini,Javier A. Garcia*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of multi-epoch XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy PG 1535+547 reveals significant variability in its X-ray spectral properties over time. The study identifies variable neutral and ionized absorption, persistent reflection features, and a substantial flux decrease in 2016. The data suggest a rapidly spinning black hole (a>0.99) with intense light-bending effects contributing to observed flux changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex accretion disk and obscuration mechanisms in NLS1 galaxies through long-term X-ray spectral variability. Specifically, investigating how variable absorption, geometry, and black hole spin influence observed spectral changes and flux variations.

Method: Multi-epoch X-ray spectroscopy using XMM-Newton (2002, 2006) and combined XMM-Newton/NuSTAR (2016) observations across 0.3-60 keV. Analysis involved fitting X-ray spectra for absorption components (neutral/ionized), reflection features, and continuum properties. Simultaneous multi-epoch modeling to assess temporal changes and black hole spin inference.

Result: Observed spectral variability linked to variable line-of-sight absorption (neutral column density 0.3-5e23 cm-2) and intrinsic emission changes. The 2016 epoch shows a reflection-dominated state with R>7 and compact corona (≤1.72rg). Black hole spin estimated at a>0.99. Significant 2-10 keV flux drop (∼7×) in 2016 compared to 2006.

Conclusion: The detected variability arises from obscuring absorber layers and relativistic effects from a rapidly spinning black hole. These results highlight the dynamic interplay between accretion disk geometry, obscuration phases, and strong gravity effects in NLS1s, supporting light-bending as a key factor in flux variability.

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the 'complex' NLS1 PG 1535+547 at redshift $z=0.038$. These observations span three epochs: 2002 and 2006 with XMM-Newton alone, covering the $0.3-10$ keV energy range, and a coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation in 2016, covering the $0.3-60$ keV energy range. The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\sim0.3-5\times10^{23}\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($Γ\approx 2.2\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R>7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a>0.99$. These findings imply that strong light-bending effects may account for the observed continuum flux reduction.

TL;DR: The RNO-G shallow antennas' detection of cosmic rays aligns with expectations, confirming detector functionality and paving the way for future high-energy neutrino detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the early commissioning of the RNO-G detector by studying cosmic ray characteristics and backgrounds, ensuring readiness for detecting neutrinos above ~10 PeV.

Method: Analyzing cosmic ray data from shallow antennas, comparing observed signal shapes and particle properties (arrival direction, energy, polarization) with simulations, and addressing detector systematics.

Result: Detected cosmic ray counts, signal shapes, and reconstructed properties match expectations, with identified detector issues addressed to improve future performance.

Conclusion: The study confirms RNO-G's detector validity, addressing systemic challenges, and establishes a foundation for precise neutrino detection in subsequent phases.

Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is currently under construction with the aim to detect neutrinos with energies beyond $\sim 10\,\mathrm{PeV}$. A critical part of early detector commissioning is the study of detector characteristics and potential backgrounds, for which cosmic rays play a crucial role. In this article, we report that the number of cosmic rays detected with RNO-G's shallow antennas is consistent with expectations. We further verified the agreement in the observed cosmic-ray signal shape with expectations from simulations after careful treatment of the detector systematics. Finally, we find that the reconstructed arrival direction, energy, and polarization of the cosmic-ray candidates agrees with expectations. Throughout this study, we identified detector shortcomings that are mitigated going forward. Overall, the analysis presented here is an essential first step towards validating the detector and high-fidelity neutrino detection with RNO-G in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To precisely measure or constrain the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux from charmed meson decays, which affects interpretations of astrophysical neutrino signals and improves understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions.

Method: Combined analysis of cascade-like and track-like neutrino events in IceCube, accounting for systematic uncertainties from conventional and astrophysical neutrino flux models.

Result: Non-zero best-fit prompt flux result consistent with zero within 1σ uncertainty; upper limit set at 4×10^-16 (GeV m² s sr)^-1 at 10 TeV.

Conclusion: No significant detection of prompt flux, highlighting the need for improved models and future data to better constrain this background and enhance astrophysical neutrino studies.

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos for more than a decade. A relevant background to the astrophysical flux is prompt atmospheric neutrinos, originating from the decay of charmed mesons produced in cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production rate of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and consequently, the prompt neutrino flux, remains uncertain and has not yet been observed by neutrino detectors. An accurate measurement of this flux would enhance our understanding of fundamental particle physics such as hadronic interactions in high-energy cosmic-ray-induced air showers and the nucleon structure. Furthermore, an experimental characterization of this background flux will improve the precision of astrophysical neutrino flux spectral measurements. In this work, we perform a combined fit of cascade-like and track-like neutrino events in IceCube to constrain the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux. Given that the prompt flux is a sub-dominant contribution, treating systematic uncertainties arising from the potential mis-modeling of the conventional and astrophysical neutrino fluxes is critical for its measurement. Our analysis yields a non-zero best-fit result, which is, however, consistent with the null hypothesis of no prompt flux within one standard deviation. Consequently, we establish an upper bound on the flux at $4\times 10^{-16}$ (GeV m$^2$ s sr)$^{-1}$ at 10 TeV.

### [48] [Magnetic field spreading from stellar and galactic dynamos into the exterior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17770)
*Axel Brandenburg,Oindrila Ghosh,Franco Vazza,Andrii Neronov*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper challenges the common assumption that stellar and galactic dynamos' exteriors are best modeled as current-free potential fields, proposing instead that force-free fields are more accurate in diffusive spread scenarios. It finds that quadrupole fields can develop slowly decaying toroidal components and that magnetosphere expansion differs between dynamo growth and saturation phases. Observational signatures of dipole vs. quadrupole fields may be detectable, and galaxy magnetic field superpositions cannot explain void magnetization, pointing to primordial origins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current dynamo models which assume current-free or potential magnetic fields in exteriors. The authors aim to explore how diffusive spread in poorly conducting turbulent exteriors affects field decay and configurations, considering force-free fields as an alternative. This is motivated by the need for more accurate models predicting observational features like synchrotron emission and radio emissions, and understanding the origin of intergalactic void magnetization.

Method: Analytical analysis of magnetic field decay in spherical and oblate dynamo configurations under different phases (exponential growth vs. saturated). The study examines field component behavior (dipole, quadrupole) including toroidal components, their radial decay rates, magnetosphere expansion dynamics, and neglects Faraday displacement current. Synchrotron emission patterns and observational distinguishability are investigated.

Result: Quadrupole fields can have toroidal components decaying more slowly than dipoles under diffusive spread. Magnetospheres expand ballistically during dynamo growth (linear in time) but diffusively (t^1/2) during saturation. Faraday displacement current is negligible. Quadrupolar synchrotron emission forms constant intensity rings; dipole/quadrupole radio emissions show detectable radial trends. Superposed galaxy fields cannot magnetize voids, supporting primordial field origins.

Conclusion: Force-free field models better describe dynamo exteriors in diffusive environments. The modified decay behaviors and observational signatures suggest future radio telescope studies could test these configurations. The inability of galaxy field superpositions to explain void magnetization reinforces the primordial origin hypothesis for intergalactic magnetic fields.

Abstract: The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the resonant trident process in circularly polarized electromagnetic waves, focusing on energy dependencies, resonant conditions, quantum entanglement, and rate comparisons between resonant and non-resonant processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically explore the resonant trident process (Oleinik resonances) across various frequencies and intensities, understand its quantum characteristics, and evaluate its experimental and astrophysical relevance.

Method: The study uses theoretical analysis to derive analytical expressions for differential and full rates of the resonant trident process. It examines dependencies on electron energy, electromagnetic wave parameters (frequency, intensity), and angles between electron momentum and wave. Quantum entanglement of final particles is also addressed.

Result: The resonant process is effective when initial electron energy matches characteristic quantum energies (nonlinear Compton and Breit-Wheeler). Key findings include energy equality in electron-positron pairs, higher rates in optical/X-ray fields compared to non-resonant processes, and potential applications in experiments and astrophysical QED studies.

Conclusion: The results offer a foundation for experimental validation at advanced laser facilities and interpreting QED phenomena in extreme astrophysical environments like neutron stars/magnetars, emphasizing the process's significance in both laboratory and cosmic scales.

Abstract: The characteristic features of the resonant trident process (Oleinik resonances) have been theoretically studied in a wide range of frequencies and intensities of a circularly polarized strong electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is defined by two characteristic quantum energies: the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Compton effect and the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. These characteristic energies depend significantly on the frequency and intensity of the wave, as well as on the angle between the momenta of the initial electrons and the electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is effective when the energy of the initial electrons is greater than or on the order of magnitude of the corresponding characteristic energies. It is shown that quantum entanglement of final particles takes place in this resonant process. An important aspect of the resonant trident process is the equality of the energies of the electron and positron pairs. Analytical expressions for the differential rates of the resonant trident process on the energy of final particles are obtained. The corresponding analytical expressions for full rates have also been obtained. It is shown that the rate data of the resonant trident process in the field of optical and X-ray wave frequencies significantly exceed the corresponding rate of the non-resonant trident process. Results obtained can be used in experiments at leading laser centers, as well as to explain QED processes in strong X-ray fields near neutron stars and magnetars.

*Masayuki Note*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper identifies that operators involving the $\Box^2$ d'Alembertian uniquely cancel vacuum-energy divergences across all spin sectors in a Lorentz-invariant field theory, leading to a finite Higgs mass correction and suggesting a preferred scale of ~11.3 TeV to address the hierarchy problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the hierarchy problem by finding dimension-6 operators that universally remove vacuum-energy divergences ($\Lambda^4$ and $m^2\Lambda^2$ terms) without violating Lorentz invariance or hermiticity, while preserving gauge covariance.

Method: 1. Classify dimension-6 operators within local, Lorentz-invariant Hermitian theories. 2. Evaluate their ability to cancel power divergences in all spin sectors. 3. Derive modified propagators and compute one-loop vacuum integrals. 4. Apply the Real-Time Negative-Norm Prescription (RTNNP) to ensure consistent contour selection in HDLW (higher-derivative Lee-Wick) formalism.

Result: Only $\Box^2$-based operators consistently eliminate $\Lambda^4$ and $m^2\Lambda^2$ divergences. The HDLW structure with RTNNP yields a finite Higgs mass correction, predicting a preferred cutoff scale of ~11.3 TeV.

Conclusion: The HDLW framework with $\Box^2$ operators provides a predictive solution to the hierarchy problem, offering a valid UV completion that maintains theoretical consistency and gauge symmetry.

Abstract: Within the framework of local, Lorentz-invariant, and Hermitian field theories, we investigate the classification of dimension-6 operators that facilitate the dynamical cancellation of vacuum-energy divergences. We demonstrate that the operator class based on the $\Box^2$ d'Alembertian is uniquely singled out by the requirement of universal power-divergence subtraction across all spin sectors. By explicitly evaluating the modified propagators and one-loop vacuum integrals, we show that only this structure consistently removes $Λ^4$ and $m^2Λ^2$ terms while preserving gauge covariance. Adopting the Real-Time Negative-Norm Prescription (RTNNP) as a consistent contour selection, we find that the higher-derivative Lee--Wick (HDLW) structure leads to a finite, calculable Higgs mass correction. Our results suggest a phenomenologically preferred scale of $M \approx 11.3$ TeV, offering a predictive and structurally motivated resolution to the hierarchy problem.

Abstract: We study the cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) of spin-3/2 particles during and after cosmic inflation, and map the parameter space that can realize the observed dark matter density in stable spin-3/2 particles. Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism.

While the SM prediction requires further improvements by a factor of four to fully leverage the sensitivity achieved in experiment, the FNAL measurement will set the standard for many years to come, and we discuss a variety of features of the experimental campaign that made this achievement possible. In going forward, we discuss current efforts to improve the SM prediction, and imagine how an experiment would have to be devised to surpass 124 ppb in precision.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The bright ring-like structures observed in the images of M87* and SgrA* captured by the Event Horizon Telescope strongly support the validity of general relativity. Lensed images of the emission region, often referred to as photon rings in this context, are a direct consequence of the unstable dynamics of null geodesics near the spherical photon orbit in the Kerr spacetime. The order of the lensed image can be characterized by the number of half-orbits the photons complete before reaching the observer, with higher-order photon rings produced by null geodesics that circle the black hole more times. However, low-order rings are significantly influenced by the astrophysical environment. Measuring the Lyapunov exponent requires probing the exponentially small differences between successive photon rings or between photon rings and the shadow. We investigate potential astrophysical sources of systematic error the estimation of Lyapunov exponent, including the location of the observed emission, and especially at low photon ring order. We show that it is nevertheless possible to measure this purely gravitational quantity to roughly 10% and 1% systematic uncertainty by resolving the n=2 and n=3 photon rings with the shadow size, respectively. Therefore, the forthcoming black hole imaging efforts to capture, even if indirectly, the n=2 photon ring can result in a measurement of the Lyapunov exponent that is not limited by astrophysical uncertainties.

Motivation: To recover the angular momentum information lost in traditional inclusive measurements and create observables less affected by infrared dynamics, thereby better probing the hard interactions in scattering processes.

Method: Developed a framework using spinning energy correlators that encode both source and detector angular momentum structures. Applied unitarity and energy positivity constraints to bound these correlators, demonstrated calculations in QCD and energy-charge correlators.

Result: Established that spinning correlators are confined within a bounded region determined by extremal cases of pure spin states. Showed their reduced infrared sensitivity and derived generalized sum rules applicable to conserved charges beyond energy.

Conclusion: Spinning energy correlators provide a powerful new toolset for high-energy physics, enabling direct access to hard scattering dynamics through observables that are robust against infrared effects and encode rich angular momentum information.

Abstract: The $N$-point energy correlator measures the energy flux through $N$ detectors. We present a general framework that characterizes its full angular dependence in a series of \textit{spinning energy correlators}. These spinning correlators resurrect the angular momentum structure of both the source and the detector configuration, lost otherwise in inclusive measurements. We demonstrate that unitarity and energy positivity confine these correlators to a sharply bounded region, with the boundary realized by extremal correlators generated by pure spin states. We present a first calculation of spinning energy correlators in QCD as well as spinning energy-charge correlators. Their enhanced insensitivity to infrared dynamics opens up a new set of observables that directly probe the hard part of the scattering. Finally, we provide generalized sum rules, extended to spinning correlators and to conserved charges beyond energy.

### [56] [Fermion Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma (with Applications to Neutron Stars)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16993)
*Alberto Salvio*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper extends thermal field theory to include fermions with arbitrary equilibrium conditions, including angular momentum, and applies it to neutron stars, showing rotation increases neutrino production rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize previous studies on scalar fields to fermion-scalar theories, addressing arbitrary thermal conditions and angular momentum effects in dense systems like neutron stars.

Method: Developed path-integral techniques for thermal Green's functions in interacting fermion-scalar theories, covering real and imaginary-time formalisms. Applied these to calculate physical quantities in rotating neutron star contexts.

Result: Demonstrated that neutrino production via direct URCA processes increases indefinitely as neutron star rotation approaches inverse plasma size limits. Derived expressions for Fermi surface, energy density, and angular momentum under rotation.

Conclusion: Rotation significantly enhances neutrino emission in neutron stars through direct URCA processes, highlighting the importance of incorporating angular momentum in thermal field theory models for astrophysical applications.

Abstract: This paper provides a systematic and complete study of thermal field theory with fermion fields of any kind for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also average angular momentum. This extends a previous study that focused on scalar fields, to all fermion-scalar theories. Both Dirac and Majorana fermions and both Dirac and Majorana masses are covered. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic interacting fermion-scalar theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. These general results are applied to physical situations typical of neutron stars, which are often quickly rotating: the Fermi surface and Fermi momentum, the average energy, number density and angular momentum for degenerate fermions and particle production (such as neutrino production from rotating neutron stars, e.g. pulsars). In particular, it is shown that the neutrino production rate due to the direct URCA (DU) processes grows indefinitely as the angular velocity approaches the inverse linear size of the plasma and, therefore, rotation can significantly increase this rate.

*Patrick D. Bolton,Jernej F. Kamenik,Martín Novoa-Brunet*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an extension of the Standard Model with a U(1)' gauge symmetry to explain the Belle II anomaly, introducing a light Z' vector boson and a vector-like top partner, while addressing LHCb constraints through an additional singlet fermion for invisible decays and dark matter genesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the excess in Belle II's $B^+ 	o K^+ E_{m miss}$ data attributed to a light invisible particle (~2.1 GeV) and reconcile with LHCb's dimuon resonance exclusions while accommodating dark matter abundance.

Method: Constructed a UV-complete Higgsed U(1)' model with Z' and vector-like top partner to enhance $b 	o s$ transitions. Introduced a singlet fermion to suppress lepton couplings, enabling dominant invisible Z' decays and evading collider constraints. Calculated resonance freeze-out for dark matter.

Result: The extended model successfully accounts for Belle II's anomaly, avoids LHCb dimuon limits, and naturally produces observed dark matter density via Z' thermal freeze-out without conflicting with Higgs or dark photon results.

Conclusion: This minimal U(1)' extension with an extra singlet fermion provides a comprehensive solution to the Belle II excess and dark matter puzzle, remaining viable under current experimental constraints.

Abstract: Recent Belle II data on $B^+ \to K^+ E_{\rm miss}$ show an excess consistent with a two-body decay involving a light invisible particle with mass around $2.1\,\mathrm{GeV}$. We present a UV-complete explanation based on a Higgsed $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry with a light vector boson $Z'$ and a vector-like top partner, which naturally enhances $b \to s$ transitions. While the minimal model can reproduce the required $B \to K^{(*)} Z'$ rate, it is excluded by LHCb searches for resonant dimuon decays due to unavoidable loop-induced couplings of $Z'$ to charged leptons. We show that a minimal extension with an additional light $U(1)'$-charged singlet fermion allows $Z'$ to decay dominantly invisibly, evades existing constraints coming also from dark photon and collider searches as well as Higgs measurements, and can simultaneously account for the Belle II excess and the observed dark matter abundance through resonant thermal freeze-out.

### [58] [Intrinsic Properties of Large CP Violation in the Complex Two-Higgs-Doublet Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17002)
*Soojin Lee,A. Hammad,Dongjoo Kim,Jeonghyeon Song*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores CP violation in the Complex Two-Higgs-Doublet Model, showing distinct pathways in Type-I and Type-II models, with hidden CP violation in Higgs alignment limits detectable via specific interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify regions of large CP violation in the model under experimental and theoretical constraints, particularly addressing electron EDM bounds and collider data.

Method: Comprehensive global scan of Type-I and Type-II models considering theoretical requirements and constraints like eEDM. Analyze CP mixing in gauge vs. Yukawa sectors, and decoupling effects in Higgs alignment.

Result: Type-I requires minimal eEDM exceeding 1e-31 e·cm; gauge CP violation tied to Higgs degeneracy. Type-II suppresses gauge CP violation but allows Yukawa-sector maxima with eEDM correlation. 'Hidden CP violation' found when heavy scalars decouple from gauge bosons but retain CP mixing.

Conclusion: The scenarios offer testable predictions for next-gen EDM experiments and collider searches, highlighting hidden CP violation as a novel probeable phenomenon.

Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic properties of the parameter space capable of supporting large CP violation in the Complex Two-Higgs-Doublet Model with softly broken $Z_{2}$ symmetry, hosting three CP-mixed neutral Higgs mass eigenstates. Using a comprehensive global scan of Type-I and Type-II models -- incorporating all relevant theoretical requirements and collider constraints together with the stringent electron EDM (eEDM) bound -- we identify distinct phenomenological pathways to regions of large CP violation. In Type-I, we find that all viable parameter points predict a strict lower bound on the eEDM, $|d_e| > 10^{-31}\,e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$, placing this scenario within definitive reach of next-generation EDM experiments; moreover, sizable CP violation in the gauge sector emerges only when the 125~GeV state is nearly degenerate with a second neutral Higgs boson. In contrast, Type-II suppresses gauge-sector CP violation but allows maximal CP mixing in the Yukawa sector of the heavy neutral scalars, exhibiting a strong correlation between large fermionic CP violation and the predicted eEDM. Finally, we uncover a phenomenon of ``hidden CP violation'' in the Higgs alignment limit: even as the heavy neutral scalars decouple from gauge bosons, their CP mixing remains entirely unconstrained and becomes increasingly maximal as the Yukawa-sector CP violation increases. We show that this hidden CP violation can be directly probed through the non-vanishing cubic interactions of the heavy neutral scalars to the charged Higgs and $W$ bosons.

Abstract: Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions provide a unique window into far-from-equilibrium states of QCD matter. The initial stages of these events are characterized by highly anisotropic, nonthermal dynamics that precede hydrodynamization, yet they remain largely inaccessible through conventional soft observables. In this work, we show that the substructure of mid-rapidity jets provides direct sensitivity to the spacetime structure of this early, anisotropic phase. Using classical Yang-Mills simulations and effective kinetic theory to model the early-time evolution of the jet quenching parameter, we compute the azimuthally differential energy-energy correlator within the BDMPS-Z framework. By decomposing the result into celestial blocks, we isolate the coefficients that encode the anisotropic geometry and dynamics of the underlying medium. We identify an observable that couples directly to spatial anisotropies in the out-of-equilibrium QCD matter and also discuss the impact of medium response on its behavior. We further extend our study to mid-rapidity jets generated with the JEWEL Monte-Carlo, adjusted to incorporate an anisotropic medium background, and find qualitative agreement with the analytical expectations. Finally, we discuss how higher-point energy correlators and generalized energy-flow operators can enhance the sensitivity to the microscopic structure of far-from-equilibrium QCD matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of large transformer models in jet tagging by reducing parameters and quantizing models without significant accuracy drop.

Method: Developing a slimmed L-GATr architecture and comparing quantization techniques for standard and Lorentz-equivariant transformers to assess resource efficiency.

Result: Achieved six-fold reduction in energy cost with a moderate performance decrease; demonstrated feasibility of 1000-parameter taggers for potential use in real-time LHC triggers.

Conclusion: Quantized, small transformers offer a promising path to practical, energy-efficient jet tagging at trigger level, balancing computational resources and performance.

Abstract: Modern machine learning is transforming jet tagging at the LHC, but the leading transformer architectures are large, not particularly fast, and training-intensive. We present a slim version of the L-GATr tagger, reduce the number of parameters of jet-tagging transformers, and quantize them. We compare different quantization methods for standard and Lorentz-equivariant transformers and estimate their gains in resource efficiency. We find a six-fold reduction in energy cost for an moderate performance decrease, down to 1000-parameter taggers. This might be a step towards trigger-level jet tagging with small and quantized versions of the leading equivariant transformer architectures.

TL;DR: The paper explores enhanced sensitivities to Lorentz violation in existing experiments by incorporating boost-suppressed effects, revealing new signals at both standard sidereal frequencies and unconventional frequencies through the analysis of boost transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the detection of Lorentz violation by accounting for previously overlooked boost-suppressed effects which can manifest as observable variations at multiple frequencies, thereby enhancing experimental sensitivity without needing new setups.

Method: Analytical examination of Lorentz-violating signals generated via boost transformations, focusing on how additional terms in these transformations introduce novel frequency components in experimental observables. Specific examples are provided to demonstrate the emergence of these signals.

Result: Identification of new signal frequencies beyond the commonly-analyzed sidereal frequency, showing that boost-suppressed terms contribute significantly to observable variations. Examples illustrate the method's effectiveness in detecting Lorentz violation.

Conclusion: Incorporating boost-suppressed effects in experimental analyses can uncover previously undetected Lorentz-violating signals, urging re-evaluation of existing experimental data and future designs to include multi-frequency studies for enhanced sensitivity.

Abstract: Additional sensitivities to Lorentz violation can be obtained from existing experiments by considering additional boost-suppressed effects. The additional Lorentz-violating signals arise as variations in experimental observables at the commonly-used sidereal frequency as well as more novel frequencies. In this work we provide some examples that serve to illustrate how interesting signals arise from the structure of the relevant boost transformations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes conformal prediction (CP) as a standard calibration method for machine learning models in collider physics, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification with finite-sample guarantees across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in collider research lack reliable uncertainty estimates and finite-sample guarantees, hindering their use in statistical inference. CP addresses this by offering a distribution-free calibration without retraining, ensuring valid uncertainty quantification.

Method: The authors apply CP as a unified calibration layer to diverse models and datasets in collider physics. They test it across regression, classification, anomaly detection, and generative modeling, converting model outputs into validated prediction sets, regions, and p-values with controlled error rates.

Result: CP successfully provides statistically valid uncertainty estimates across all tasks without sacrificing model performance. It ensures honest uncertainty quantification and transparent error control, proving its versatility in collider physics applications.

Conclusion: Adopting CP as a standard component in ML pipelines for collider physics enhances reliability, enables robust statistical decisions, and supports accurate comparisons and interpretations in experimental analyses.

Abstract: Machine-learning techniques are essential in modern collider research, yet their probabilistic outputs often lack calibrated uncertainty estimates and finite-sample guarantees, limiting their direct use in statistical inference and decision-making. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a simple, distribution-free framework for calibrating arbitrary predictive models without retraining, yielding rigorous uncertainty quantification with finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal exchangeability assumptions, without reliance on asymptotics, limit theorems, or Gaussian approximations. In this work, we investigate CP as a unifying calibration layer for machine-learning applications in high-energy physics. Using publicly available collider datasets and a diverse set of models, we show that a single conformal formalism can be applied across regression, binary and multi-class classification, anomaly detection, and generative modelling, converting raw model outputs into statistically valid prediction sets, typicality regions, and p-values with controlled false-positive rates. While conformal prediction does not improve raw model performance, it enforces honest uncertainty quantification and transparent error control. We argue that conformal calibration should be adopted as a standard component of machine-learning pipelines in collider physics, enabling reliable interpretation, robust comparisons, and principled statistical decisions in experimental and phenomenological analyses.

*Antonio De Felice,Takehiro Ogura,Shinji Tsujikawa,Kimiko Yamashita*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines dark photon dark matter within a dark U(1)_X symmetry, using a Z_2 parity to avoid kinetic mixing with the Standard Model. It explores Higgs-portal interactions and Stueckelberg mechanism for mass generation, analyzing freeze-in production via Higgs-pair annihilations. Results show viable parameter spaces for dark matter relic density, with Stueckelberg effects becoming significant only when Wilson coefficients of dimension-6 operators are sub-unity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study dark photon dark matter while evading experimental constraints from kinetic mixing, investigate relic density via Higgs-portal interactions, and understand the role of Stueckelberg-induced terms in freeze-in production.

Method: The analysis uses dimension-6 gauge-invariant Higgs-portal operators (parity-even and parity-odd), Stueckelberg mechanism for mass generation, and examines freeze-in production from post-reheating Higgs-pair annihilations. Two scenarios are considered: Wilson coefficients (C, \tilde{C}) of order unity vs sub-unity.

Result: When Wilson coefficients are O(1), Stueckelberg contributions remain subdominant due to unitarity cutoff constraints. For smaller coefficients, Stueckelberg terms become comparable, introducing interference effects. Both cases allow parameter regions consistent with observed relic density.

Conclusion: The model provides a viable framework for thermal-insensitive dark matter via freeze-in, with Stueckelberg effects modulating production efficiency depending on operator coefficients. This opens distinct observational signatures in particle physics experiments.

Abstract: We study dark photon dark matter $X$ associated with a dark $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. To evade laboratory and cosmological constraints on kinetic mixing with the Standard Model $U(1)_Y$, we assign a $Z_2$-odd dark parity to $X$ that forbids such mixing. The leading interactions then arise from gauge-invariant dimension-6 Higgs-portal operators, including both parity-even and parity-odd terms. We assume that the dark matter mass is generated via the Stueckelberg mechanism, which also induces a dimension-4 Higgs-portal operator $(H^\dagger H) X_μX^μ$ and additional dimension-6 operators. We investigate freeze-in production of $X$ from Higgs-pair annihilations after reheating, incorporating both gauge-invariant and Stueckelberg-induced operators. First, we consider the case in which the Wilson coefficients of the gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators, $C$ and $\tilde{C}$, are of order unity. We find that, in this case, the Stueckelberg contributions remain subdominant in dark matter production. This result follows from the requirement that the effective scale implied by perturbative unitarity must exceed the cutoff scale of the effective field theory. Next, we explore a more general situation in which $C$ and $\tilde{C}$ are smaller than unity. In this second case, Stueckelberg-induced operators can become comparable and lead to distinctive features in the dark-matter parameter space, including interference effects. For both cases, we show that there exists a wide parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the necessity of including quantum corrections in studies of neutrino mass parameters within the Zee model by evaluating their magnitude through effective field theory methods.

Method: 1-loop matching conditions combined with renormalisation group equations in the two Higgs doublet model were used to compute quantum corrections to neutrino mass squared differences, mixing angles, and phases across four benchmark scenarios.

Result: Quantum corrections significantly affect neutrino parameters in specific scenarios, necessitating their inclusion in Zee model analyses to ensure accurate predictions.

Conclusion: Quantum effects cannot be universally neglected in Zee model studies; their consideration depends on model parameters, particularly in cases with large Yukawa couplings or heavy scalar masses.

Abstract: We analyse the size of quantum corrections in the Zee model using effective field theory techniques. We derive the relevant 1-loop matching conditions and use them together with the existing renormalisation group equations in the two Higgs doublet model to calculate quantum corrections to the neutrino mass squared differences, mixing angles, and phases. Using four benchmark scenarios, we demonstrate when quantum corrections have to be included in studies of neutrino mass parameters in the Zee model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel quantum sensing method using an organic molecular maser to detect axion-electron interactions at an axion mass of ~6 μEV, achieving a coupling sensitivity of 8×10^-6 GeV^-1 and magnetic field sensitivity of 0.85 fT/√Hz. This approach expands quantum-enhanced detection capabilities for dark matter searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laboratory searches for axion-electron interactions near 6 μEV are limited, and existing experiments lack sufficient sensitivity. The study aims to fill this gap by demonstrating a more sensitive detection method to explore uncharted parameter space in dark matter research.

Method: The method employs an organic molecular maser-based quantum sensing technique. It leverages coherent manipulation of molecular spins to detect tiny magnetic field fluctuations induced by axion-electron interactions, enabling high-sensitivity measurements in the sub-μEV mass range.

Result: The experiment achieved a coupling sensitivity of 8×10^-6 GeV^-1 and magnetic field sensitivity of 0.85 fT/√Hz. This represents a significant improvement over previous approaches in the target mass region and validates the method's feasibility as a proof-of-principle.

Conclusion: The demonstrated technique opens new avenues for quantum-enhanced dark matter detection. Its generic nature allows extension to other systems, promising broader applications in both quantum sensing and fundamental physics explorations.

Abstract: We present a novel quantum sensing approach to search for axion-electron interactions around the axion mass of 6 \mueV. In this region, laboratory searches are relatively scarce, and our direct experiment measuring the axion-electron coupling constant reaches the sensitivity of 8 \times 10^{-6} GeV^{-1}. The method, based on an organic molecular maser establishes a proof-of-principle for quantum-enhanced detection, with a corresponding magnetic field sensitivity of 0.85 fT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}. The methodology is generic and can be readily extended to other physical systems, further broadening its applicability in quantum sensing and dark matter searches.

Abstract: We calculate all three-loop, five-point, massless planar Feynman integral families in the dimensional regularization scheme. This is a new milestone in Feynman integral computations.

Abstract: One of the main goals of the ongoing LHC program is the search for BSM physics, with EW SUSY partners still allowed with masses as low as a few hundred GeV. Over the last years, searches for the ``golden channel'', $pp \to \tildeχ^0_2 \tildeχ^\pm_1 \to \tildeχ^0_1 Z^{(*)} \, \tildeχ^0_1 W^{\pm (*)}$ show consistent excesses between CMS and ATLAS in the 2 soft-lepton and 3 soft-lepton plus missing $E_T$ searches, favoring mass scales of $m_{\tildeχ^0_2} \approx m_{\tildeχ^{\pm}_1} \ge 200$ GeV and $Δm_{21} := m_{\tildeχ^0_2} - m_{\tildeχ^0_1} \approx 20$ GeV. We analyze these excesses in the framework of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). We assume a singlino dominated lighest neutralino, $\tildeχ^0_1$, as our Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The second and third lightest neutralinos, $\tildeχ^0_{2,3}$ are higgsino like, with the higgsino mixing parameter $μ$ being smaller than the soft SUSY-breaking bino and wino masses, $M_1$ and $M_2$. In particular, we assume the approximate GUT relations $M_1 \sim M_2/2 \sim M_3/6$, yielding a gluino mass $m_{\tilde g} \sim M_3 \ge 2$ TeV, in agreement with the LHC search limits. The scalar masses are assumed to heavy and do not play a role in our analysis. We demonstrate that this scenario is in agreement with all relevant experimental constraints, comprising the DM direct detection limits and the upper limit on the DM relic density, the LHC searches for SUSY particles and additional Higgs bosons, as well as the LHC Higgs-boson rate measurements. This constitutes the first explanation of the soft-lepton excesses in a model with GUT relations among the soft SUSY-breaking parameters.

Motivation: To accurately model heavy quark-initiated jets in QCD by including mass effects and resumming logarithmic corrections, which are crucial for precise predictions in high-energy collider physics.

Method: Quasi-collinear factorisation, variable flavour-number scheme, numerical resummation of soft logarithms while preserving mass dependence, matched to tree-level matrix elements for phenomenology in e+e- collisions.

Result: Presented the first resummed calculation of Lund plane density in e+e- collisions at M_Z, showing improved accuracy by including mass effects and higher-order logarithmic terms.

Conclusion: The approach enhances precision in jet substructure analyses and provides a framework for future studies involving heavy quark-initiated jets in collider experiments.

Abstract: We compute the primary Lund plane density for jets initiated by a massive ($b$) quark to single logarithmic accuracy in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In order to capture mass effects, we consider quasi-collinear factorisation and we include contributions from the running of the QCD coupling and from collinear evolution, in a variable flavour-number scheme. Furthermore, the resummation of soft logarithms, including clustering effects, is performed numerically, keeping the full dependence on the $b$-quark mass. While our all-order results can be applied to both hadron and lepton colliders, we present, as first phenomenological application, the resummed calculation of the Lund plane density in $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=M_Z$, matched to tree-level matrix elements.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that a coherent shift in the chiral condensate's vacuum expectation value during heavy-ion collisions leads to observable effects in pion spectra, supporting partial chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the chiral symmetry restoration mechanism at high temperatures can be experimentally verified through pion momentum spectra in heavy-ion collisions.

Method: Theoretical analysis of deviation in the chiral condensate field on the freeze-out hypersurface, simulating its effect on charged pion transverse momentum spectra post-resonance decay.

Result: The predicted spectral contributions match experimental data from RHIC and LHC, indicating validity of the chiral condensation mechanism.

Conclusion: Experimental observations align with the theoretical model, providing strong evidence for partial chiral symmetry restoration via condensate dynamics at extreme temperatures.

Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics with light quarks features an approximate global symmetry, known as chiral symmetry, that is believed to be spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of a scalar and isoscalar composite field, in addition to a small explicit breaking due to finite quark masses. For a high enough temperature, as achieved in the early universe or the fireball created by a high-energy heavy ion collision, this symmetry is expected to be restored. We show theoretically that a coherent deviation of the corresponding quantum field from its usual vacuum expectation value on the freeze-out hypersurface of a heavy-ion collision leads, after resonance decays, to a characteristic contribution to the transverse momentum spectrum of charged pions, in the very soft regime, consistent with experimental data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. Taken together, the experimental data with the new theoretical results provide compelling support for the existence of a chiral condensation mechanism with partial restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperature.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We revisit the flavor composition of neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae (SN), focusing on robust predictions that are insensitive to the poorly known dynamics of collective flavor conversion in the inner core. Assuming that the many different trajectories and microscopic histories of neutrinos lead to decoherence of the ensemble at the boundary between the region of collective effects and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) dominated layers, we show that standard matter effects alone strongly constrain the electron-flavor fraction at Earth. For normal mass ordering (NO) we obtain $f_{ν_e}^{\rm NO}\lesssim 0.5$ at all times and energies, while for inverted ordering (IO), we predict $f_{ν_e}^{\rm IO}\simeq 1/3$, i.e.\ near flavor equipartition. Shock-wave propagation through the high (H) MSW resonance drives the system toward equipartition also in NO. In this way our framework links simple assumptions about decoherence and standard matter effects to robust expectations for the flavor evolution inside core-collapse supernovae. This contribution summarizes the main results of arXiv:2403.14762.

### [73] [A Comprehensive holographic Study of Proton Structure: From Spectroscopy and Form Factors to the $γp\rightarrow J/ψp$ Scattering Cross Section](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17554)
*Jiali Deng,Defu Hou*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses a holographic soft wall model to compute proton properties like mass spectrum, electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, and mechanical properties, achieving agreement with experimental data and lattice QCD, and predicts a photoproduction cross-section.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified framework for describing diverse proton observables and linking them to scattering processes by using a holographic approach.

Method: Employ the soft wall model incorporating gluon condensation and linear confinement to compute proton mass spectrum, EMFFs, GFFs, radii, and mechanical properties (pressure, shear force). Use GFFs to calculate γp→J/ψp cross-section.

Result: Results align with experimental data and lattice QCD for proton properties. Predicted photoproduction cross-section matches experiments.

Conclusion: The soft wall model consistently describes proton structure and connects it to scattering processes, offering a unified framework in hadronic physics.

Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of the proton-including its mass spectrum, electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, and mechanical properties-remains a central challenge in hadronic physics. While lattice QCD and experimental measurements provide valuable insights, a unified holographic framework capable of simultaneously describing these diverse observables and connecting them to measurable scattering processes is still lacking. Here, we employ the soft wall model, a holographic approach that incorporates gluon condensation and linear confinement, to systematically compute the proton mass spectrum, electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs), and gravitational form factors (GFFs). Our results show good agreement with recent experimental data and lattice QCD calculations. We further derive the corresponding proton radii and mechanical properties, such as pressure and shear force distributions. Finally, using the obtained GFFs as input, we calculate the cross-section for the photoproduction process $γp\rightarrow J/ψp$. Our calculations demonstrate that the soft wall model consistently reproduces key proton structure observables and predicts a scattering cross-section in agreement with experimental measurements.

### [74] [How much color do we really need? Two-loop subleading-color effects in photon and jet physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17591)
*Michał Czakon,Rene Poncelet*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of subleading-color contributions on LHC processes with three resolved final states (photons/jets) at next-to-next-to-leading order QCD. It finds these contributions are generally below 2%, except in three- to two-jet cross-section ratios (~5%), and confirms results hold for common renormalization schemes. The effects are smaller than uncertainties from perturbation truncation, relevant for extracting the strong coupling constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the reliability of prior calculations using the leading-color approximation by quantifying subleading-color effects in three-body LHC processes, crucial for precision measurements like the strong coupling constant extraction.

Method: Recomputed cross sections using exact two-loop amplitudes (without leading-color approximation), compared with previous leading-color results. Analyzed effects across different infrared renormalization schemes (min subtraction vs Catani's).

Result: Subleading-color effects are within 2% for most observables except the three-to-two-jet ratio (5%). Effects are consistently smaller than truncation uncertainties (~10% for three-jet cross-sections).

Conclusion: Leading-color approximation is valid for most LHC observables at current precision levels. However, three-jet ratio measurements require full amplitudes to minimize systematic errors in α_s extraction. Perturbation uncertainty dominates over color-correction effects.

Abstract: In recent years, the complete set of cross sections for Large Hadron Collider (LHC) processes ending with three resolved final states consisting of either photons or jets has been evaluated at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD and leading order in QED. Results for three photons or three jets have only been obtained using the leading-color approximation of the virtual two-loop amplitudes. In the meantime, the required amplitudes have become available without recourse to the color expansion. In the present publication, we quantify the effects of the subleading-color contributions, and show that they do not exceed 2\% for most of the previously published results. The one exception is the ratio of three- to two-jet cross sections, where subleading-color effects can reach up to 5\%. Furthermore, we show that these conclusions hold for both popular infrared renormalization schemes, minimal subtraction and Catani's. The size of the effects is usually overshadowed by the size of the remaining uncertainty due to the truncation of the perturbation series. This is particularly important in the case of three-jet distributions that have already been used for the extraction of the strong-coupling constant at the very high energies available at the LHC.

### [75] [Only slightly "Amplifying nonresonant production of dark sector particles in scattering dominance regime''](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17652)
*S. V. Demidov,D. S. Gorbunov,A. L. Polonski*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper challenges previous findings that dark photon production in nuclear reactors is enhanced by a factor of 10 via Compton scattering. Through GEANT simulations accounting for photon oscillations and interactions, the study shows the actual enhancement is less than 30% for all masses, necessitating updates to the original reactor photon spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to correct an overestimated enhancement factor (10x) from a prior study, which claimed significant production boosts of dark photons via Compton scattering in reactor environments. The authors aim to provide a more accurate assessment using detailed simulations.

Method: The method involves revisiting reactor dark photon production mechanisms, conducting GEANT-based simulations to model photon oscillations between ordinary and dark photons, and analyzing their interactions with matter in the reactor environment.

Result: Results show that while photon scattering increases dark photon production, the enhancement is under 30% for all masses—not the previously reported 10x. Simulations confirm this lower correction factor.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that prior estimates overstate dark photon production enhancements. Future studies must adjust mixing parameter limits and update reactor photon spectra to reflect these corrected values.

Abstract: In recent article [PhysRevD.109.055041 (2024)] it has been argued that production of dark photons -- hypothetical massive vectors -- in nuclear reactors via mixing with the visible photons is considerably enhanced (by a factor of 10) due to Compton scattering of the latter. We revisit the production of dark photons in the reactor environment and find that although the scattering of photons indeed leads to a larger number of produced dark photons, the overall enhancement is considerably smaller than what has been obtained in Ref. [PhysRevD.109.055041 (2024)]. Our findings are validated using GEANT simulations, which take into account oscillations between ordinary and visible photons and interaction of the latter with matter. The correction to the limit on mixing parameter between dark and visible photons is expected to be below 30% for all masses. It's application must be accompanied with an update on the original spectrum of photons produced in nuclear reactions inside the nuclear reactor.

Abstract: We study the Dalitz decays of heavy quarkonia, which result from the internal virtual photon conversion into an $\ell^+ \ell^-$ lepton pair. Heavy-quark symmetries allow us to establish systematic relations between transitions of different quarkonium states, and to precisely determine the branching fractions for several charmonium and bottomonium decay modes. For charmonium, existing data on $χ_{cJ}(1P)\to J/ψ\ell^+ \ell^-$ and $ψ(2S)\to χ_{cJ}(1P) \ell^+ \ell^-$ enable us to determine the parameters of the transition form factors and to predict the rates of yet-unobserved modes. The Dalitz transitions of $χ_{c1}(3872)$ are important, as they can help assessing the structure of this meson. For bottomonium, recent LHCb measurements allow us to predict the branching fractions of $χ_{bJ}(nP)\to Υ(1S)\ell^+ \ell^-$ and $h_b(nP)\to η_b(1S) \ell^+ \ell^-$ ($n=1,\,2)$. We also investigate the sensitivity of heavy quarkonia Dalitz modes to the contribution of a new light vector mediator, such as the putative $X(17)$.

*Enrique Fernández-Martínez,Ana Luisa Foguel,Xabier Marcano,Daniel Naredo-Tuero,Vsevolod Syvolap,Kevin A. Urquía-Calderón*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a low-scale Inverse Seesaw mechanism with a gauged and spontaneously broken B-L symmetry, leading to a stable dark matter candidate and dark radiation. It examines freeze-in production of dark matter via B-L gauge bosons, ensuring consistency with cosmological constraints and supporting ARS leptogenesis. Future experiments could probe this scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the Inverse Seesaw mechanism can be dynamically realized at low scales under a gauged B-L symmetry, addressing dark matter stability, dark radiation contributions, and leptogenesis while evading thermalization issues of heavy neutral leptons.

Method: Analysis of a model with gauged B-L symmetry, calculating dark matter relic abundance via freeze-in mechanism through B-L gauge bosons. Parameter space is constrained by cosmological and lab data, ensuring compatibility with dark radiation limits and ARS leptogenesis viability.

Result: Identified viable parameter regions that satisfy all constraints, prevent thermalization of heavy neutral leptons, and maintain consistency between dark matter production, dark radiation, and leptogenesis requirements.

Conclusion: The model presents a predictive framework where future surveys and experiments like SHiP can test the parameter space, bridging particle physics with cosmological observations.

Abstract: We study a dynamical realization of the low-scale Inverse Seesaw mechanism in which the approximate $B-L$ symmetry is gauged and spontaneously broken. Anomaly cancellation requires additional chiral fermions, one of which becomes a stable dark matter candidate after symmetry breaking, while another remains massless and contributes to dark radiation. Focusing on the regime of feeble gauge interactions, we compute the dark matter relic abundance produced via the freeze-in mechanism through the $B-L$ gauge boson and identify the parameter space consistent with cosmological and laboratory constraints. We show that the same region naturally avoids thermalization of heavy neutral leptons, preserving the viability of ARS leptogenesis. The interplay between dark matter production, dark radiation constraints, and leptogenesis requirements leads to a predictive scenario where future cosmological surveys and intensity-frontier experiments such as SHiP can probe significant portions of the viable parameter space.

### [78] [Baryogenesis and EDMs in the 2HDM+CS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17695)
*Björn Garbrecht,Edward Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel scenario combining Higgsogenesis and EDM constraints using a two-Higgs doublet model with a complex scalar and Majorana fermion. It involves a three-step baryogenesis process and finds that resonant enhancement allows for lighter singlet masses and potential EDM signals without requiring a first-order phase transition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a new mechanism for baryogenesis that links CP violation in the Higgs sector with EDM observations, avoiding the necessity of a first-order electroweak phase transition and providing a framework to interpret cosmological and experimental bounds coherently.

Method: A joint numerical analysis of baryogenesis (via three-step process involving scalar decay, B-L conversion via Majorana fermion, and sphaleron processes) and EDM contributions in a two-Higgs doublet model with complex scalar and Majorana fermion. Resonant enhancement effects are considered.

Result: Baryogenesis achievable with singlet masses as low as 1e5 GeV due to resonant effects; parameter regions exist where the model simultaneously produces observable EDMs (electron/neutron) and viable baryon asymmetry.

Conclusion: The proposed scenario offers a viable alternative for connecting baryogenesis and EDM signals through Higgs sector CP violation without relying on electroweak phase transitions, opening new avenues for testing with future EDM experiments and collider searches.

Abstract: We perform the first joint analysis of baryogenesis from initial Higgs charges (also called Higgsogenesis) and EDMs in a model with two Higgs doublets, a complex scalar and a Majorana fermion. In our proposed scenario, baryogenesis happens in three steps: (1) The decay of the scalar produces an asymmetry between the two Higgs doublets which is partly transferred to fermions via Standard Model processes. (2) This asymmetry is converted into a $B-L$ charge via interactions mediated by the Majorana fermion. (3) The weak sphaleron processes partially convert the resulting $B-L$ charge into a $B$ asymmetry. We perform a numerical analysis of baryogenesis and the EDM contributions and find that, due to resonant enhancement, baryogenesis is possible with singlet masses as low as $10^5$ GeV. We also find that for some parameters, the model can give large contributions to the electron and neutron EDM while also producing baryogenesis. The present scenario offers a new perspective on interpreting observational bounds in terms of cosmology: Because it relies on out-of-equilibrium decays, the questions of baryogenesis and $CP$ violation in the Higgs sector may be linked with EDM signals without the additional assumption of a first order electroweak phase transition.

*Leonardo Grimaldi,Michele Lucente,Silvia Pascoli*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates how entropy dilution from a supercooled first-order phase transition impacts leptogenesis parameter space. It shows that the viable parameter space is significantly reduced and may be excluded by future experiments, linking leptogenesis to SGWB and neutrino physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effect of entropy dilution caused by a supercooled first-order phase transition, motivated by detected stochastic gravitational waves, on the baryon asymmetry produced via leptogenesis.

Method: The authors use the Type-I seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos as a benchmark. They analyze the interplay between entropy release from phase transitions and leptogenesis, calculating the resulting parameter space constraints.

Result: The analysis demonstrates significant reduction in viable leptogenesis parameter space due to entropy dilution. Optimal SGWB points in phase transition models could entirely exclude testable regions for future experiments.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a critical connection between leptogenesis, SGWB signals, first-order phase transitions, and neutrino mass generation. The study's framework is extendable to other models and entropy mechanisms.

Abstract: Leptogenesis is one of the most popular mechanisms to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. A generic feature of leptogenesis is a large separation of scales between the epoch of baryon asymmetry production (sphaleron freeze-out at temperature $T \sim 130$ GeV) and the one where it affects the big bang nucleosynthesis processes (BBN at $T \sim 1$ MeV). Any entropy release between these two epochs would lead to a dilution of previously produced relics, such as the baryons. Motivated by the recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range, we consider the case of supercooled first-order phase transition and we study the impact of the induced entropy dilution on the leptogenesis parameter space. We employ the Type-I seesaw with 2 right-handed neutrinos as benchmark scenario, and demonstrate that the viable leptogenesis parameter space is significantly reduced. Interestingly, the values of dilution predicted by the SGWB best fit points in several first order phase transition scenarios would completely exclude the leptogenesis parameter space testable by future experiments, thus establishing a phenomenological interconnection between leptogenesis, SGWB, first order phase transition and neutrino mass generation. Our analysis can be generalised to different leptogenesis models and entropy dilution mechanisms.

### [80] [Unified study of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) π^+π^- (K^+ K^-)$ and $B_s^0 \to ψ(2S) π^+π^- (K^+ K^-)$ processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17754)
*Yun-Hua Chen*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzed $B_s^0$ meson decays involving $ψ(2S)$, $X(3872)$, and light meson pairs, revealing universal coupling constants between certain processes and evidence against $X(3872)$ being a pure charmonium state. The $f_0(1500)$ resonance significantly influences these decays despite limited phase space, and predictions for branching fraction ratios and $K^+K^-$ spectra are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the universality of couplings in $B_s^0$ decays, determine the nature of $X(3872)$, and explore the role of $f_0(1500)$ in these processes using a unitarity-constrained framework.

Method: Unitary and analytic parametrization of final-state interactions to analyze invariant mass spectra and branching ratios of $B_s^0 \to ψ(2S)/X(3872) π^+π^-$/$K^+ K^-$ decays. Comparisons between coupling constants of related decay processes.

Result: Universal coupling constants observed for $B_s^0 \to ψ(2S)/J/ψ π^+π^-$; $X(3872)$ couplings are half those of $ψ(2S)$, suggesting non-charmonium components; $f_0(1500)$ impacts decay dynamics significantly. Predicted $K^+K^-$ branching ratio and spectrum for $ψ(2S)$ modes.

Conclusion: The $X(3872)$ is likely a hybrid or molecular state rather than pure charmonium. The $f_0(1500)$ plays a critical role in $B_s^0$ decays despite limited phase space. Predictions validate the model's applicability to unobserved decay modes.

Abstract: We perform a unified description of the experimental data of the $π^+π^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to ψ(2S) π^+π^-$, the $π^+π^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) π^+π^- (K^+ K^-)$, and the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}φ}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)π^+ π^-)$. The strong final state interactions between the two pseudoscalars are taken into account using a parametrization fulfilling unitarity and analyticity. We find that there is universality in the coupling constants for $B_s^0 \to ψ(2S) π^+π^-$ and $B_s^0 \to J/ψπ^+π^-$ processes. While the couplings of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) π^+π^-$ are about half of magnitude smaller than the couplings of $B_s^0 \to ψ(2S) π^+π^-$, which indicates that the $X(3872)$ is different from a pure charmonium state. Furthermore, we find that the $f_0(1500)$ plays an important role in the $B_s^0 \to ψ(2S) π^+π^-$ and the $B_s^0 \to X(3872) π^+π^- (K^+ K^-)$ processes, though the phase space of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) f_0(1500)$ is small. Also we predict the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to ψ(2S)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}φ}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to ψ(2S)π^+ π^-]$ and the $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass distribution of $B_s^0 \to ψ(2S)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}φ}$.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents pQCD predictions for high-momentum particle suppression in light ion collisions, showing energy loss scales with $(\sqrt{AB})^{1/3}$ and highlights ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$/${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ isotopes as clean environments to observe quark-gluon plasma-induced energy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study partonic energy loss mechanisms in small collision systems and quantify suppression effects through pQCD calculations, providing constraints for nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF).

Method: Calculations based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) incorporating partonic energy loss models, analyzing symmetric and asymmetric ion collisions such as ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}+{}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and $A+B$ systems. Deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ is used to constrain nPDF baselines.

Result: Predicted suppression of high-momentum particles across systems from ${}^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ down to ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ collisions. Energy loss scaling with $(\sqrt{AB})^{1/3}$ was observed. ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ demonstrate tight constraints on nPDF, enhancing sensitivity to quark-gluon plasma effects.

Conclusion: Light ion collisions, particularly those involving ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$/${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$, offer a pristine environment to discern final-state partonic energy loss from nPDF effects, supporting the use of these isotopes in experiments to probe quark-gluon plasma formation.

Abstract: We present perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) predictions for the modification to the yield of high-momentum particles in very light ion collisions - ${}^{10}\mathrm{B} + {}^{10}\mathrm{B}$, ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li} + {}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He} + {}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{3}\mathrm{He} + {}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ - both with and without medium-induced energy loss. We show that there is non-trivial suppression expected from our partonic energy loss model in symmetric systems from ${}^{208}\mathrm{Pb} + {}^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ to ${}^{3}\mathrm{He} + {}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and in asymmetric systems $A + B$, and that the energy loss scales approximately with $(\sqrt{A B})^{1 / 3}$. Further, we find that deep inelastic scattering measurements in ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ tightly constrain the nPDF baseline, making these isotopes a particularly clean environment for observing final-state partonic energy loss induced by the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in these very small systems.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops a Gaussian model to evaluate beyond-eikonal operators for dijet production in deep inelastic scattering, showing that only specific operators and three-point correlators contribute at next-to-eikonal accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the Color Glass Condensate framework beyond the eikonal approximation by addressing the challenges posed by decorated dipole and quadrupole operators, aiming to accurately model higher-order corrections in high-energy scattering processes.

Method: The authors use a Gaussian model to compute beyond-eikonal Wilson line structures, focusing on dijet production in deep inelastic scattering. They validate the model at the eikonal level and analyze all next-to-eikonal operator contributions, discarding those that vanish or do not contribute.

Result: Most next-to-eikonal operators do not contribute to the dijet cross section; contributions arise only from specific operators and next-to-eikonal three-point correlators. The derived expressions are numerically implementable.

Conclusion: The Gaussian model successfully isolates the dominant next-to-eikonal effects for dijet production, providing a practical framework for precise high-energy scattering calculations beyond the eikonal limit.

Abstract: We develop a Gaussian model to evaluate the decorated dipole and quadrupole operators that arise beyond the eikonal approximation in the Color Glass Condensate framework. While the method is general and applicable to arbitrary beyond-eikonal Wilson line structures, we employ it for dijet production in deep inelastic scattering at next-to-eikonal accuracy. After validating the model at the eikonal level, we compute all next-to-eikonal operator structures entering the dijet cross section. We show that some of them do not contribute to this observable, while others vanish identically. Therefore, in the Gaussian model next-to-eikonal corrections to dijet production in deep inelastic scattering originate solely from a given type of operators and from next-to-eikonal three-point correlators. The resulting expressions are provided in a form suitable for numerical implementation.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the sensitivity of displaced vertex searches at the LHC for heavy neutral leptons (sterile neutrinos) in a supersymmetric model, using ATLAS data and projections for future runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore constraints on sterile neutrino models and assess the discovery potential of the LHC runs for these particles, considering their production in higgsino decays and interactions with ATLAS detector efficiencies.

Method: Utilizes model-independent reconstruction efficiencies from ATLAS, applies them to a supersymmetric framework where sterile neutrinos arise from higgsino decays, and evaluates current bounds and future reach using 139 fb⁻¹ Run 2 data.

Result: Excludes sterile neutrino masses 20–230 GeV and mixings 4×10⁻¹⁴ to ~3×10⁻¹⁰. HL-LHC could extend reach to 295 GeV and mixings down to 3×10⁻¹⁴.

Conclusion: Results provide robust constraints within the SUSY model and suggest broad applicability to non-SUSY models where sterile neutrinos are produced via electroweak pair-produced heavier particles.

Abstract: We study the sensitivity of displaced vertex searches at the LHC to heavy neutral leptons (also known as sterile neutrinos) that are produced in pairs with an electroweak-size cross section. We work within the context of a supersymmetric model in which the sterile neutrino is produced along with Standard Model particles in higgsino decays. By making use of model-independent reconstruction efficiencies provided by the ATLAS collaboration in their search for displaced vertices with multiple jets, we obtain constraints on this model from $139$ fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by ATLAS during the LHC Run~2, and assess the discovery reach of Run~3 and of the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Depending on the higgsino mass parameter, sterile neutrino masses between $20~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $230~\mathrm{GeV}$ and active-sterile neutrino mixings in the range $4 \times 10^{-14} \lesssim V^2_N \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-10}$ can be excluded. At the HL-LHC, discovery-level significances could be reached for sterile neutrinos masses up to $295~\mathrm{GeV}$ and values of $V^2_N$ down to $3 \times 10^{-14}$. Finally, moving away from the supersymmetric scenario, we study to which extent these results can be generalized to a broader class of models in which the sterile neutrinos are produced in the decays of heavier particles that are themselves pair-produced with an electroweak-size cross section.

Abstract: This paper presents the first dedicated study of the boosted $HH \to b\bar{b}γγ$ topology as a key probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) in the high-energy double-Higgs boson regime. The analysis presented in this paper, focuses on two classes of new-physics scenarios: non-resonant deviations of the quartic gauge--Higgs interaction, parameterized by the coupling modifier $κ_{2V}$, and resonant enhancement arising from the decay of a heavy scalar state, modeled within a two-Higgs-doublet framework. We demonstrate that the boosted reconstruction category enhances sensitivity to beyond SM effects that populate the high-$m_{HH}$ tail, yielding improved constraints on $κ_{2V}$ and extending the discovery reach for heavy resonances.

Abstract: The all-sky very-high-energy ($10^4-10^6$ GeV) atmospheric muon flux measured by IceCube shows a spectral hardening at the highest energies, indicating the presence of a prompt component. IceCube has also measured the atmospheric muon neutrino flux at high energy. However, since this flux is dominated by astrophysical neutrinos, only an upper bound can be placed on the prompt atmospheric $ν_μ+\barν_μ$ contribution. In this work, we provide a new evaluation of the prompt atmospheric muon flux including an intrinsic charm component in the cosmic ray-air interactions. The latter enhances the forward production of $\bar{D}^0$, $D^-$, and $Λ_c$, which subsequently decay into final states containing muons and muon neutrinos. We show how the increase in the prompt muon flux due to intrinsic charm is accompanied by a corresponding enhancement in the prompt muon neutrino flux. We implement different intrinsic charm production models in MCEq to calculate the resulting lepton fluxes. We discuss the challenges of achieving predictions that are simultaneously consistent with both IceCube's high-energy atmospheric muon flux measurements and IceCube upper bound on the prompt muon neutrino flux, and we quantify the resulting discrepancies. As possible solutions, we explore scaling of the unflavored meson contributions to the prompt atmospheric muon flux to assess how such adjustments can reconcile these differences. The tensions emphasized in our work call for a refinement of the hadronic interaction models, especially the production of unflavored mesons, and for new experimental data sensitive to unflavored meson and heavy flavor production with reliable estimates of the associated uncertainties. We suggest that the energy and zenith angle dependence of muon and neutrino flux ratios from future neutrino telescope measurements may help to disentangle different scenarios.

Abstract: We perform a feasibility study to probe dark matter (DM) production at the LHC within a global $U(1)_L$ scotogenic model. The study is conducted using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method, considering the viable parameter space of the model allowed by experimental constraints such as neutrino oscillation data, the Higgs to invisible branching fraction, and DM observables. The production of scalar and fermionic DM candidates, predicted by the model, is then studied under the LHC conditions for different luminosity scenarios imposing compressed mass spectra conditions between the lightest fermion and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ odd scalars. We studied two production mechanisms, Drell-Yan and Vector Boson Fusion. It was found that the Drell-Yan mechanism gives better detection prospects for fermionic DM masses between 100-220~\textrm{GeV} at high luminosity scenarios.
