### [1] [May Negative Mass Objects exist in the sky?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15058)
*Shin'ichi Nojiri,S. D. Odintsov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility of negative mass objects (NMOs) in the universe, demonstrating they can arise as solutions to standard gravitational equations under specific conditions involving positive and negative mass systems. It also investigates their gravitational effects and possible observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that NMOs are overly exotic by showing they can exist within conventional gravitational frameworks under certain configurations, potentially offering new perspectives on gravitational interactions and cosmic phenomena.

Method: The authors analyze gravitational equations in systems combining positive mass objects, cosmological fluid, and negative cosmological constants. They construct models using two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to generate NMO solutions. Orbital dynamics of photons and particles around NMOs are studied, along with stability of systems containing both positive and negative masses.

Result: NMOs are shown to produce repulsive gravity (effective anti-gravity), allowing bound systems of positive and negative masses despite repulsion. The paper also considers extremely rare 'zero-mass' objects. Observational possibilities are proposed, and a speculative mass range for NMOs suggested.

Conclusion: Negative mass objects are theoretically plausible under specific conditions, challenging traditional views of their exotic nature. Their gravitational effects and potential observability open avenues for further research into unconventional mass configurations and their cosmic implications.

Abstract: We conjecture the possibility of negative mass objects (NMOs) existing in the sky. It is shown that they may not be so exotic as usually expected. We show that NMOs appear as solutions of standard gravitational equations if we consider the system of a compact positive mass object, cosmological fluid and negative cosmological constant. We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties.

### [2] [Horizon-Brightened Acceleration Radiation and Optical Signatures of Generic Regular Black Holes from Nonlinear Electrodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15077)
*Uktamjon Uktamov,Ali Övgün,Reggie C. Pantig,Bobomurat Ahmedov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures in regular black holes formed by nonlinear electrodynamics. The study examines horizon structure, thermodynamics, shadow sizes, and quantum radiation properties, using observational data to constrain model parameters and linking quantum effects to thermodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how regular black holes (free of singularities) sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics affect optical observations (like shadow sizes) and quantum radiation (HBAR), and to test these models against real data from telescopes like the Event Horizon Telescope. The aim is to understand the interplay between black hole structure, electrodynamics, and quantum effects.

Method: The authors analyze static, spherically symmetric regular black hole spacetimes (e.g., Bardeen and Hayward models), compute optical observables (photon sphere, shadow size), and use MCMC analysis with EHT/GRAVITY data to constrain parameters. Quantum analysis involves near-horizon reduction for HBAR, Lindblad master equations, and deriving an entropy-energy relation.

Result: Key results include parameter constraints from observational data, quantified degeneracies between black hole mass and electrodynamics parameters, identification of conformal behavior in HBAR's detector response, a thermal spectrum tied to horizon temperature, and a Wien-like law linking peak wavelength to thermodynamics. The study shows regular black holes can produce observably different shadows and quantum signatures compared to Schwarzschild metrics.

Conclusion: Regular black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics offer a testable alternative to singular black holes, with distinct optical and quantum signatures. The derived Wien-type law and thermal relations provide new tools to observationally probe black hole regularity and nonlinear electrodynamics effects. Future observations could distinguish these models from classical predictions.

Abstract: We investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures for a broad class of regular black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics. The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation.

### [3] [Black-hole thermodynamics in doubly special relativity: local-frame MDRs and rainbow metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15216)
*Abdelmalek Boumali*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores doubly special relativity (DSR) extensions in curved spacetimes, comparing three approaches to modified dispersion relations (MDRs) and finding that two methods yield the same Hawking temperature when using the same deformation energy scale. The results indicate that DSR effects are negligible for macroscopic black holes but become significant near the Planck scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in extending DSR's modified dispersion relations to curved spacetimes without reintroducing preferred frames, and to compare different approaches to ensure consistency in defining the deformation energy scale.

Method: The authors analyze static spherically symmetric black-hole thermodynamics under two DSR implementations: (A) local-frame MDR on an energy-independent background and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metrics. They compute Hawking temperatures and compare results using specific examples like Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin invariants.

Result: Both approaches (A and B) produce identical Hawking temperatures when the deformation energy scale $E_\star$ is defined consistently. For instance, Amelino-Camelia-type MDRs show a temperature correction proportional to $E_\star/E_{\rm Pl}$, while Magueijo-Smolin invariant yields an unaltered $T_0$. The study also highlights discrepancies due to different $E_\star$ interpretations (local frame vs. energy at infinity).

Conclusion: DSR modifications to black-hole thermodynamics are suppressed for large black holes but become relevant near the Planck scale. The choice of $E_\star$ is critical for reconciling results, suggesting that energy scale definition consistency is essential for avoiding contradictions in future studies.

Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) deforms special-relativistic kinematics while preserving the relativity principle by introducing a second invariant scale, typically the Planck energy $E_{\rm Pl}$. Extending DSR-inspired modified dispersion relations (MDRs) to curved spacetimes is challenging, as ambiguous definitions of the deformation energy risk reintroducing preferred frames.
  We review three common extensions beyond flat spacetime: (i) MDRs in local orthonormal frames on fixed backgrounds, (ii) phase-space/Hamiltonian geometry with relative locality, and (iii) rainbow metrics. Using black-hole thermodynamics for static spherically symmetric horizons, we compare two implementations: (A) energy-independent background with local-frame MDR, and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metric.
  When the same prescription is used for the deformation energy scale $E_\star$, both approaches yield identical Hawking temperatures: \begin{equation} T(E_\star)=T_0\,\frac{g(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}{f(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}\,,\qquad T_0=\frac{κ_0}{2π}\,, \end{equation} where $κ_0$ is the classical surface gravity.
  This $g/f$ scaling holds for examples such as Amelino--Camelia-type MDRs (leading correction $\propto E p^2/E_{\rm Pl}$, giving $T(E_\star)\simeq T_0(1-\fracη{2}E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})$ for $η>0$) and the Magueijo--Smolin invariant ($f=g$, so $T(E_\star)=T_0$).
  Further DSR effects on evaporation (thresholds, phase space, greybody factors, composition laws) are discussed. Discrepancies in the literature arise mainly from different choices of $E_\star$ (energy at infinity vs.\ local frame). For macroscopic black holes, corrections are suppressed by $T_0/E_{\rm Pl}$ and become relevant only near the Planck regime, where full quantum gravity dominates.

### [4] [Investigation of the gravitational dust collapse of the LQG-inspired effective asymmetric bounce model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15227)
*Kristina Giesel,Hongguang Liu,Eric Rullit*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines gravitational dust collapse using an asymmetric bounce LQG-inspired model, showing singularity resolution but a new shell-crossing singularity in the polymerised vacuum. They find different critical mass thresholds for horizon formation pre and post-bounce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous LQG dust collapse studies beyond symmetric bounces or homogeneous dust, exploring asymmetric bounce phenomenology, especially singularity behavior and horizon formation differences.

Method: Combination of analytical and numerical methods analyzing an LQG-inspired model with inhomogeneous dust, focusing on marginally bound cases, singularity resolution, and trapped surface formation.

Result: Central singularity resolved as in symmetric models, but shell-crossing singularity appears in vacuum region during bounce. Critical mass threshold exists for pre-bounce horizons but not post-bounce ones.

Conclusion: Asymmetric bounce models exhibit unique singularities and horizon dynamics not seen in symmetric cases, indicating asymmetric effects significantly alter post-bounce spacetime behaviors.

Abstract: We investigate gravitational dust collapse within an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG)-inspired model exhibiting an asymmetric bounce in the marginally bound case. This work extends previous studies, which have predominantly focused on models with either symmetric bounces or asymmetric bounces restricted to homogeneous dust configurations. Our analysis emphasises the phenomenological implications of the model through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, with particular attention to singularity resolution and the formation of trapped surfaces. As in symmetric bounce models, the central curvature singularity inside the collapsing dust cloud is resolved. However, in contrast to the symmetric case, we find that a singularity emerges in the polymerised vacuum region during the bounce phase. This singularity can be identified as a shell-crossing singularity and exhibits the expected power-law behaviour of curvature scalars. Furthermore, likewise to the symmetric bounce models, we find a critical mass threshold governing the formation of inner and outer horizons in the pre-bounce phase. No analogous critical mass restriction arises for the formation of the inner horizon in the post-bounce phase, highlighting a qualitative difference between the pre- and post-bounce dynamics.

### [5] [Particle production, absorption, scattering, and geodesics in a Schwarzschild--Hernquist black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15420)
*N. Heidari,A. A. Araújo Filho,P. H. M. Barros*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This study examines how Schwarzschild black holes within Hernquist dark matter halos affect quantum (Hawking radiation, particle production) and classical (geodesics, wave scattering) phenomena, showing dark matter suppresses emissions and alters trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between black holes and dark matter environments by analyzing both quantum effects like Hawking radiation and classical phenomena such as particle motion and wave scattering.

Method: Semiclassical techniques for particle production analysis, Bogoliubov transformations and tunneling method for Hawking radiation derivation, partial-wave analysis for wave scattering, and geodesic equations for trajectory studies in the composite spacetime geometry.

Result: Dark matter halo parameters (scale radius/density) reduce particle emission rates and extend evaporation times, alter wave scattering cross sections, and modify light/matter trajectories compared to vacuum Schwarzschild scenarios.

Conclusion: Dark matter significantly modifies black hole observational signatures, necessitating consideration of halo properties in astrophysical models and influencing Hawking radiation predictions/evaporation dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate quantum and classical signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter halo. Starting from the exact spherically symmetric solution describing this composite system, we analyze particle production for both bosonic and fermionic fields using semiclassical techniques. Hawking radiation is derived through Bogoliubov transformations and independently via the tunneling method with energy conservation, allowing us to identify the effective temperature, emission spectrum, and the role of dark matter parameters in suppressing particle creation. The evaporation process is examined in the high-frequency regime, leading to modified evaporation times and emission rates relative to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We further study absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves employing a partial-wave analysis, computing phase shifts, partial and total cross sections, and assessing the impact of the Hernquist scale radius and density on these observables. Finally, null and timelike geodesics are explored to characterize light propagation and particle motion in the presence of the dark matter halo.

### [6] [Static black holes in an external uniform electromagnetic field: Reissner-Nordstrom accelerating in Bertotti-Robinson](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15462)
*Hryhorii Ovcharenko,Jiri Podolsky*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the non-twisting subcase of type D black holes with a non-aligned electromagnetic field, categorizing them into two subclasses analogous to uncharged Schwarzschild/C-metric or charged Reissner-Nordström black holes accelerating in a Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. The distinction hinges on the parameter r₀, with subtle dependencies on charge, mass signs, and extreme black holes analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the structure and classification of a specific class of black hole solutions in general relativity, particularly those with non-aligned electromagnetic fields. The study aims to provide a clearer interpretation of existing solutions and their relationships to known metrics like Schwarzschild, C-metric, and Reissner-Nordström within the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime context.

Method: The authors perform a detailed analysis of the non-twisting subcase of type D black holes, using parametrization techniques and parameter limits (r₀=0 vs r₀≠0) to distinguish between subclasses. They compare with previous solutions (Van den Bergh, Carminati, Alekseev-Garcia) to establish connections.

Result: Two main subclasses are identified: one resembling the uncharged Schwarzschild/C-metric in AdS₂×S₂ geometry (r₀=0) and another representing accelerating charged black holes (r₀≠0). The analysis uncovers dependencies on black hole charge, mass sign, and extreme cases, clarifying their relation to prior works.

Conclusion: The study solidifies the classification of these black hole solutions, showing they fit into known frameworks with nuanced extensions. It resolves ambiguities in limits and properties, offering a unified perspective on solutions by Van den Bergh/Carminati and others within the Bertotti-Robinson context.

Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the non-twisting subcase of the large class of type D black holes with a non-aligned electromagnetic field, presented recently in [H. Ovcharenko and J. Podolsky, Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 064076]. We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\mathrm{AdS}_2\times\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $Φ_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work. We also show the explicit relation to solutions previously found by Van den Bergh and Carminati, and we discuss the connection to the Alekseev-Garcia and Alexeev solutions.

### [7] [A fresh look at boundary terms in Einstein-Hilbert gravity via an initial value variational principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15469)
*Songmin Ha,Alexander Rothkopf*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity using the Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action for initial value problems, showing it naturally produces well-posed boundary conditions without extra terms, offering a new method to solve spacetime metrics directly from the action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of formulating Einstein's equations as a well-posed initial value problem by constructing an action principle that inherently handles boundary terms and eliminates the need for additional constraints.

Method: Constructing an SKG action for gravity through degree-of-freedom doubling and foliation independence. The approach decomposes the action into bulk terms (Einstein's equations) and boundary terms related to conserved quantities like Komar mass, with minimal connecting conditions on boundaries.

Result: Demonstrates that the SKG action yields a well-posed initial value problem without requiring non-trivial boundary terms, as only trivial connecting conditions are necessary. This provides a direct action-based method to compute spacetime metrics bypassing traditional field equations.

Conclusion: The SKG formalism offers a novel, self-contained variational approach for gravitational initial value problems, simplifying boundary treatments and providing an independent method to solve spacetime dynamics via action principles instead of differential equations.

Abstract: A key tenet of general relativity is the dynamical nature of space-time, ideally represented as an initial value problem. Here we explore the variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity as initial value problem by constructing its Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action, including a careful treatment of boundary terms. The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations.

### [8] [On the Limitations of Karmarkar's Condition in Static, Conformally Flat Spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15486)
*Samstuti Chanda,Ranjan Sharma,Sunil D. Maharaj*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores exact solutions for static, spherically symmetric spacetimes under Karmarkar's condition and conformal flatness, leading to the Schwarzschild interior and de Sitter solutions. It highlights that these conditions eliminate pressure anisotropy and complexity factor, but restrict applicability to stellar models without additional factors like time-dependent metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Karmarkar's condition and conformal flatness directly produce known solutions and restrict matter composition, while identifying limitations for realistic stellar modeling without additional assumptions.

Method: Imposing Karmarkar's condition and vanishing Weyl tensor (conformal flatness) on static, spherically symmetric spacetimes to derive exact solutions and analyze their properties.

Result: The solutions correspond to the Schwarzschild interior (incompressible fluid sphere) and de Sitter (vacuum energy), showing null pressure anisotropy and complexity factor. These conditions uniquely determine the spacetime but may limit use for realistic star models without extra considerations.

Conclusion: While the geometric constraints effectively derive known solutions, they overly constrain matter properties, suggesting Karmarkar's method alone isn't sufficient for realistic stellar models in conformally flat spacetimes without time-dependent metrics.

Abstract: For a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate the class of exact solutions that arise when two fundamental geometric constraints are imposed simultaneously: the Karmarkar's condition and the vanishing of the Weyl tensor. These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials.

### [9] [Displacement memory in regular black hole spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15523)
*Ritwik Acharyya,Sayan Kar*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines displacement memory effects in regular black hole spacetimes using geodesic methods, revealing parameter-dependent differences compared to singular black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the presence of a wave pulse affects displacement memory in regular black holes, and to compare with singular black holes.

Method: The study employs geodesic separation and deviation analysis in a Bondi-Sachs spacetime model with a sech-squared H(u) profile, conducted numerically both in flat backgrounds and far from black hole horizons.

Result: Results show displacement memory dependent on regularization parameter g and pulse height, with notable differences between regular and singular black holes at large u.

Conclusion: Regular black holes exhibit distinct displacement memory effects that vary with parameters, suggesting their dynamics differ fundamentally from singular black holes.

Abstract: Displacement memory, induced by a wave pulse in a regular black hole spacetime, is studied using geodesic (timelike) separation and geodesic deviation. The presence of the wave pulse in such a black hole is modeled via a function $H(u)$ appearing in a restricted version of a generic Bondi-Sachs type line element. Choosing a sech-squared profile for $H(u)$, we first study (numerically) geodesic separation and geodesic deviation in a flat background. Thereafter, similar investigations are carried out in the presence of the black hole, but in regions far away from the vicinity of the horizon. Our results suggest the presence of a distinct displacement memory effect, which depends on the value of the regularisation parameter $g$ as well as the pulse height. Between different types of regular black holes, one notices parameter-dependent changes in the net displacement memory. Further, a clear difference in the magnitude of displacement memory (at large $u$) in regular and singular black holes is also visible in our numerical results.

### [10] [Some phenomenological aspects of a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black hole: quasi-periodic oscillations, scalar perturbations and thermal fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15551)
*Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,Mohsen Fathi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black holes, analyzing their effects on orbital frequencies, QPO models, scalar perturbations, greybody factors, and entropy corrections. Bayesian analysis shows quantum parameters impact QPO radii and spacetime stability, with observable thermodynamic signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how quantum corrections influence black hole dynamics and thermodynamics, and constrain parameters using QPO observations.

Method: Derived orbital frequencies for neutral particles, performed Bayesian MCMC parameter estimation with observational data, analyzed scalar perturbations via Schrödinger-like equations, computed greybody factors in geometric optics regime, and calculated entropy corrections.

Result: Quantum correction parameter ζ significantly affects QPO radii locations and ISCO separation; parameters Q and ζ influence perturbation potentials and spacetime stability; entropy corrections follow logarithmic behavior for small black holes.

Conclusion: Quantum corrections leave observable imprints on both dynamical (QPO) and thermodynamical properties, demonstrating that these parameters can be constrained via astrophysical observations.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $ζ$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $ζ$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.

*Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,Edilberto O. Silva*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines thermodynamic properties of a spherically symmetric ModMax-AdS black hole with a global monopole in Kalb-Ramond gravity, focusing on geometric parameter influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore thermodynamic criticality and parameter effects in non-traditional black hole configurations within modified gravity theories.

Method: They derived thermodynamic quantities (temperature, Gibbs free energy, specific heat), checked first law/Smarr formula validity, analyzed critical points, inversion temperatures, Hawking radiation sparsity, thermal fluctuations, and optical properties like photon spheres/shadow radii.

Result: Critical points and inversion temperatures depend on space-time parameters; entropy corrections and shadow features are parameter-sensitive.

Conclusion: Geometric parameters significantly affect thermodynamic behavior and optical properties of ModMax-AdS black holes with global monopoles in Kalb-Ramond gravity.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate in detail the thermodynamic properties of a spherically symmetric ModMax-AdS black hole sourced by a global monopole within the Kalb-Ramond gravity. We derive the key thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and analyze how the geometric parameters influence these physical quantities. The first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr formula are explicitly verified. Furthermore, we study the thermodynamic criticality of the system by deriving the critical points and examining the effects of the space-time geometric parameters. We also obtain the inversion temperature and demonstrate that the minimum inversion temperature is modified by the space-time parameters. In addition, the sparsity of Hawking radiation and thermal fluctuations of the system are investigated, highlighting the effects of the parameters on the entropy corrections. Finally, we analyze the optical properties of the black hole, in particular the photon sphere and shadow radius, showing how these parameters influence these features.

### [12] [Periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms of spinning particles in nonlocal Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15609)
*Moisés Bravo-Gaete,Jianhui Lin,Yunlong Liu,Xiangdong Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the dynamics and gravitational-wave signatures of spinning particles orbiting static, spherically symmetric black holes in Deser-Woodward nonlocal gravity. It compares outcomes with Schwarzschild black holes, focusing on effects of parameters ζ and b. These parameters influence orbital stability (like innermost stable circular orbit) and gravitational wave phases. The study shows that certain parameter values (b=2, ζ≈10^-6) create distinguishable gravitational waveforms (M=0.0125), enabling observational tests between nonlocal gravity and general relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how nonlocal gravity parameters affect orbital dynamics and gravitational waves compared to general relativity, providing a means to observationally distinguish the theories.

Method: Uses Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations with Tulczyjew spin condition. Derives orbital equations for spinning particles in nonlocal gravity, applies timelike constraints. Compares effective potentials and ISCOs with Schwarzschild. Simulates extreme mass ratio inspirals to analyze waveform phase differences caused by ζ and b.

Result: Parameters ζ induces phase delay, b induces phase advance. At b=2 and ζ=1e-6, waveform mismatch reaches 0.0125 – detectable distinction from Schwarzschild. Demonstrates nonlocal gravity's observable impacts on gravitational waves.

Conclusion: Nonlocal gravity parameters leave detectable imprints on gravitational wave signatures. This offers a viable method for testing gravitational theories through observations of extreme mass ratio inspirals and similar astrophysical events.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics and gravitational-wave signatures of periodic orbits of spinning test particles moving in the equatorial plane around static, spherically symmetric black holes within the framework of Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity. Based on the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, combined with the Tulczyjew spin supplementary condition, we derive the orbital dynamic equations for spinning particles moving in the equatorial plane and impose a timelike constraint to exclude unphysical superluminal trajectories. By comparing with the classical Schwarzschild black hole, we systematically analyze the effects of the nonlocal gravitational parameters $ζ$ and $b$ on the effective potential governing the radial motion of particles and the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, gravitational waveforms exhibit significant phase differences: an increase in $ζ$ induces a phase delay, whereas an increase in $b$ results in a phase advance. A one-year simulation of the orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral demonstrates that when $b=2$ and $ζ\approx10^{-6}$, the mismatch between the gravitational waveforms predicted for the nonlocal gravity black hole and those for the Schwarzschild black hole reaches the distinguishable threshold ($\mathcal{M}=0.0125$), providing a basis for observational discrimination between general relativity and nonlocal gravity.

### [13] [Expansion operators in spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15628)
*Xiaotian Fei,Gaoping Long,Yongge Ma,Cong Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper quantizes ingoing and outgoing null expansions of a spatial 2-sphere in loop quantum gravity's spherically symmetric model, showing they have self-adjoint expansion operators with shared continuous spectra but distinct isolated eigenvalues. This avoids classical singularities and establishes quantum horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand singularity resolution in general relativity and define quantum horizons through quantization of null expansions.

Method: Quantization of ingoing/outgoing null expansions in spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity using kinematical Hilbert space techniques.

Result: Expansion operators are self-adjoint with shared continuous spectra plus unique discrete eigenvalues, indicating singularity avoidance and quantum horizon structure.

Conclusion: Quantum处理 of null expansions successfully avoids classical singularities and provides a framework for quantum horizons in loop quantum gravity.

Abstract: The ingoing and outgoing null expansions associated to a spatial 2-sphere are quantized in the spherically symmetric model of loop quantum gravity. It is shown that the resulting expansion operators are self-adjoint in the kinematical Hilbert space with generalized eigenstates. It turns out that the outgoing and ingoing expansion operators share the common continuous part of their spectra but have different additional isolated eigenvalues. These results provide new insights on the avoidance of the singularities in classical general relativity and the establishment of certain notion of quantum horizons.

TL;DR: The paper explores the dynamics of charged null fluids undergoing timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry within general relativity. It demonstrates that any timelike curve segment in quotient spacetimes can be a bounce hypersurface, constructs spacetimes with specific metric regularity, and solves a free boundary problem for timelike bounce formation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the viability and properties of timelike bounce scenarios suggested by previous case studies on black hole formation. This helps understand how charged null dust's directional changes due to electrostatic repulsion affect spacetime dynamics and Einstein's equations.

Method: The authors analyze the equations of motion for charged null dust in spherical symmetry, construct spacetime solutions with $C^{2,1}$ metric regularity across bounce surfaces, and formulate/solve a free boundary problem for timelike bounce formation in Reissner-Nordström exteriors.

Result: Demonstrates that timelike bounce hypersurfaces can arise from arbitrary timelike curves in quotient spacetimes, constructs hybrid spacetimes combining Vaidya and Reissner-Nordström regions, and establishes conditions for teleological constructions leading to specific boundary behaviors.

Conclusion: Timelike bounce phenomena provide a new framework for studying relativistic charged matter dynamics. The findings expand the understanding of interaction mechanisms in general relativity and open avenues for studying black hole formation and other spacetime singularities.

Abstract: We establish results on the dynamics of interacting charged null fluids in general relativity, specifically in the context of the bouncing continuation proposed in [Ori91]. In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $γ$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordström spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{μν})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordström and Vaidya regions. Across $\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{μν}\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.

### [15] [Resonant Axion-Photon Conversion in the Early Inspiral of Neutron Star Binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15065)
*D. Suárez-Fontanella,M. Ángeles Pérez-García,C. Albertus*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates axion-photon resonant conversion in the magnetospheres of merging binary neutron stars, showing detectable electromagnetic signals correlated with gravitational waves for specific axion parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the early inspiral phase of binary neutron stars as a means to probe axion-physics via resonant conversion, leveraging their magnetospheric environments and gravitational wave signals.

Method: Modeling the binary system's electromagnetic fields as rotating dipoles, incorporating plasma effects via Goldreich-Julian charge density, simulating resonant surfaces and resulting electromagnetic emission patterns linked to axion mass and gravitational wave frequencies.

Result: Resonant conversion occurs on evolving peanut-shaped surfaces, producing an electromagnetic power signal modulated by gravitational wave frequency, detectable for axion masses 50-170 μeV and coupling constants below 1e-11 GeV⁻¹.

Conclusion: Binary neutron star inspirals offer a novel multimessenger probe of axion physics, urging coordinated observations across gravitational waves and electromagnetic spectra (radio/millimeter) to constrain axion parameters.

Abstract: We consider the early binary neutron star inspiral phase as a scenario to probe environmental axion--photon resonant conversion. For this we approximately model the merger site electromagnetic fields as the superposition of two rotating dipolar stellar magnetic fields at the thousand--km scale when both magnetospheres are not largely distorted. We capture the time-sliced near-zone magnetospheric geometry relevant for axion--photon mixing. Plasma effects are incorporated through an effective Goldreich--Julian charge density, used to determine the effective plasma frequency and the location of resonant conversion surfaces. Our results show that axion--photon resonant conversion in binary magnetospheres mostly occurs on extended peanut-shaped surfaces whose global geometry evolves as the binary inspiral evolves. As a consequence, the total electromagnetic power emitted through axion--photon conversion exhibits a characteristic dependence on axion mass and a slow temporal modulation correlated with the gravitational wave frequency emission. This feature is potentially detectable for $m_a \in [50,170] \,\rm μeV$ and set $g_{a γ} \lesssim 10^{-11}\rm \,GeV^{-1}$ as it lies within the sensitivity limits of current or planned radio observation missions. In light of our results we discuss the opportunity of binary neutron star inspirals as time-dependent, multimessenger probes of axion physics, and motivate coordinated searches combining gravitational wave observations with radio and millimeter wavelength electromagnetic measurements.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents PSR J0024$-$7204ai, a 13-ms pulsar in 47 Tucanae, the slowest-spinning and most eccentric binary system in the cluster. Its periastron advance reveals a total mass of 2.41 solar masses, suggesting a massive white dwarf companion likely formed via dynamic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize new binary pulsars in globular clusters, particularly focusing on eccentric orbits and high-mass companions that could shed light on formation mechanisms and dynamical interactions within clusters.

Method: Used MeerKAT and Parkes telescope data to detect PSR J0024$-$7204ai, measured periastron advance ($\dot{\omega}$ = 0.1601 deg yr$^{-1}$), derived system parameters via timing analysis, and compared with cluster dynamics models to infer formation history.

Result: Discovered a 13.026-ms pulsar with a 1.67-day eccentric (e=0.18) orbit, yielding a maximum pulsar mass of ~1.7 M$_\odot$, and a minimum companion mass of ~0.7 M$_\odot$. Suggests a Carbon-Oxygen white dwarf companion influenced by cluster core interactions.

Conclusion: The system highlights the role of dynamical interactions in shaping binary pulsar orbits in dense clusters. Further observations are needed to refine its timing solution and evolutionary history.

Abstract: In this paper we present PSR J0024$-$7204ai, a 13.026-ms binary pulsar recently discovered in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by the MeerKAT radio telescope. This is the slowest spinning pulsar known in this globular cluster, and has a $\sim1.67$-day orbit with an eccentricity of $e\approx0.18$. Although it was not yet possible to derive an unambiguous phase-connected timing solution, by combining detections obtained from MeerKAT and archival Parkes data we were able to measure the rate of advance of periastron to high significance, $\dotω$ = 0.1601 $\pm 0.0046$ deg yr$^{-1}$. This value implies a total system mass of $2.41 \pm 0.11\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (68.3\% C. L.), which, when combined with the binary mass function, gives a maximum pulsar mass of $\sim 1.7 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a minimum companion mass of $\sim 0.7\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Apart from being the slowest pulsar in 47~Tucanae, its orbit is by far the most eccentric and its companion is the most massive among all known binary pulsars in this globular cluster. One possibility is that system is an old MSP - Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf binary, whose orbit was perturbed by stellar dynamical interactions in the cluster core. Further follow-up observations of this system will be essential for a more detailed characterisation of this system and its evolution.

### [17] [UV and Optical Signatures of Late-time Disk Instabilities in Tidal Disruption Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15103)
*Daichi Tsuna,V. Ashley Villar,Anthony L. Piro,Samantha C. Wu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explores how super-Eddington accretion during tidal disruption events (TDEs) can produce detectable UV/optical flares, linking these flares to late radio emission and proposing multiwavelength observations to test the disk instability model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the observed late radio emission in TDEs and predict UV/optical signatures of disk instabilities for detection by upcoming surveys.

Method: Modeling UV/optical reprocessing of super-Eddington accretion outflows, predicting transient luminosities, and analyzing existing ZTF data for flare limits.

Result: Predicted UV flares of 10^42-10^43 erg/s and optical flares of 10^41-10^42 erg/s for TDEs by 10^6 solar mass black holes, with upper limits on flare rates from ZTF data.

Conclusion: Future surveys like ULTRASAT and Rubin Observatory can test the disk instability model via combined UV/optical-radio monitoring of TDEs to confirm connections between accretion instabilities and radio emission.

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are unique probes of evolving accretion in supermassive black holes. Recent models of TDE disks show that they undergo brief thermal instabilities with temporal super-Eddington accretion at late times, which has been suggested as a possibility to explain the ubiquitous late radio emergence in TDEs. We model the ultraviolet (UV) and optical signatures of such disk instabilities, expected from the accretion power being reprocessed by the optically-thick outflow following super-Eddington accretion. Our model predicts brief UV-bright transients lasting for days, with luminosities of $10^{42}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in near-UV and $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in optical for a typical TDE by a $10^6~M_\odot$ black hole. These could be detectable by near-future surveys such as ULTRASAT, Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Argus Array, for TDEs of redshifts out to $\approx 0.1$. We further conduct a search for these transients in existing nearby TDEs using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, placing upper limits on the flare rate for each TDE of $1$-$2$ yr$^{-1}$ dependent on the outflow mass. In the era of future surveys, combined UV/optical and radio monitoring would be an important test to the disk instability phenomena, as well as its explanation for the late-time radio emission in TDEs.

### [18] [Measuring Pulsar Distances from Chirping Orbital Periods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15110)
*Brady Egleston,Reza Ebadi,Ronald Walsworth*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the orbital period derivatives of 21 millisecond binary pulsars to determine their distances, improving uncertainty for four. It highlights significant dependence on galactic acceleration models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To infer accurate distances to millisecond binary pulsars using orbital chirp data while accounting for galactic acceleration model effects.

Method: Analyzed orbital period time derivatives (chirp) incorporating gravitational wave emission, sky motion, and galactic acceleration effects using multiple galactic models.

Result: Obtained distances for 21 MSPs with reduced uncertainties for four, showing significant model-dependent variations for four pulsars.

Conclusion: Galactic acceleration models significantly impact distance measurements, necessitating careful model selection for precise pulsar distance estimates.

Abstract: The observed orbital period time derivative (or orbital "chirp") of a millisecond binary pulsar (MSP) encodes information about both the intrinsic properties of the binary system and its environment. Orbital chirp has contributions from intrinsic energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, kinematic effects due to motion in the plane of the sky, and dynamical effects due to galactic acceleration, with the latter two contributions depending on the MSP distance. We use orbital chirp data to infer distances to 21 MSPs; and for four of which we obtain smaller uncertainties than those reported in previous distance measurements. We incorporate multiple realistic galactic acceleration models to assess the sensitivity of the inferred distances to the choice of galactic gravitational potential, finding a significant dependence for four MSPs.

*János Takátsy,Lorenz Zwick,Pankaj Saini,Johan Samsing*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that moderate eccentricity in binary neutron stars enhances the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides, improving constraints on neutron star matter properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G-modes are sensitive probes of neutron star interiors but are hard to observe due to weak tidal coupling. This study aims to enhance their detectability through eccentric binary systems.

Method: Analyzes the impact of eccentricity on gravitational wave signals, focusing on phase shifts from eccentric harmonics and epicyclic resonances of g-mode tides.

Result: Eccentricities of 0.2-0.4 at 10Hz boost detectability over circular binaries by over 10x. Future Einstein Telescope could constrain all relevant models with such systems.

Conclusion: Eccentric binary NS systems offer a viable pathway to study neutron star matter via g-mode tides, enabling robust constraints with existing and future GW detectors.

Abstract: Dynamical tides can provide us vital information about the properties of neutron star (NS) matter. This is particularly true for g-modes, whose frequency and tidal coupling are highly sensitive to the composition of NSs, especially in their centers, where microphysical models are the least reliable. However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\mathrm{10Hz}\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope.

### [20] [Three-Dimensional Kinematics of the Oxygen-rich Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15165)
*Adele L. Plunkett,P. Frank Winkler,Knox S. Long,Dan Milisavljevic*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of radial velocities of ejecta knots in the oxygen-rich supernova remnant G292.0+1.8 reveals a bi-conical structure, indicating jet-like ejecta ejection from the supernova explosion, consistent with prior proper motion studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the supernova explosion by connecting radial velocities with proper motions, thereby mapping the spatial distribution of ejecta.

Method: Optical spectra from CTIO were used to measure radial velocities of 93 ejecta knots. Assuming undecelerated expansion, radial velocities were correlated with line-of-sight distances from the common center, complementing earlier proper motion analyses.

Result: The ejecta knots show a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting the presence of jets in the supernova explosion. This structure aligns with findings from other young core-collapse remnants.

Conclusion: The bi-conical morphology implies asymmetric ejecta ejection in core-collapse supernovae, supporting models where explosions involve jet-driven mechanisms.

Abstract: Studying the remnants of young core-collapse supernovae (SNe) can yield insight into the chemical composition of their progenitors and the geometry of the explosions. The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.1935). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta. This structure is similar to that seen in some other young core-collapse supernova remnants.

*Alexandra Kozyreva,Matteo Bugli,Alexey Mironov,Petr Baklanov*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the helium-rich superluminous supernova 2021bnw using hydrodynamic simulations, finding it was likely a core-collapse event of a massive star (≥61 solar masses) with magnetorotational effects, rather than a pulsational pair-instability supernova, powered by ejecta and circumstellar collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the powering mechanisms of superluminous supernovae beyond magnetar-driven models, specifically investigating the role of circumstellar material and massive progenitor stars in explaining observed light curves.

Method: The authors performed pseudo-bolometric light curve analysis of SLSN 2021bnw using STELLA hydrodynamics and radiative-transfer simulations, testing models with varying ejecta mass (15–22.5 M☉), 56Ni mass (1.7 M☉), energy (4 foe), and circumstellar matter collision (7 M☉).

Result: Best-fit models matched observations with 15–22.5 M☉ ejecta, 1.7 M☉ 56Ni, 4 foe energy, and 7 M☉ circumstellar collision. Early data explained by cooling of 0.5 M☉ shell with 0.7 foe energy. PPISN origin is excluded.

Conclusion: SLSN 2021bnw likely originated from a ≥61 M☉ progenitor via core-collapse with magnetorotational effects, demonstrating that some SLSNe require combinations of massive ejecta, radioactive decay, and circumstellar interaction rather than solely magnetars or PPISN.

Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) remain an intriguing topic in supernova (SN) transient astronomy. While the majority of SLSNe are shown to be explained by energy streaming from the newly born magnetar, there are others which are powered by different mechanisms. We analyse the pseudo-bolometric light curve of the nearby helium-rich SLSN 2021bnw. We built models and run hydrodynamics radiative-transfer simulations with STELLA. Our best-fit models include 15-22.5 Msun of ejecta enriched with 1.7 Msun of 56 Ni and carrying energy of 4 foe, and colliding w ith 7 Msun of circumstellar matter which match the observed light curve very well. The early data can be explained as cooling of an expanding shell with the mass of 0.5 Msun and kinetic energy of 0.7 foe. We tend to exclude a pulsational pair-instability (PPISN) origin for SLSN 2021bnw. Instead we conclude that SLSN 2021bnw was preferably a core-collapse explosion of a star with the initial mass of not less than 61 Msun aided by magnetorotational effects.

*Björn Eichmann,Silvia Salvatore,Santiago del Palacio,Giacomo Sommani,Crystal Mele,Patrik M. Veres,Julia Becker Tjus*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper uses a refined model to explain non-thermal features in NGC 1068 and NGC 7469, showing that the AGN corona's spatial extension varies with energy, challenging the notion of a unique corona boundary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of non-thermal features (like the mm-bump, γ-rays, and neutrinos) observed in Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies and resolve inconsistencies between corona size inferred from different messengers (radio vs. neutrinos).

Method: Employing a homogeneous steady-state model with stochastic acceleration, energy losses, γγ attenuation, and Bayesian parameter estimation via MCMC to constrain physical parameters while avoiding overfitting.

Result: NGC 1068's features are well-explained, but NGC 7469 requires conflicting corona sizes (Rc>100 vs Rc<10 Rs) depending on the messenger. This indicates corona size depends on energy, not a fixed boundary.

Conclusion: AGN corona's spatial structure is energy-dependent, necessitating future models to account for inhomogeneities for better understanding of multi-messenger observations.

Abstract: Multimessenger observation of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469 indicate a characteristic feature in the radio band (the so-called mm-bump) as well as indication of high-energy neutrinos by the AGN corona. Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $γ$-rays and neutrinos.
  We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $γγ$-pair attenuation of the escaping $γ$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.
  Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\rm c}>100\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\rm c}< 10\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Bhabha scattering in non-Hermitian QED at finite temperature using PT-symmetry, introducing an axial mass and vector-axial couplings, and derives thermal cross sections with constraints on the axial coupling constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the validity and implications of non-Hermitian QED frameworks (replacing Hermiticity with PT-symmetry) in high-energy scattering processes at finite temperatures, addressing key questions about physical observables' reality and system behavior under extreme conditions.

Method: Applied Thermofield Dynamics formalism to calculate thermal differential cross sections for Bhabha scattering in PT-symmetric non-Hermitian QED. Derived constraints on axial coupling constants by analyzing high-energy limits of scattering amplitudes.

Result: Established feasible ranges for axial coupling constants through cross section analysis and high-energy amplitude limits, demonstrating consistency with physical observables under PT-symmetric conditions at finite temperatures.

Conclusion: Non-Hermitian QED with PT-symmetry can provide viable frameworks for thermal field theories, offering new perspectives on particle interactions under extreme conditions without compromising observable reality through appropriate parameter constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Bhabha scattering process within the framework of non-Hermitian QED at finite temperature. In this theory, the hermiticity condition, typically required in quantum field theory to ensure the reality of physical observables, is replaced by the condition of unbroken $PT$-symmetry which favors the introduction of an axial mass and a vector-axial gauge coupling. Using the Thermofield Dynamics formalism, we derive and comprehensively analyze the thermal differential cross section for the Bhabha scattering. Furthermore, we explore the high-energy limit of the scattering amplitude and establish constraints upon the axial coupling constant, offering valuable insights into the system's behavior under extreme conditions.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the radiative decay φ → γπ⁰π⁰ using a dispersive framework incorporating strong final-state interactions involving f₀(500) and f₀(980) resonances. It employs a coupled-channel Muskhelishvili-Omnès approach, achieving a parameter-free prediction for kaon Born rescattering and validating the formalism through consistency with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of scalar resonances and final-state interactions in the φ → γπ⁰π⁰ decay, and to verify the consistency of dispersive methods with experimental data from KLOE and SND collaborations.

Method: A coupled-channel Muskhelishvili-Omnès framework was used, accounting for vector-meson exchanges and crossed-channel singularities. The study verified equivalence between modified and standard Omnès representations, applied a once-subtracted dispersion relation with left-hand cuts, and included two subtraction constants to fit data.

Result: The parameter-free prediction for kaon Born rescattering was achieved, showing it as dominant. The analysis confirmed consistency between φ decay data and other processes like ππ scattering and γγ fusion, validating the dispersive formalism and inputs for the Omnès matrix.

Conclusion: The dispersive approach successfully explains the φ → γπ⁰π⁰ decay dynamics, demonstrating reliability of the framework and inputs. This supports using such methods for future studies of strong interactions in radiative decays.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the radiative decay $φ\to γπ^0 π^0$ in a dispersive framework, where the two-pion subsystem undergoes strong final-state interactions that cover the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ regions. We employ a coupled-channel Muskhelishvili-Omnès framework that allows for a consistent treatment of two scalar resonances and crossed-channel singularities induced by the Born and vector-meson exchanges. We explicitly verify the equivalence between the modified and standard Muskhelishvili-Omnès representations for vector-meson pole contributions when the isoscalar Omnès matrix is chosen asymptotically bounded, and we adopt the standard representation in decay kinematics. This yields, for the first time, a parameter-free dispersive prediction for the kaon Born rescattering, which provides a dominant contribution. To obtain a good fit to the KLOE and SND data, we employ a once-subtracted coupled-channel dispersion relation with heavier left-hand cut contributions and two unknown subtraction constants. The results demonstrate the consistency among the data for $ππ$ scattering, $γγ$ fusion, and $φ$ radiative decay, thereby validating the underlying dispersive formalism and the input used for the hadronic Omnès matrix and left-hand cuts.

### [25] [The Sun Can Strongly Constrain Spin-Dependent Dark Matter Nucleon Scattering Below the Evaporation Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15113)
*Thong T. Q. Nguyen,Tim Linden*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines how dark matter evaporation and annihilation compete in the Sun, showing that solar observations can provide stronger constraints on spin-dependent cross-sections than terrestrial experiments for 2-4 GeV dark matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond the fixed 4 GeV evaporation limit assumption and accurately model the interplay between evaporation and annihilation for better understanding dark matter constraints.

Method: The authors analyze the competitive dynamics of dark matter evaporation (due to solar plasma collisions) and self-annihilation within the Sun, calculating how this competition affects spin-dependent nucleon cross-section limits.

Result: They find solar observations yield 1-5 orders of magnitude stricter limits than Earth-based experiments for 2-4 GeV dark matter annihilating to neutrinos or long-lived mediators.

Conclusion: Solar-based dark matter searches remain powerful tools even at low masses, requiring updated models beyond static evaporation thresholds.

Abstract: The Sun is a promising target for dark matter searches due to its ability to accumulate dark matter particles via scattering and catalyze their self-annihilation. However, at low dark matter masses, dark matter particles can also "evaporate" due to subsequent collisions with the hot thermal plasma of the Sun. While several modeling studies have calculated the competitive dynamics of dark matter evaporation and annihilation, observational studies have typically assumed a fixed 4 GeV "evaporation limit", below which dark matter evaporates before it can annihilate. In this paper, we carefully consider the competitive effects of dark matter evaporation and annihilation on the resulting spin-dependent dark matter nucleon cross-section limits, finding that Solar observations can continue to exceed terrestrial constraints by between 1-5 orders of magnitude for dark matter masses between 2-4 GeV for dark matter annihilation to both neutrinos and long-lived mediators.

### [26] [Excluding MeV-scale QCD axions by $K_L \to π^0π^0 a$ at KTeV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15117)
*Takaya Iwai,Ryosuke Sato,Kohsaku Tobioka,Takumu Yamanaka*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates a MeV-scale QCD axion's viability by analyzing kaon decay experiments, finding that existing bounds from KTeV and other experiments exclude the proposed axion mass window except under highly constrained conditions requiring significant cancellation of higher-order corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To re-examine the viability of a QCD axion with a mass near 10 MeV that couples to up quarks, down quarks, and electrons, by deriving new constraints from kaon decay measurements.

Method: Analysis of K_L → π⁰π⁰e⁺e⁻ data from KTeV, reinterpretation of K⁺ decay results from E949 and NA62 experiments to constrain axion decay modes, and evaluation of chiral Lagrangian uncertainties.

Result: Combined new and existing bounds exclude the MeV-scale axion scenario except in a tiny parameter space requiring three-order-of-magnitude suppression of K_L → π⁰π⁰a branching ratio through finely canceled higher-order effects.

Conclusion: The MeV-scale QCD axion model is tightly constrained; only an unlikely scenario with precise cancellation of higher-order terms avoids exclusion by current experimental limits.

Abstract: An interesting proposal suggests that a QCD axion $(a)$ coupling to the up quark, down quark, and electron remains viable for an axion mass near 10~MeV. In this paper, this possibility is reexamined by deriving new bounds from kaon decays. In particular, we perform a detailed analysis of the $K_L \to π^0 π^0 e^+ e^-$ measurement reported by the KTeV experiment, and reinterpret $K^+$ decay measurements at the E949 and NA62 experiments to constrain both the diphoton decay and effectively invisible decay modes of the axion. We find that, combined with the previously known bounds, the viable window for the MeV-scale QCD axion is excluded, primarily due to the KTeV bound. Uncertainties associated with the chiral Lagrangian are further examined, and the scenario remains excluded even after accounting for these uncertainties, except for a tiny region of parameter space where higher-order corrections must finely cancel the leading-order contribution, suppressing the branching ratio of $K_L\to π^0π^0 a$ by three orders of magnitude.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Dark Matter annihilation into SUEPs can produce significant antideuterons and antihelium-3, surpassing Standard Model predictions, with detectable signals in AMS-02 and GAPS experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Model predictions for antinuclei yields from cosmic-ray interactions or DM annihilations are too low compared to possible experimental observations. The paper explores if DM annihilating into a confining dark sector with SUEPs can enhance antinuclei production.

Method: Benchmark models with specific DM masses (~10 TeV), dark meson masses (~400 GeV), dominant tt̄ decays, and SUEP temperatures (~0.1×mπ_D) are analyzed. Simulations assess antinuclei production rates in AMS-02 and GAPS.

Result: DM-SUEP scenarios can generate tens of antideuterons and a few antihelium-3 events in AMS-02, and sub-threshold signals in GAPS. These signals exceed Standard Model expectations and depend sensitively on SUEP parameters.

Conclusion: Antinuclei detection by current/future experiments could signal hidden dark sector dynamics and constrain SUEP models, offering a pathway to test beyond-Standard-Model particle physics via cosmic-ray experiments.

Abstract: Standard-Model (SM) hadronic parton showers initiated by secondary cosmic-ray production or dark matter (DM) annihilations robustly predict very low antinuclei yields and a strong additional suppression for heavier antinuclei. We show that an important exception can arise if DM annihilates into a confining dark sector that produces Soft Unclustered Energy Patterns (SUEPs). The hallmark of SUEPs is the emission of very large multiplicities of soft dark mesons ($π_D$), which can overcome the usual phase-space suppression of antinuclei formation in parton showers, provided that the dark mesons decay promptly into SM quarks, i.e. within a SM hadronization length. We study several benchmark realizations and find that for DM masses $m_{\rm DM}\sim\mathcal{O}(10~\mathrm{TeV})$, dark meson masses $m_{π_D} \sim 400~\mathrm{GeV}$, $π_D$ dominantly decaying to $t\bar t$, and a SUEP temperature $T_{\rm SUEP}\simeq 0.1\,m_{πD}$, DM annihilation into SUEPs can yield tens of antideuterons and a few antihelium--3 events at AMS-02 at kinetic energies of $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{GeV}$/n) and a few antideuterons and antihelium-3 events in GAPS at energies below 0.5 GeV/n. A future confirmation of an antinuclei signal by the AMS-02 or GAPS experiments could provide hints for hidden confining dynamics and would significantly constrain the relevant SUEP parameters.

*Swagato Mukherjee,Vladimir V. Skokov,Andrey Tarasov,Shaswat Tiwari,Fei Yao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper derives the gluon transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) operator structure for back-to-back dijet production in deep inelastic scattering at twist-3 accuracy, valid at arbitrary Bjorken-x and beyond the high-energy eikonal limit. It connects to existing small-x results and reduces the operator basis using equations of motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend TMD analyses of dijet production beyond leading twist and provide a unified framework applicable at all Bjorken-x, bridging moderate- and small-x descriptions. Existing methods were limited to strict high-energy approximations, requiring a systematic approach valid at arbitrary x.

Method: Systematic gradient expansion of quark propagators in a background gluon field, organizing interactions via longitudinal Wilson lines and field-strength insertions. Cross sections calculated for both photon polarizations, identifying all twist-3 gluon TMD operators including F_+-, F_ij, and three-gluon correlators while retaining full Bjorken-x dependence.

Result: Explicit cross sections for longitudinally/transversely polarized virtual photons, identification of all contributing twist-3 gluon TMD operators, reproduction of known small-x results in the Color Glass Condensate limit, and reduction of operator basis through equations of motion.

Conclusion: Establishes a systematic TMD framework valid at arbitrary Bjorken-x, unifying descriptions across x regimes, and reduces nonperturbative matrix elements for practical application in future analyses.

Abstract: We derive the gluon transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) operator structure of back-to-back quark-antiquark dijet production in deep inelastic scattering at arbitrary Bjorken-x to twist-3 accuracy. Working at leading order in the strong coupling and in the kinematic regime where the transverse momentum imbalance of the jets is much smaller than their individual transverse momenta, we perform a systematic gradient expansion of the quark propagator in a background gluon field. This expansion organizes multiple interactions with the target in terms of longitudinal Wilson lines and gauge-invariant field-strength insertions, yielding a TMD description valid beyond the strict high-energy eikonal (x -> 0) approximation. We obtain explicit cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarized virtual photons, identifying all contributing gluon TMD operators up to twist-3, including structures involving F_+-, F_ij, and three-gluon correlators. The full longitudinal phase associated with Bjorken-x is retained throughout. In the small-x limit, our results reproduce the known sub-eikonal expressions obtained in the Color Glass Condensate framework, establishing a direct connection between the general-x TMD expansion and high-energy factorization. We further reduce the operator basis using equations of motion, minimizing the number of independent nonperturbative matrix elements entering the cross section. This work provides a systematic foundation for extending TMD analyses of dijet production beyond leading twist, establishing a unified operator framework valid at arbitrary Bjorken x that smoothly interpolates between moderate- and small-x descriptions of gluon TMDs.

TL;DR: The paper uses lattice QCD and Hamiltonian effective field theory to re-examine the controversial first positive parity nucleon resonance, distinguishing between quark model states and dynamically generated states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve debates surrounding the nature of the first positive parity excited nucleon resonance and clarify the distinction between quark model states and dynamically generated states.

Method: Lattice QCD calculations combined with Hamiltonian effective field theory to analyze the nucleon resonance's structure and origin.

Result: The study clarifies the resonance's classification by distinguishing whether it arises from a quark model configuration or dynamic interactions.

Conclusion: The approach provides a framework to better categorize baryon resonances, emphasizing the role of both theoretical models and dynamical generation mechanisms.

Abstract: Few baryon resonances have generated as much discussion, even controversy, as the first positive parity excited state with nucleon quantum numbers. We re-examine the issue using insight gained from lattice QCD, complemented by Hamiltonian effective field theory. In doing so, we also examine the distinction between a state that can be naturally described as a quark model state and one that is dynamically generated.

*Jing Zhao,Yongjie Deng,Tianbo Liu,Weihua Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework for electron-positron single-inclusive annihilation that includes twist-4 higher-twist contributions, improves descriptions of BESIII data at low-z, and highlights the need for higher-twist corrections in intermediate energy scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of leading-twist approximations in describing low-energy reactions by incorporating higher-twist effects and multi-parton correlators.

Method: A systematic collinear expansion of the hadronic tensor to derive structure functions using collinear FFs up to four-parton level, combined with a spectator model for twist-4 FF estimation and computation of π⁰ production cross sections.

Result: Numerical analysis shows that combining hadron mass corrections and twist-4 effects improves agreement with BESIII data at low z, and higher-twist effects dominate at intermediate Q-scales.

Conclusion: Standard leading-twist analyses must be extended with higher-twist corrections and multi-parton correlators for precise hadronization studies.

Abstract: We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for the electron-positron single-inclusive annihilation (SIA) process that incorporates higher-twist contributions up to twist-4 and demonstrate that these effects should be considered in low-energy reactions. Through a systematic collinear expansion of the hadronic tensor, we derive the complete set of structure functions in terms of collinear fragmentation functions (FFs), explicitly including multi-parton correlators up to the four-parton level. To evaluate the impact of these power corrections, we estimate the twist-4 unpolarized FF using a spectator model and compute the normalized differential cross section for $π^0$ production. Our numerical analysis reveals that the interplay between kinematic hadron mass corrections and dynamical twist-4 effects improves the theoretical description of recent BESIII data at relatively low-$z$ region. Furthermore, the $Q$-dependence confirms that higher-twist corrections are dominant at intermediate energy scales. These findings indicate that standard leading-twist global analyses must be extended to include these power corrections for precise studies of hadronization dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper reanalyzes Borexino Phase III data to estimate the high flux of geoantineutrinos and geoneutrinos from $^{40}$K, then models mantle convection accounting for the additional heat generated by this flux.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the heat generated by $^{40}$K could influence Earth's internal processes, particularly mantle convection.

Method: Reanalysis of Borexino Phase III data to quantify $^{40}$K neutrino flux, followed by geophysical modeling of mantle convection incorporating this heat source.

Result: The modeling shows that the excess $^{40}$K heat significantly affects mantle convection patterns, potentially explaining unexplained features in Earth's thermal history.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical role of $^{40}⁺$K in Earth's thermal budget, suggesting reassessment of models that neglect its contribution to internal heat dynamics.

Abstract: High flux of geoantineutrinos $^{40}$K and geoneutrinos $^{40}$K ($^{40}$K-geo-($\barν + ν$)) can be obtained from reanalysis of the Borexino Phase III data. Large amounts of $^{40}$K should produce a significant heat flow that should affect Earth's internal processes. We present the results of the modeling of mantle convection taking into account the excess heat from $^{40}$K.

### [32] [Residue-Enhanced Pion-Rho Mixing as the Origin of Nonmonotonic Charged Pion Mass in Magnetic Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15410)
*Ziyue Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explains the non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of the charged pion mass in lattice QCD through mixing with charged rho mesons due to quark-loop polarization and gauge-invariant operators, leading to level repulsion and residue suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the observed non-monotonic behavior of the charged pion mass in magnetic fields from lattice QCD simulations by identifying the underlying dynamical mechanism.

Method: Using a near-pole effective action from the SU(2) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, the authors analyze the mixing between charged pion and longitudinally polarized rho meson in magnetic fields. They consider quark-loop polarization effects and a tree-level operator related to vacuum decay processes, examining how these cause level repulsion and amplify effects through rho-meson wave function renormalization suppression near the pole.

Result: The analysis shows that mixing between charged pions and rho mesons, combined with suppressed rho-meson wave function renormalization, leads to a turnover in the charged pion's lower eigenmode mass as the magnetic field increases. This mechanism mirrors singlet-triplet mixing in positronium.

Conclusion: The non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of the charged pion mass arises naturally from symmetry-allowed meson mixing amplified by critical residue suppression near resonance poles, a phenomenon likely generalizable to other charged mesons in magnetic fields.

Abstract: We identify the dynamical origin of the non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of the charged pion mass observed in lattice QCD. Using a near-pole effective action derived from the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, we show that the lowest Landau level charged pion mixes with the longitudinally polarized charged rho meson, which shares the same quantum numbers in a magnetic background. This mixing, generated by quark-loop polarization and a gauge-invariant tree-level operator matched to the vacuum decay $ρ^\pm\rightarrowπ^\pmγ$, induces strong level repulsion. Crucially, this effect is dynamically amplified by a rapid suppression of the rho-meson wave function renormalization near the pole. As a result, the lower eigenmode exhibits a turnover as the magnetic field increases. The mechanism is analogous to singlet-triplet mixing in positronium and provides a natural explanation for the lattice results. Such effects are expected to be generic for charged mesons in magnetic fields when symmetry allowed mixing and near-pole residue suppression are present.

*Arnab Chaudhuri,Kousik Loho*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates how the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a hot thermal plasma affects gravitational wave production, showing thermal effects alter evaporation history and spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To account for thermal interactions between PBHs and their early Universe plasma environment, which previous studies neglect, to accurately model stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds.

Method: A thermal evaporation framework where ambient plasma modifies black hole decay rates, causing enhanced early mass loss and altered evaporation timelines compared to vacuum evaporation.

Result: Thermal effects significantly impact the timing and spectrum of gravitational waves from PBHs, providing a new framework for analyzing their observable signatures.

Conclusion: Thermal considerations are crucial for future studies of gravitational wave signals from PBHs, establishing a foundation for observational analyses.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe evaporate via Hawking radiation and constitute a generic source of stochastic gravitational waves. Existing studies of gravitational wave production from evaporating PBHs typically assume vacuum evaporation, neglecting the fact that PBHs in the early Universe are embedded in a hot thermal plasma. In this work, we investigate gravitational wave production from primordial black holes whose evaporation is thermally influenced by their surrounding environment. We adopt a thermal evaporation framework in which interactions with the ambient plasma modify the effective decay rate of the black hole, leading to enhanced mass loss at early times and a redistribution of the evaporation history compared to the standard non-thermal vacuum case. Since graviton emission is intrinsically tied to the evaporation history of PBHs, these thermal effects play a crucial role in determining the timing and spectral properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. Our results provide a consistent framework for incorporating thermal effects into gravitational wave production from evaporating primordial black holes and set the stage for a detailed analysis of their observational signatures.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the radiation of two distinguishable soft quark-antiquark pairs in QCD multiparton scattering, deriving soft currents and color interactions including dipole/tripole structures and C-violating effects. It also extends analysis to QED with lepton and mixed emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand color dynamics and charge asymmetry in multiparton scattering processes through analysis of soft quark-antiquark pair emissions, and to explore effects in both QCD and QED contexts.

Method: Evaluated tree-level soft currents for $m qar{q}Qar{Q}$ emission, decomposing into independent-emission and correlated components (non-abelian/abelian terms). Derived color dipole/tripole interactions from squared currents, then extended to include QED interactions and mixed emissions.

Result: Identified charge-conjugation-odd color tripole interactions causing charge asymmetry, and showed that dipole/tripole structures parallel those from soft gluon emissions. Demonstrated extension to QED emissions with distinguishable lepton pairs.

Conclusion: Soft quark-antiquark pair radiation provides a rich framework for studying color dynamics and C-violating effects, with extensions to QED offering opportunities for experimental verification of predicted charge asymmetries in high-energy scattering processes.

Abstract: We consider the radiation of two distinguishable soft quark-antiquark pairs ($\mathrm{q}\bar{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{Q}\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$) in a generic process for multiparton hard scattering in QCD. We evaluate the corresponding soft current at tree level in terms of an independent-emission contribution and an irreducible correlation component, which includes strictly non-abelian terms and also terms with an abelian character. The squared current for soft $\mathrm{q}\bar{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{Q}\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$ emission produces colour dipole and colour tripole interactions between the hard-scattering partons, with structures similar to soft gluon-quark-antiquark emission. The colour tripole interactions are odd under charge conjugation and lead to charge asymmetry effects. We extend our analysis by including QED interactions, the emission of two distinguishable soft lepton-antilepton pairs, and mixed quark-antiquark-lepton-antilepton soft emission.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve a consistent theoretical description of quark hadronization across light and heavy mesons by resolving fragmentation processes and momentum fraction distribution.

Method: Uses cut diagrams with Poincaré covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions and quark propagators. Derives 25 coupled jet equations to model sequential meson emissions in fragmentation cascades.

Result: Produced comprehensive fragmentation functions covering both light (pion/kaon) and heavy (D/D_s meson) sectors, providing unified framework for quark-to-hadron momentum transfer analysis.

Conclusion: The derived equations and functions successfully unify light and heavy quark hadronization descriptions, offering improved precision for collider experiments analyzing jet substructure and meson production.

Abstract: Quark fragmentation functions describe the hadronization process of a quark where any of the final-state hadrons carries a fraction of its initial momentum. We compute these fragmentation functions for a cascade that includes pions, kaons, and the charmed $D$ and $D_s$ mesons, starting from the elementary quark-to-meson fragmentation process. The latter is obtained from the relevant cut diagram, and employs Poincaré covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions and quark propagators. We derive a set of twenty-five coupled jet equations that describe the cascade of emitted mesons in the fragmentation process. Their solutions yield full fragmentation functions that offer a consistent picture of the quark fragmentations across the light and heavy sectors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We explore combinations of particle and anti-particle yields which can be used to test thermal models in a parameter free way. We also explore combinations which can be used to extract $μ_B/T$, $μ_S/T$ and $μ_Q/T$. We use experimentally measured particle-antiparticle specific ratios for proton $p$, $Λ$, and cascade $Ξ$, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 7.7-39 GeV from RHIC BES phase-1 to extract the $μ_{B,S,Q}/T$. These compared well with published STAR freeze-out parameters. These combinations are verified to predict a similar combination of $Ω$ and $\overlineΩ$ yields. We also extend this idea to predict (anti-)nuclei yields at energies where they are not measured. We also update parametrizations for the $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ dependence of freeze-out parameters $T$ and $μ_B$, and present for the first time a similar parametrization of $μ_S$.

*Haruto Masubuchi,Yuma Narita,Wen Yin*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study reveals that in low-energy single-field inflation models, a tachyonic instability leads to a first-order phase transition, generating gravitational waves detectable by current and future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio suggest inflation's energy scale may be below the grand-unified theory (GUT) scale. This motivated the exploration of post-inflation dynamics in such low-scale models.

Method: Analyzing a class of single-field inflation models with small energy scales to study the development and effects of tachyonic instabilities post-inflation, including nonlinear dynamics and phase transition mechanisms.

Result: Tachyonic instabilities cause rapid nonlinear dynamics, creating shock waves and gravitational waves. These signals are observable via gravitational wave detectors like pulsar timing arrays and LIGO, with existing LIGO data constraining EeV-scale inflation.

Conclusion: Low-scale inflation scenarios differ significantly from high-scale models in post-inflation dynamics. Detectable gravitational wave signatures allow testing these models, with pulsar timing arrays potentially indicating GeV-scale inflation.

Abstract: Current bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio imply that the energy scale of inflation may lie below the grand-unified scale. In this paper, we show that in a broad class of single-field inflation models with sufficiently small energy scales, an extremely efficient tachyonic instability develops at the end of inflation. This instability rapidly drives the system into a nonlinear regime before coherent oscillations can be established, leading to a first-order phase-transition--like phenomenon without tunneling or barrier crossing. The resulting ultra-relativistic shock fronts surrounding the bubble interiors expand to near the Hubble scale, corresponding to the most strongly enhanced tachyonic modes, and collide with one another, producing energetic inflaton particles and gravitational waves. As a result, the post-inflationary dynamics can differ significantly from the conventional high-scale inflationary scenario. Interestingly, inflation at MeV--EeV energy scales can be probed via gravitational-wave observations, including pulsar timing arrays, ground-based detectors, and future space-based experiments. Recent limits from the LIGO--KAGRA--Virgo collaboration already constrain EeV-scale inflation, while pulsar timing array results may be interpreted as evidence for gravitational waves generated by GeV-scale inflation. We also briefly discuss further implications of the resulting tachyonic shocks.

Motivation: To address rapid archive growth, complex new instruments, and expanding user expectations, requiring faster queries, better data management tools, and integrated visualization capabilities.

Method: Implemented Plotly-Dash for user interfaces, R-tree spatial indexing for faster spatial searches, VO-compliant TAP middleware for interoperability, and mViewer for image visualization. Deployed real-time data ingestion and developed two beta services.

Result: Delivered a 20x speed improvement in spatial searches, real-time data management interfaces, and two functional beta services (Data Discovery Service and protostar notebook) demonstrating the new infrastructure's capabilities.

Conclusion: The new infrastructure improves archive usability and accessibility, enabling efficient querying, visualization, and integration with external data sources, poised to replace the existing system upon completion.

Abstract: The Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) curates all observational data acquired at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The archive is expected to grow rapidly as complex new instruments are commissioned and as the expectations of archive users have expanded. In response, KOA has implemented a new Python-based, VO-compliant query infrastructure. This work is a continuation of the architectural design and technology selection identified at ADASS 2024. We have deployed real-time ingestion of newly acquired data and a dedicated interface for observers to manage these data. Our ADASS 2024 poster identified the new technologies chosen: Plotly-Dash, a low-code framework that exploits event-driven callbacks to simplify the handling of user interactions; R-tree spatial indexing to speed up spatial searches by x20; a VO-compliant TAP middleware, already in use at the NASA Exoplanet Archive and NEID archive; and mViewer, a visualization engine in the Montage Image Mosaic toolkit that is optimized for astronomy images.
  These technologies will underpin new services that can be hosted on web pages or in Jupyter notebooks, and when completed, will replace the current query infrastructure. We have completed two new services now in beta release. The first is the Data Discovery Service, a web-based dashboard that returns spatial and temporal queries of the entire archive in seconds. It supports filtering observations by keywords, previewing results in an interactive data grid, and visualizing images, and it offers data downloads. The second is a Jupyter notebook that performs interactive visualization of Keck observations of protostars in the Rho Oph Dark Cloud and uses data from CDS and IRSA, as well as KOA.

TL;DR: The paper presents GW-FALCON, a feature-driven DL framework for early detection of BNS/NSBH inspirals in next-gen GW detectors like ET and CE. By using extracted features from short time windows, it achieves high classification accuracy for early warnings to enable EM follow-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable systematic early-warning alerts for BNS and NSBH inspirals in next-gen GW observatories to facilitate rapid electromagnetic follow-up, leveraging the high SNR and long duration of signals.

Method: GW-FALCON extracts statistical/temporal/spectral features using TSFEL from short strain data segments, then uses feed-forward ANNs for classification. Trained on partial-inspiral data with varying max frequencies, allowing early triggers tens to hundreds of seconds before merger.

Result: Classifiers achieved ~90% accuracy for ET-like and >97% for CE-like detectors at low false alarms. First comprehensive feature-based DL framework for next-gen GW early detection.

Conclusion: GW-FALCON offers robust early detection capability for GW observatories, adaptable to real data and scalable architectures. Provides foundation for integrating feature-extraction with DL in GW signal classification.

Abstract: Next-generation GW observatories such as the ET and CE will detect BNS and NSBH inspirals with high SNRs and long in-band durations, making systematic early-warning alerts both feasible and scientifically valuable. Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.

### [41] [A Response to paper Critical Evaluation of Studies Alleging Evidence for Technosignatures in the POSS1-E Photographic Plates by Watters et al. (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15171)
*Beatriz Villarroel,Alina Streblyanska,Stephen Bruehl,Stefan Geier*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The authors defend their previous studies against Watters et al.'s critique by highlighting methodological flaws, including improper subset filtering, lack of statistical power, inadequate error analysis, and geometric inconsistencies in plate assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and refute the validity of Watters et al.'s criticisms by exposing flaws in their methodology that undermine their conclusions.

Method: The authors critique the critique by analyzing Watters' subset selection (its filtering process, reduced size, and missing temporal data), pointing out the exclusion of cos(Dec) factor affecting data integrity, and noting absence of uncertainty estimates in their statistical analyses.

Result: The critique from Watters et al. is found to be methodologically flawed, with their subset leading to underpowered tests and unreliable conclusions. The original findings of Villarroel et al. remain valid.

Conclusion: The original studies are not invalidated; Watters' approach contains significant methodological shortcomings that limit its credibility.

Abstract: We respond to the critique by Watters et al. (2026) of the statistical analyses in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl & Villarroel (2025). We argue that the critique conflates object-level validation with ensemble-level statistical inference and relies on a reduced, heterogeneously filtered subset originally constructed for a different scientific purpose. We further question whether the aggressively filtered subset used in Watters et al. (2026) demonstrates a meaningful improvement in sample purity, given the twenty-fold reduction in sample size. Our simple, visual check does not suggest that it does. The subset further lacks complete temporal information and is seriously statistically underpowered for testing the reported Earth-shadow deficit. We emphasise that the horizontal separation metric used for plate assignment and time reconstruction as in Watters et al. (2026) depends on the inclusion of the cos(Dec) factor to ensure geometric consistency. Any omission would alter plate assignment and inferred observation times. Moreover, the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026) do not include uncertainty estimates or error propagation, limiting the interpretability of the claimed null results. We conclude that the principal findings reported in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl & Villarroel (2025) are not invalidated by the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026).

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper uses GPS atomic clock data to search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) from the GW170817 neutron-star merger, testing for dispersive anti-chirp signals. No significant signal was found, but constraints on interaction energy scales were improved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new physics beyond standard models by detecting ELFs emitted during GW170817 merger using GPS clocks, complementing gravitational and electromagnetic observations in multi-messenger astronomy.

Method: Analyzed archival GPS carrier phase data from 18 Rb satellite clocks, creating network-median pseudo-frequency data. Conducted a template-bank search varying ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency.

Result: No statistically significant ELF signal detected. Derived 95% confidence lower bounds on $\Lambda_\alpha$ interaction energy scale, improving limits across 10^-18 to 10^-14 eV ELF energy range.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that existing satellite-clock networks can retrospectively search for new physics using archival timing data, offering a novel observational capability in multi-messenger astronomy.

Abstract: The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes a continuously operating, planet-scale network of atomic clocks that, beyond navigation and time dissemination, enables precision tests of fundamental physics. Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $Λ_α$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant. These limits improve upon existing astrophysical and gravity-test constraints across the ELF-energy range $\approx10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that mature global satellite-clock networks provide an observational capability for retrospective, multi-messenger searches for new physics using decades of archival timing data.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper describes the development and testing of a focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) technique for slow focus tracking in the Keck I telescope, comparing three algorithms (Gerchberg-Saxton, LiFT, Gaussian fit) and selecting Gerchberg-Saxton as the most effective for on-sky deployment, with potential applications to future large telescopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow focus error caused by sodium layer altitude drifts in LGS-based AO systems, which requires NGS compensation. The goal was to improve sky coverage and reduce lag errors by enabling higher-frequency slow focus tracking without an NGS.

Method: Three FPWFS algorithms (GS, LiFT, Gf) were developed and tested through numerical simulations and bench/on-sky data from Keck in 2025. Performance was evaluated based on linearity, computational cost, and robustness to low SNR/residuals.

Result: Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) was identified as the optimal algorithm, successfully compensating focus errors even during high turbulence on-sky tests. The method can be extended to other large telescopes (8-40m class).

Conclusion: FPWFS using GS improves AO system performance by eliminating the need for NGS for slow focus correction, enhancing telescope sky coverage and reducing lag error. The approach is scalable to next-generation telescopes.

Abstract: Laser guide stars (LGSs) have been deployed for the last 20-30 years in ground-based astronomical telescopes to overcome the limited sky coverage of classical adaptive optics (AO) systems. Unfortunately, slow altitude drifts of the sodium layer compromise focus measurements, generating the so-called slow focus error, and, consequently, a natural guide star (NGS) is needed to compensate for that error. Our goal is to develop and operationalize a focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) technique for slow focus tracking for the Keck I telescope, which can significantly increase sky coverage and allow slow focus tracking at higher frequencies, reducing the lag error. We develop, characterize, and compare three different FPWFS algorithms, namely Gerchberg-Saxton (GS), linearized focal plane technique (LiFT), and Gaussian fit (Gf). These algorithms were studied for the specific purpose of slow focus sensing in the NIR (H and K bands) using numerical simulations and data collected at Keck in 2025 (bench and on-sky). The three algorithms were studied and characterized against different criteria such as linearity, computational costs, and resistance to low signal-to-noise ratio and/or residuals. From the results obtained, the main candidate for an on-sky deployment was GS. On-sky tests showed promising results, with GS successfully compensating for purposely introduced focus errors, even under the presence of high turbulence conditions. This work can also be extrapolated to other existing 8-10 m class telescopes, or even future 30-40 m class telescopes, where the use of FPWFS can significantly improve sky coverage and reduce the lag error.

### [44] [Deep Learning for Point Spread Function Modeling in Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15780)
*Dayana Andrea Henao Arbeláez,Pierre-François Léget,Andrés Alejandro Plazas Malagón*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel AI-based PSF model that outperforms the current PIFF method by using a hybrid deep-learning autoencoder and Gaussian process approach, achieving lower reconstruction error and improving spatial coherence for weak-lensing analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PSF modeling is critical for weak gravitational lensing studies to avoid biases in cosmic shear measurements. PIFF's limitation of losing spatial coherence across CCDs necessitates a more coherent, high-accuracy model.

Method: A hybrid framework combining an autoencoder trained on HSC stellar images with a Gaussian process for cross-CCD interpolation, addressing PIFF's spatial coherence issue.

Result: The model achieves a reconstruction error of 3.4e-6, superior to PIFF's 3.7e-6. It provides improved PSF modeling for upcoming LSST surveys.

Conclusion: This hybrid model represents a significant step forward in PSF estimation, enhancing precision for cosmological studies and setting the stage for integration into LSST pipelines.

Abstract: We present the development of a data-driven, AI-based model of the Point Spread Function (PSF) that achieves higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art approach, "PSF in the Full Field-of-View'' (PIFF). PIFF is widely used in leading weak-lensing surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the "blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines.
