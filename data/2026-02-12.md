### [1] [Pushing the Limits of Atomic Dark Matter: First-Principles Recombination Rates and Cosmological Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10197)
*Jared Barron,Rouven Essig,Megan H. McDuffie,Jesús Pérez-Ríos,Gregory Suczewski*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores atomic dark matter models across a broad parameter space using CMB and other cosmological data to constrain their viability, focusing on how dark sector dynamics affect early universe physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of atomic dark matter on small-scale structures and early cosmology by moving beyond the standard benchmark scenarios and analyzing recombination and cooling processes comprehensively.

Method: The study investigates dark matter composed of two fermions under a U(1)_D gauge interaction, simulating their recombination into neutral states and analyzing CMB constraints from Planck, ACT, BAO, and Pantheon+ data across mass and coupling parameter spaces.

Result: New constraints on atomic dark matter parameters are derived, highlighting regions where dark sector interactions leave detectable signatures in the CMB through acoustic oscillation damping and recombination effects.

Conclusion: Atomic dark matter models must adhere to strict observational constraints from CMB data, with specific parameter ranges remaining viable. Future surveys can further test these models by probing their imprint on cosmological observables.

Abstract: Minimal atomic dark matter with its distinctive cooling mechanisms offers an instructive framework for understanding the potential impact of dark matter on small-scale structure formation and early cosmology. The model consists of two fermions with opposite charges under a hidden Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)_{D}$ and masses $m_{p_{D}}$ and $m_{e_{D}}$, respectively. Analogous to hydrogen in the Standard Model, these fermions interact via their own electromagnetic-like force, with a dark fine structure constant denoted by $α_{D}$, and can bind into neutral atomic (and molecular) dark states. Previous work has largely focused on the benchmark scenario where the dark sector mirrors ordinary matter, with $m_{e_{D}}$ near the electron mass, $m_{p_{D}}$ near the proton mass, and $α_{D}\sim 1/137$. We extend this analysis by investigating dark recombination and cooling physics across the full parameter space of masses and couplings. Combining Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck and ACT with BAO and Pantheon+ data, we place new constraints on the atomic dark matter parameter space, identifying regions where acoustic damping and recombination dynamics leave observable imprints on the CMB.

### [2] [A Comprehensive Study on Top Quark FCNC Interactions in SMEFT Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10201)
*Subhajit Kala,Soumitra Nandi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a model-independent analysis of top quark FCNC interactions using SMEFT, incorporating multiple experimental constraints to set limits on couplings and Wilson coefficients, and provides predictions for future collider searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively study rare top quark FCNC processes without relying on specific models, leveraging existing experimental data to constrain coupling parameters and guide future experiments.

Method: Parametrization of top-FCNC couplings in SMEFT, matching to the operator basis, global analysis combining flavour observables, electroweak data, Higgs measurements, and EDM limits, treating dipole operators as complex to constrain both real and imaginary components.

Result: Strong constraints on left/right-handed FCNC couplings, especially from neutron EDM on t→u transitions; derived bounds on SMEFT Wilson coefficients, predictions for branching ratios/CP asymmetries, and benchmark scenarios for collider experiments.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the necessity of considering CP-violating effects in top quark FCNC studies and highlights the effectiveness of combining diverse datasets to constrain BSM physics, guiding future searches at colliders.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive, model-independent analysis of rare flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions of the top quark within an effective field theory framework. Beginning with a general parametrisation of top-FCNC couplings, we match these interactions onto the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operator basis at the top-quark scale. We then perform a global study that incorporates constraints from low-energy flavour observables, electroweak precision data, Higgs and gauge-boson measurements, and electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. By treating the dipole operators as complex, we derive stringent limits on both the real and imaginary components of left- and right-handed FCNC couplings. In particular, we show that constraints from the neutron EDM impose especially strong bounds on products of FCNC couplings involving the transition $t \to u$. Translating these results into the SMEFT framework, we obtain robust constraints on several products of the corresponding SMEFT Wilson coefficients. Finally, we provide predictions for branching ratios and CP asymmetries in rare top-quark FCNC decays. We identify well-motivated benchmark scenarios for future collider searches and emphasise the crucial role of CP-violating effects in probing the flavour structure of the top quark.

### [3] [Gravitational scalar production with a generic reheating scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10215)
*Francesco Costa,Jinsu Kim*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gravitational production of decoupled scalars during inflation and post-inflation phases, exploring constraints on scalar properties under different reheating scenarios. It finds that reheating dynamics critically affect these constraints, with k < 4 scenarios allowing viable non-thermal dark matter due to dilution, while k > 4 cases face stricter limits. Multi-stage reheating effects factorize.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address over-production of decoupled scalars caused by gravitational effects during early universe phases and determine under what conditions non-thermal dark matter scenarios remain viable.

Method: The study uses theoretical analysis of gravitational scalar production in various reheating models, including power-law inflaton potentials (V ∝ φ^k) and multi-stage reheating. Constraints are derived on scalar self-coupling (λ_s), mass (m_s), and quantum gravity operators.

Result: Constraints on scalar parameters depend sensitively on reheating dynamics. For k < 4 with low reheating temperatures, extended reheating phases dilute relics, preserving predictivity. For k > 4, relic abundance increases during reheating, imposing stricter constraints. Multi-stage reheating effects independently multiply.

Conclusion: Universal gravitational effects don't universally invalidate non-thermal dark matter models; viable scenarios exist depending on reheating parameters. Multi-stage reheating impacts factor into separate contributions.

Abstract: Gravitational production of decoupled scalars during inflationary and post-inflationary phases is efficient and can lead to over-production. We study this production with various reheating scenarios such as a generic power-law inflaton potential $V_{\rm inf}\propto φ^k$ as well as a multi-stage reheating scenario. We derive constraints on the scalar self-interaction coupling $λ_s$, the mass $m_s$, and coefficients of quantum gravity-induced operators. We find that the constraints depend sensitively on the reheating dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that universal gravity effects do not necessarily spoil the predictivity of non-thermal dark matter scenarios with $k < 4$ and low reheating temperatures, as an extended reheating phase dilutes gravitationally-produced relics. For $k > 4$, on the other hand, the relic abundance is enhanced during the reheating phase, leading to stringent constraints on the scalar. In multi-stage reheating, we show that the enhancement/dilution effect of subsequent reheating phases factorises.

### [4] [The complete three-loop unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements and asymptotic Wilson coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10334)
*J. Ablinger,A. Behring,J. Blümlein,A. De Freitas,A. von Manteuffel,C. Schneider,K. Schönwald*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper details the completion of three-loop calculations for massive operator matrix elements and Wilson coefficients in the context of deep-inelastic scattering, providing numerical tools for QCD analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance precision calculations in QCD by extending the theoretical framework for massive contributions in deep-inelastic scattering, enabling more accurate comparisons with experimental data.

Method: The authors compute three-loop unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements with single- and two-mass corrections. They also derive numerical representations for massless Wilson coefficients, splitting functions, and target-mass corrections optimized for computational efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Complete three-loop results for massive operator matrix elements and associated Wilson coefficients in the high-energy limit. Numerical tools are provided for direct application in QCD-fitting frameworks.

Conclusion: These results enhance the theoretical precision of QCD analysis, particularly for processes involving heavy quarks, and provide essential input for high-precision experimental data interpretation.

Abstract: We report on the three-loop unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements, with single- and two-mass corrections, and the associated deep-inelastic massive Wilson coefficients in the region $Q^2 \gg m_Q^2$, the calculation of which has been completed recently. We also provide fast and precise numerical representations of the massless Wilson coefficients, splitting functions to tree-loop order, and target-mass corrections in $x$-space well suited for QCD-fitting codes.

### [5] [Manipulating Bell nonlocality and entanglement in polarized electron-positron annihilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10389)
*Hong-Wei Zhang,Xu Cao,Tai-Fu Feng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the polarization of lepton beams affects quantum correlations (Bell nonlocality and entanglement) in hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced via electron-positron annihilation, using CHSH parameters, concurrence, and negativity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between lepton beam polarization and quantum correlations in high-energy particle systems, offering new insights into hyperon pair production and charmonium decay processes.

Method: Theoretical analysis and numerical calculations based on the joint spin density matrix of the YȲ system. Calculated responses of CHSH parameter, concurrence, and negativity to polarization degrees, comparing effects from longitudinal vs transverse beam polarization.

Result: Found distinct influences of longitudinal and transverse polarization on entanglement measures. These results provide alternative perspectives for understanding charmonium decay into hyperon pairs.

Conclusion: Beam polarization significantly manipulates quantum correlations in high-energy systems, with potential implications for experimental design in charmonium decay studies and quantum information applications.

Abstract: The hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in electron-positron annihilation as a massive two-qubit quantum system can be used to study the quantum correlations at high energies. This paper is theoretically dedicated to how polarization of lepton beams manipulate the Bell nonlocality and entanglement of hyperon pairs system. The response of CHSH parameter, concurrence, and negativity to the polarization degree is numerically calculated by exploiting the joint spin density matrix of $Y\bar{Y}$ system. Different influences of longitudinal and transverse polarization of beams on entanglement are found and compared. The results provide alternative perspectives for the decay of charmoniun to hyperon pairs.

### [6] [Entanglement redistribution of hyperon-antihyperon pair via sequential decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10398)
*Cong Li,Xu Cao,Ai-Qiang Guo,Chun-Xu Yu,Hong-Wei Zhang,Zhe Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the behavior of quantum entanglement and quantum discord in hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in electron-positron annihilation. It shows that while entanglement may decrease but not vanish during sequential decays, quantum discord can still increase, highlighting the role of hyperon polarization in redistributing entanglement within phase space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how quantum entanglement and quantum discord evolve during the decay processes of hyperon-antihyperon pairs, addressing previous findings on autodistillation and establishing bounds on entanglement loss/gain.

Method: The study uses the explicit spin density matrix of baryon pairs to analyze entanglement measures (concurrence, negativity) and quantum discord, examining their behavior across sequential decay stages.

Result: Entanglement (measured by concurrence/negativity) is found to have a lower boundary (doesn't disappear) and redistributes via hyperon polarization effects. Quantum discord, however, can increase even when entanglement doesn't.

Conclusion: Hyperon-antihyperon systems exhibit complex quantum correlations where entanglement is partially preserved and redistributed, while quantum discord may enhance, indicating the necessity to consider multiple quantum correlation measures for such systems.

Abstract: Hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in high energy electron-positron annihilation constitute a naturally spin-entangled system in the high energy regime. Recently, a probabilistic amplification of entanglement, termed autodistillation, has been found in the daughter baryon-antibaryon pairs from hyperon decay and is constrained by an upper boundary. This work demonstrates that the quantum entanglement in this process may be accompanied by a decrease, constrained by a lower boundary, but will not be completely lost. Thus, the entanglement of these systems undergoes redistribution within the phase space during the sequential decays of hyperons, and an important role of hyperon polarization is highlighted. By using the explicit spin density matrix of baryon pairs, it is also found that quantumness of the system characterized by quantum discord always have the possibility to increase during decay processes, even when entanglement evaluated by concurrence and negativity does not increase.

### [7] [Unidentified falling objects in the LHC as dark matter signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10562)
*Xunyu Liang,Ariel Zhitnitsky*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the possibility that UFOs (Unidentified Falling Objects observed in LHC operations) could be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), a type of dark matter. AQNs, consisting of matter or antimatter, might interact with the LHC when passing nearby, generating acoustic waves that trigger beam losses. The study suggests the LHC could act as a detector for these particles by analyzing correlated UFO events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate an alternative explanation for UFOs beyond the current dust particle hypothesis, proposing AQNs as a dark matter candidate that also addresses cosmological puzzles like the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry.

Method: Simulations of AQN interactions with the LHC environment, calculating acoustic wave generation from antimatter AQNs encountering Earth's matter. Statistical analysis of UFO event correlations and signal-to-noise ratios under different AQN mass scenarios.

Result: Antimatter AQNs within 100km of the LHC can induce multiple UFOs within 2 seconds. Detecting three correlated UFOs over 360 hours could achieve a signal-to-noise ratio >5, covering all plausible AQN masses.

Conclusion: The LHC's existing beam loss monitors can function as a novel, large-scale acoustic detector for AQNs, offering a new pathway to search for dark matter and probe cosmological particle physics models.

Abstract: Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs) refer to sporadic beam losses observed during LHC operation. The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($Ω_\mathrm{DM}\simΩ_\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs.

### [8] [Structural dissection of hadronic molecules: The $D^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ family under QCD light-cone sum rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10638)
*Ulaş Özdem*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the static electromagnetic properties of three charm-strange molecular tetraquark candidates (D̄K*, D*̄K, D*̄K*) with J⁺=1 using QCD light-cone sum rules. Magnetic moments (1-3 nuclear magnetons) and small electric quadrupole moments (~10⁻³ fm²) are predicted, showing light quarks dominate the magnetic response. Results aid in distinguishing molecular configurations from compact multiquark states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate electromagnetic properties of charm-strange tetraquark candidates to understand their molecular structure and differentiate them from compact multiquark interpretations, providing benchmarks for future experiments.

Method: Used QCD light-cone sum rules with interpolating currents from color-singlet meson bilinears. Included both perturbative and non-perturbative photon contributions to calculate magnetic and electric quadrupole moments.

Result: Magnetic moments range 1-3 nuclear magnetons (highest in D*̄K system), quadrupole moments ~10⁻³ fm² indicating spherical charge distributions. Light quarks dominate magnetic response, charm quark contribution is suppressed.

Conclusion: Results offer quantitative data to discriminate between molecular and multiquark interpretations of exotic hadrons, guiding experimental studies on charm-strange states' electromagnetic signatures.

Abstract: We investigate the static electromagnetic properties of three charm--strange molecular tetraquark candidates with quantum numbers $J^{P}=1^{+}$, namely the $D\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $D^{\ast}\bar{K}$, and $D^{\ast}\bar{K}^{\ast}$ systems. The analysis is carried out within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules, using interpolating currents constructed from colour-singlet meson bilinears to reflect their molecular configurations. Both perturbative and non-perturbative photon contributions are included,and numerical predictions for the magnetic and electric quadrupole moments are obtained. The magnetic moments are found to lie in the range $1$--$3$ nuclear magnetons, with the largest value associated with the $D^{*}\bar{K}$ configuration. The quadrupole moments are an order of magnitude smaller, of order $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{fm}^{2}$, indicating only weak deviations from spherical charge distributions. A flavour decomposition shows that the magnetic response is dominated by the light quarks, while the charm-quark contribution is strongly suppressed, a feature naturally expected for loosely bound hadronic molecules. The present analysis extends QCD light-cone sum-rule studies of exotic hadrons by providing a systematic determination of the electromagnetic moments of the $D^{(\ast)}\bar K^{(\ast)}$ molecular systems. These results provide quantitative benchmarks that may help discriminate between molecular configurations and more compact multiquark interpretations and may offer useful guidance for future experimental studies of electromagnetic signatures of charm--strange exotic states.

### [9] [A fast Bayesian surrogate for the photon flux in ultra-peripheral collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10692)
*Simone Ragoni,Janet Seger*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based surrogate model to efficiently compute the Equivalent Photon Approximation (EPA) flux in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), reducing computational time by two orders of magnitude. The model accounts for experimental uncertainties in neutron skin thickness and surface diffuseness, offering a modular framework for future analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of traditional methods for calculating EPA flux in UPCs and to effectively propagate uncertainties from nuclear parameters like neutron skin thickness and surface diffuseness.

Method: A Bayesian neural network trained using an iterative procedure focusing on regions with high relative uncertainties in analytical flux integrals. The training minimizes the number of integrations required while incorporating experimentally available uncertainties.

Result: The BNN surrogate achieves a two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in CPU time compared to conventional methods, enabling rapid propagation of updated nuclear priors and uncertainty assessment in UPC photon flux analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed surrogate model provides an efficient and flexible tool for UPC flux calculations, facilitating faster and more accurate analyses by dynamically integrating experimental uncertainties and allowing easy updates with new nuclear data.

Abstract: We present a fast surrogate for the Equivalent Photon Approximation (EPA) flux in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), based on a Bayesian neural network (BNN) trained over analytical flux integrals with an iterative procedure focused on regions of high relative uncertainties to minimise the number of integrations. The surrogate propagates experimentally available uncertainties on the neutron skin thickness and surface diffuseness. Once trained, this surrogate technique brings an estimated gain of two orders of magnitude in CPU time. The implementation provides a modular framework for rapidly propagating updated nuclear priors and assessing uncertainties for photon flux in future UPC analyses.

### [10] [Unified Description of Pseudoscalar Meson Structure from Light to Heavy Quarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10775)
*B. Almeida-Zamora,L. Albino,A. Bashir,J. J. Cobos-Martínez,J. Segovia*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper reviews pseudoscalar meson structures using an algebraic light-front model, unifying descriptions of parton distribution amplitudes, wave functions, and form factors derived from Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. It analyzes light, heavy-light, and heavy-heavy mesons, showing quark mass effects on momentum distributions and spatial compactness, and compares with lattice QCD and other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework for describing pseudoscalar meson properties consistently across different quark mass regimes, addressing the role of quark mass asymmetry and heavy-quark dynamics.

Method: Algebraic light-front model using Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes to derive PDAs, LFWFs, GPDs, PDFs, EFFs, charge radii, and IPS-GPDs. Applies to light, heavy-light, and heavy-heavy pseudoscalar mesons.

Result: Demonstrates transition from asymmetric to symmetric momentum distributions with increasing quark masses. Shows spatial compactness increase with heavier quarks. Provides systematic comparisons with lattice QCD and DSE methods.

Conclusion: The algebraic model successfully unifies meson structure studies across quark masses, offering accurate predictions on momentum distributions, spatial structure, and form factors, validated against other theoretical approaches.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the structure of pseudoscalar mesons within an algebraic model formulated in the light-front framework. The approach provides a unified description of leading-twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs), light-front wave functions (LFWFs), generalized parton distributions (GPDs), parton distribution functions (PDFs), elastic electromagnetic form factors (EFFs), charge radii, and impact-parameter GPDs (IPS-GPDs), all derived consistently from the same underlying Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. Results are discussed for light ($π$, $K$), heavy-light ($D$, $D_s$, $B$, $B_s$, $B_c$), and heavy-heavy ($η_c$, $η_b$) pseudoscalar mesons, allowing for a systematic analysis of the role played by quark-mass asymmetry and heavy-quark dynamics. The study highlights how increasing quark masses drive a transition from broad, asymmetric momentum distributions to increasingly symmetric and spatially compact configurations. Comparisons with lattice QCD, Dyson-Schwinger equation studies, and contact-interaction models are presented where available. Overall, the algebraic model offers a transparent and symmetry-consistent framework to explore the three-dimensional momentum and spatial structure of pseudoscalar mesons across all quark-mass regimes.

### [11] [A multidimensional landscape of the $η$ and $η'$ mesons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10791)
*L. Albino,K. Raya,R. J. Hernández-Pinto,B. Almeida-Zamora,J. Segovia,A. Huet,A. Bashir*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses a form-invariant algebraic model to study the internal structure of η and η' mesons by constructing Bethe-Salpeter wavefunctions, deriving their generalized parton distributions (GPDs), and calculating related observables like form factors, showing consistency with existing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the internal quark structure of η/η' mesons using a unified model that provides a consistent framework for pseudoscalar mesons' properties.

Method: Employ form-invariant algebraic model for quark propagators and Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes; project wavefunctions onto flavor-basis states (s\bar{s}, l\bar{l}), compute GPDs via overlap representation, and derive physical observables.

Result: Successfully constructs multidimensional GPDs from distribution amplitudes, calculates distribution functions and electromagnetic form factors, and validates against existing results for pseudoscalar mesons.

Conclusion: The model provides a reliable and consistent description of η/η' meson structures and their physical observables, supporting its broader applicability to pseudoscalar mesons.

Abstract: We employ a recently proposed form-invariant algebraic model for the quark propagator and the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude of pseudoscalar mesons to study the internal structure of $η$ and $η'$ mesons. This model facilitates the construction of the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction, whose projection onto an appropriate flavor-basis leads to the light-front wavefunction for convenient linear combinations of the $s \bar{s}$ and $l\bar{l}\sim(u \bar{u} + d \bar{d})$ states. Using an overlap representation, we compute the valence-quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs). The construction of the model ensures that this multidimensional quantity is determined entirely by the corresponding valence-quark distribution amplitudes. Once the GPDs are constructed, we carry out a straightforward derivation of other desired physical observables such as the distribution functions and the electromagnetic form factors. We also provide explicit comparisons with available results, demonstrating that the present model offers a consistent physical picture for all ground-state pseudoscalar mesons.

### [12] [Three-loop helicity amplitudes of four-lepton scattering in QED](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10807)
*Giulio Crisanti,Thomas Dave,Pierpaolo Mastrolia,Jonathan Ronca,Sid Smith,William J. Torres Bobadilla*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates three-loop virtual corrections for helicity amplitudes in massless QED four-fermion processes, using Feynman diagrams organized by Symanzik polynomials and integration-by-parts methods. Results are expressed as generalized polylogarithms and applied to specific scattering processes like dimuon production and Bhabha scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately calculate higher-order QED corrections for precise predictions in four-fermion scattering processes, crucial for high-energy experiments like electron-positron colliders.

Method: Grouped Feynman diagrams into integrand families via Symanzik polynomials, reduced to master integrals with optimized integration-by-parts, performed UV renormalization and infrared pole extraction, resulting in finite expressions through generalized polylogarithms.

Result: Three-loop virtual corrections derived for specific processes (dimuon production, Bhabha scattering), with finite terms expressed up to weight six transcendental functions, enabling higher precision in theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The derived amplitudes provide essential inputs for next-generation precision calculations in particle physics, especially relevant for future collider experiments requiring QED corrections at three-loop level.

Abstract: We present the analytic expressions of the three-loop virtual corrections to the helicity amplitudes of 2 -> 2 four-fermion scattering processes in massless QED. The contributing Feynman diagrams are grouped into integrand families characterised by independent Symanzik polynomials and decomposed in terms of master integrals using an optimised integration-by-parts strategy. Upon the renormalisation of the ultraviolet divergences and the extraction of the universal infrared pole structure, the finite results are expressed in terms of generalised polylogarithms up to transcendental weight six. Amplitudes for dimuon production in electron-positron annihilations, electron-muon scattering, and Bhabha scattering are explicitly derived.

### [13] [The formation of inhomogeneities in gravitational string like mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10834)
*G. A. Kozlov*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how scalar fields in an extended Abelian-Higgs model with hidden dark sectors can form topological defects (strings) that explain cosmological compact objects through magnetic flux quanta stabilized by dark vector fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand inhomogeneities in inflationary cosmology, particularly the role of scalar fields in forming structure via topological defects.

Method: Proposes a scale-invariant Standard Model extension using complex scalar and vector fields in a dark sector minimally coupled to gravity; analyzes conditions for magnetic flux stabilization in string-like structures.

Result: Shows that strings can form energetically favorable configurations hosting magnetic flux quanta whose size relates to dark vector field mass, providing a mechanism for compact object formation.

Conclusion: Topological defects in this model offer a viable pathway for generating cosmological structures like compact objects through magnetic flux quantization in dark sector fields.

Abstract: The investigation of the inhomogeneities in modern inflationary Universe scenarios is related, in particular, with the study of the role played by scalar fields in cosmological evolution. We present the model described by one of the extensions of the Abelian-Higgs theory, where the scale-invariant approach to the Standard Model (SM) is achieved by introducing the complex scalar fields and the vector fields in the hidden (dark) sector, where the latter and the SM are minimally coupled to gravity. The formation of the cosmological compact objects intuitively is explained in terms of the topological line defects - the string like tubes. The strings can get an energetically preferable configuration corresponding to the magnetic flux quantum inside an area defined by the mass of dark vector field.

### [14] [Light to Heavy, Brief to Eternal: An Axion for Every Occasion (in the Early Universe)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11121)
*Francesco D'Eramo*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how the early universe can be leveraged to probe axion properties across four distinct lifetime scenarios, demonstrating the potential of cosmological data to study axions across a wide mass and lifetime spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The early universe's high energy scales allow unstable Standard Model particles to interact dynamically, providing a unique environment to study axions which are beyond terrestrial experiment capabilities. The motivation is to quantify the early universe's potential in probing axion properties and interactions.

Method: The study categorizes axion scenarios into four classes based on axion lifetimes: dark radiation contributors, dark matter candidates, metastable axions affecting 21 cm signals, and short-lived portal axions. Each scenario is analyzed for their cosmological impacts and observable signatures.

Result: The analysis shows that these axion scenarios interconnect axion phenomenology with early universe cosmology. Cosmological data can probe axions over broad mass and lifetime ranges through effects like dark radiation, dark matter density, 21 cm signals, and interactions via portals.

Conclusion: The early universe offers a powerful tool to explore axion physics beyond lab experiments. Future cosmological observations, particularly of the 21 cm signal and CMB, could significantly constrain or detect axion parameters, emphasizing the synergy between particle physics and cosmology.

Abstract: The early universe grants access to energy scales far beyond those achievable in terrestrial experiments and allows unstable Standard Model particles to play an active dynamical role. In this contribution, we focus on recent studies aimed at quantifying the potential of the early universe to probe the properties and interactions of axions. The discussion is organized around four classes of axion scenarios, ordered from long to short lifetimes: (i) stable or long-lived axions contributing to dark radiation; (ii) stable or long-lived axions produced out-of-equilibrium and constituting dark matter; (iii) metastable axions whose decays inject energy into the primordial plasma and leave observable signatures in the global 21 cm signal; and (iv) very short-lived axions that act only as portals to additional degrees of freedom. Together, these scenarios highlight the interplay between axion phenomenology and early universe cosmology and demonstrate the potential of cosmological data to probe axions over a broad range of masses and lifetimes.

TL;DR: The paper presents the first definitively detected optical TDE occurring far from its host galaxy's nucleus, likely involving a wandering black hole, discovered through an off-nucleus ML classification method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify TDEs outside galactic nuclei, which are underrepresented in traditional surveys, and understand the prevalence and origins of such events involving wandering black holes from galaxy mergers.

Method: Used off-nucleus variant of the TDE classifier 'tdescore' on ZTF transient data, followed by multiwavelength follow-up to confirm TDE nature and measure offsets/black hole masses.

Result: Discovered TDE 2025abcr 10.3 kpc from the galaxy center, powered by a 10^6 solar mass BH possibly ejected via merger dynamics or residing in a tidally stripped dwarf galaxy. Estimated offset TDE rate ≤10% of nuclear TDEs but Rubin Observatory will detect many more annually.

Conclusion: Demonstrates existence of 'orphan' TDEs caused by wandering black holes, validates new discovery methodology, and highlights upcoming survey potential to constrain BH dynamics and galaxy merger histories.

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have traditionally been discovered in optical sky surveys through targeted searches of nuclear transients. However, it is expected that some TDEs will occur outside the galaxy nucleus, arising from wandering black holes originating in galaxy mergers. Here we present observations of TDE 2025abcr, the first optical TDE discovered in the outskirts of a host galaxy. The TDE was identified by a custom 'off-nuclear' implementation of the ML classifier $\texttt{tdescore}$, which classifies new ZTF transients based on their lightcurves. Follow-up observations confirm that TDE 2025abcr is a TDE-H+He, occurring 9.5$"$ (10.3 kpc projected distance) from the nucleus of a massive galaxy ($\mathrm{M}_{\star}$ = $10^{11.18 \pm 0.03}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) with a central black hole mass of $10^{8.82 \pm 0.65}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. TDE 2025abcr itself was likely disrupted by a much lighter black hole ($10^{6.09\pm0.53}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, as estimated with peak luminosity scaling relations). The black hole was either dynamically ejected from the nucleus or lies at the center of a very faint tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy undergoing a minor merger. Late-time observations of TDE 2025abcr could confirm the origin of this apparent 'orphan' black hole. The rate of highly offset ($\gtrsim$3 kpc) TDEs can be constrained to $<$10% of the nuclear TDE rate, but our discovery implies that many dozens of similar sources will be detected by the Vera C. Rubin each year with resolvable offsets.

### [16] [Machine Learning Methods for Stellar Collisions. I. Predicting Outcomes of SPH Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10191)
*Elena González Prieto,James C. Lombardi,,Sanaea C. Rose,Charles F. A. Gibson,Christopher E. O'Connor,Tjitske Starkenburg,Fulya Kıroğlu,Kyle Kremer,Tristan C. Parmerlee,Frederic A. Rasio*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents collAIder, a machine learning framework using a large SPH simulation grid to predict stellar collision outcomes efficiently, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stellar collisions are critical in dense clusters but computationally expensive to simulate. Existing analytic models lack generalizability, necessitating a faster, accurate method.

Method: Trained ML models (nearest neighbors, SVMs, neural networks) on 27,720 SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions to predict collision outcomes and remnant masses.

Result: Achieved 98.4% balanced accuracy for classification and relative errors of 0.11-0.15% for mass predictions. The models are publicly available in collAIder.

Conclusion: collAIder enables rapid, accurate integration of stellar collision physics in N-body simulations, advancing studies of cluster dynamics and black hole formation.

Abstract: Stellar collisions can occur frequently in dense cluster environments, and play a crucial role in producing exotic phenomena from blue stragglers in globular clusters to high-energy transients in galactic nuclei. Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\%$ and $0.15\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively. We make our trained models publicly available as part of the package collAIder, enabling rapid predictions of stellar collision outcomes in $N$-body models of dense star cluster dynamics.

### [17] [New Deep Radio Continuum Imaging Still Indicates a Large Reservoir of Undiscovered Millisecond Pulsars in Terzan 5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10199)
*Ryan Urquhart,Jay Strader,Laura Chomiuk,Scott M. Ransom,Craig O. Heinke,Arash Bahramian,Thomas J. Maccarone*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents deep, high-resolution radio images of the globular cluster Terzan 5, detecting 38 of 49 known pulsars and estimating a total population of ~250 detectable pulsars, emphasizing its importance for future radio observatories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the pulsar population and understand the radio continuum emission in the highly crowded Terzan 5 cluster, surpassing previous detection limits and informing future observational strategies.

Method: Using 2-4 GHz Karl G. Jansky VLA imaging, multi-frequency eclipse mapping of Ter5A, and modeling residual flux with image-based simulations to estimate total pulsar population.

Result: Detected 38 pulsars, identified diffuse residual flux from fainter sources, estimated ~250 detectable pulsars, and found consistency with gamma-ray observations despite uncertainties in luminosity functions.

Conclusion: Terzan 5 holds a significant pulsar population, exceeding prior estimates, and is critical for next-gen radio facilities to further study cluster dynamics and pulsar populations.

Abstract: We present the deepest and highest-resolution radio continuum imaging of the Galactic globular cluster Terzan 5, one of the most crowded locations in the radio sky. In these new 2$-$4 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array images, we detect 38 of the 49 confirmed pulsars, including extensive multi-frequency eclipse mapping of the luminous redback Ter5A. Nonetheless, there is still a large amount of diffuse residual flux from pulsars that are fainter than our 2.5 GHz continuum detection limit of $\sim 11\,μ$Jy. Using a range of approaches including image-based simulations, we model the fluxes of the detected pulsars together with the residual flux. We find a minimum total population of $N\sim250$ detectable pulsars in Terzan 5 and perhaps substantially more, though the luminosity function remains very uncertain. Consideration of the $γ$-ray properties of the cluster, though also not unambiguous to interpret, leads to consistent conclusions. These pulsar population estimates are larger than inferred from previous work and highlight Terzan 5 as a keystone target for next-generation radio facilities.

### [18] [Evidence for neutrino emission from X-ray Bright Seyfert Galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere using Enhanced Starting Track Events with IceCube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10208)
*The IceCube Collaboration*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents evidence that Seyfert galaxies contribute to extragalactic high-energy neutrinos, detecting a 6.7±3.7 event excess from 14 Southern Sky Seyferts at 3σ significance using IceCube data 2011–2021, leveraging their correlation with X-ray emission via disk-corona models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Seyfert galaxies are sources of high-energy neutrinos, given IceCube's detection of TeV neutrinos from NGC 1068 and discrepancies between neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes suggesting production in high-radiation regions near supermassive black holes.

Method: Analyzed IceCube's Southern Sky muon neutrino data (2011–2021), selected 14 Seyferts from Swift/BAT survey, searched for individual/collective signals using X-ray-TeV neutrino correlations from disk-corona models, assuming NGC 1068-like production mechanisms.

Result: Observed a 6.7_{-3.2}^{+4.0} neutrino event excess inconsistent with background at 3σ level, providing independent evidence for Seyfert contributions to cosmic neutrino flux.

Conclusion: Seyfert galaxies likely contribute to extragalactic high-energy neutrino flux, supporting the hypothesis that their active nuclei produce neutrinos obscured gamma-rays through interactions in high-radiation disk-corona environments.

Abstract: IceCube recently reported the observation of TeV neutrinos from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC~1068, and the corresponding neutrino flux is significantly higher than the upper limit implied by observations of GeV-TeV gamma rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced near the supermassive black hole, where the radiation density is high enough to obscure gamma rays. We use a set of muon neutrinos with interaction vertices inside the detector, which have good sensitivity to sources in the Southern sky, from IceCube data recorded between 2011 and 2021. We then search for individual and collective neutrino signals from 14 Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky selected from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN Spectroscopic Survey. Using the correlations between keV X-rays and TeV neutrinos predicted by disk-corona models, and assuming production characteristics similar to NGC~1068, a collective neutrino signal search reveals an excess of $6.7_{-3.2}^{+4.0}$ events, which is inconsistent with background expectations at the 3$σ$ level of significance. In this paper, we present new independent evidence that Seyfert galaxies contribute to the extragalactic flux of high-energy neutrinos.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper discusses spider binary systems, focusing on the impact of millisecond pulsars on their low-mass companions through pulsar winds. Updated models incorporating a synchrotron kernel, injection spectra, and shock geometries predict TeV signatures observable by Cherenkov telescopes, aiding in understanding particle dynamics and system properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictions of TeV emissions from spider binaries and constrain parameters like wind properties and shock geometry using updated emission models.

Method: The study enhances an emission code with updated synchrotron kernels, parametric injection spectra, and multiple shock geometries to simulate broadband photon emissions. Phase-dependent light curves and spectra are computed.

Result: Improved predictions of TeV light curves and spectra showing orbital modulation from inverse Compton scattering. These allow constraints on particle acceleration, wind dynamics, and system inclination angles.

Conclusion: Future Cherenkov telescope observations using the model's outputs can揭开 more关于蜘蛛双星的粒子动力学和结构, including对系统参数的约束.

Abstract: 'Spider' binary systems - black widow and redback compact binaries differentiated by their companion's mass and nature - are an important type of pulsar system exhibiting a rich empirical phenomenology, including radio eclipses, optical light curves from a heated companion, as well as non-thermal X-ray and GeV orbital light curves and spectra. Multi-wavelength observations have now resulted in the detection of >~50 of these systems in which a millisecond pulsar heats and ablates its low-mass companion via its intense pulsar wind. Broadband observations have established the presence of relativistic leptons that have been accelerated in the pulsar magnetosphere and near the intrabinary shock, as well as a hot companion, presenting an ideal environment for the creation of orbitally-modulated inverse Compton fluxes that should be within reach of current and future Cherenkov telescopes. We have included an updated synchrotron kernel, different parametric injection spectral shapes, and several intrabinary shock geometries in our emission code to improve our predictions of the expected TeV signatures from spider binaries. Our updated phase-dependent spectral and energy-dependent light curve outputs may aid in constraining particle energetics, wind properties, shock geometry, and system inclination of several spider binaries.

### [20] [Constraining the Evolution of the HI Spin Temperature with Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10328)
*Hugh Roxburgh,Marcin Glowacki,Apurba Bera,Clancy James*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to study atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption signals in host galaxies' interstellar medium, combining HI emission maps to probe neutral gas dynamics through HI spin temperature measurements. Using FRB 20211127I, they establish upper limits on optical depth and spin temperature, suggesting future prospects with sensitive telescopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore cosmological neutral gas dynamics and thermal processes via HI absorption signals from FRBs, which offer a unique, direct method unavailable with traditional observations.

Method: Analyzed FRB 20211127I (detected by ASKAP) and MeerKAT HI emission data to constrain HI spin temperature. Used pulse-averaged spectrum to set optical depth upper limit (33 km/s) and derived T_spin lower limit (26 K). Evaluated requirements for future FRB observations to improve constraints.

Result: Found preliminary constraints on optical depth and spin temperature, showing current limitations but identifying future potential with high-fluence FRBs and telescopes like FAST. Demonstrated feasibility via proof-of-concept.

Conclusion: HI absorption via FRBs can constrain interstellar medium properties, aiding in understanding FRB host environments. Future sensitive observations (e.g., FAST stacking) are critical for robust measurements and addressing FRB science challenges.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) emit broad band radio wave radiation that may, in rare cases, encode atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption signals produced as they traverse the interstellar medium of their host galaxies. Combining such signals with high resolution HI emission maps offers a unique opportunity to probe the dynamics of neutral gas at cosmological distances through constraints of the HI excitation temperature $T_{spin}$, which characterises the balance of neutral gas phases and the underlying thermal processes within these galactic environments. While no absorption signal has been recorded in an FRB to date, we demonstrate a proof of concept with the bright (F = 35 Jy ms) and narrow (0.2 ms) FRB 20211127I detected by ASKAP. We find a 3$σ$ upper limit on the integrated optical depth in the pulse-averaged spectrum of 33 km s$^{-1}$, and, based on the HI emission observed in a 3 hr MeerKAT L-band observation, subsequently find a lower limit on $T_{spin}$ of 26 K. While this test case provides little constraining power, we find that narrow, non-repeating FRBs with fluences greater than 20/70/150 Jy ms observed with all dishes with the current MeerKAT/ASKAP/DSA telescopes can probe integrated optical depths below 5 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we highlight that utilising FAST's incredible sensitivity to stack thousands of bursts from hyperactive repeaters also provides a plausible avenue through which HI absorption, and hence $T_{spin}$, can be measured. Finally, we discuss how HI absorption can address several modern challenges in FRB science, providing a physical anchor for locating bursts within their host galaxies and helping to disentangle the host contribution to dispersion and scattering.

### [21] [A 682-second X-ray Periodicity in CH Cygni: Evidence for a Magnetic White Dwarf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10511)
*Manuel Pichardo Marcano,Thomas J. Maccarone,Liliana E. Rivera Sandoval*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The detection of a 682.5-second X-ray pulsation in CH Cygni reveals a magnetic white dwarf, confirming it as the second symbiotic star with such X-ray pulsations and supporting the magnetic propeller model for its jet activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbiotic stars, crucial as potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, were thought to often have magnetic white dwarfs, but direct evidence was lacking. Previous studies only identified such magnetism in R Aquarii.

Method: Analyzed XMM-Newton X-ray light curve data to detect a periodicity of 682.5 ± 7 seconds, interpreted as the white dwarf's spin period. This indicates a magnetic WD capable of generating X-ray pulsations.

Result: Discovered the second known symbiotic star with confirmed X-ray pulsations (after R Aquarii), providing direct evidence of a magnetic white dwarf in CH Cygni.

Conclusion: The findings support the magnetic propeller model for CH Cygni's jets and state changes, advancing understanding of magnetic fields in symbiotic systems and their supernova progenitor role.

Abstract: Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries consisting of a red giant and typically a white dwarf, important as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. Despite theoretical predictions that white dwarfs in symbiotic systems should often be magnetic, direct evidence has been elusive. We report the discovery of a $682.5 \pm 7$ s periodicity in the XMM-Newton X-ray light curve that we interpret as the spin period of the WD in CH Cygni. This detection provides strong evidence for a magnetic white dwarf in CH Cygni, making it only the second WD symbiotic star with confirmed X-ray pulsations after R Aquarii. Our discovery supports the magnetic propeller model previously proposed for CH Cygni's jet activity and state transitions.

### [22] [First Detection of $γ$-Ray Emission from the Compact Symmetric Object JVAS J1311+1658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10572)
*Xiong Jiang,Yang-Ji Li,Hai Lei,Da-Ming Wei*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The first detection of γ-ray emission from the young radio galaxy JVAS J1311+1658 is reported, showing a GeV γ-ray flare with significant flux and variability. The emission is linked to sub-kiloparsec-scale jets, offering insights into early jet activity in young galaxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the γ-ray emission mechanisms and early-stage jet activity in young radio galaxies, specifically targeting compact symmetric objects (CSOs) which are poorly understood in high-energy regimes.

Method: Analysis of Fermi-LAT data between MJD 60032.6–60132.6 to identify γ-ray flares, followed by radiative modeling of radio lobes and comparison with observed γ-ray flux. Spectral and temporal variability studies were also conducted.

Result: Detection of a 6.2σ significant γ-ray source with an average flux of (1.6±0.6)×10⁻⁸ ph/cm²/s and a photon index Γ=2.15. The observed flux exceeds predictions from radio lobe models, indicating jet origin. Strong flux and 100-day variability suggest emission from newly launched jets.

Conclusion: The γ-ray emission originates from young, compact jets in JVAS J1311+1658, revealing insights into early jet dynamics, relativistic particle acceleration, and the role of jets in galaxy evolution during their formation phases.

Abstract: We report the first detection of $γ$-ray emission from the young radio galaxy JVAS~J1311+1658, classified as a compact symmetric object (CSO). This detection is characterized by a recent GeV $γ$-ray flare identified in Fermi-LAT data during MJD~60032.6--60132.6, with a $γ$-ray source detected at a significance level of $\sim6.2σ$. The average 0.1--300~GeV flux is measured to be $(1.6 \pm 0.6)\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, with a photon spectral index of $Γ= 2.15 \pm 0.185$. We find that a radiative model of the radio lobes significantly underestimates the observed $γ$-ray emission. The strong flux and short-term variability over $\sim$100 days suggest that the emission likely originates from newly launched sub-kiloparsec-scale jets at the core. This detection provides a unique window into the extreme environments and early-stage jet activity of young radio galaxies, offering insights into their initial evolution and the formation of relativistic jets in the earliest phases of galaxy growth.

### [23] [Linking {\it Fermi} blazars and radio galaxies through accretion and jet radiation mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10653)
*Xu-Hong Ye,Ranieri D. Baldi,Wen-Xin Yang,Jing-Tian Zhu,Denis Bastieri,Rumen S. Bachev,Anton A. Strigachev,Jun-Hui Fan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the unified accretion and ejection scenario between blazars and radio galaxies by analyzing their optical emission-line classifications (LERGs/HERGs) and high-energy emission properties, showing that LERGs/HERGs correspond to the misaligned counterparts of BL Lacs/FSRQs through similarities in gamma-ray luminosity, photon indices, and Compton dominance patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the connection between blazars (BL Lacs/FSRQs) and radio galaxies (LERGs/HERGs) under a unified model of accretion and jet activity by linking their observational properties across different viewing angles.

Method: Compiled a sample of Fermi blazars and radio galaxies. Conducted statistical analyses of accretion properties, high-energy beaming patterns, and correlations in gamma-ray luminosity-photon index, Compton dominance-photon index, and accretion rate-photon index diagrams.

Result: HERGs align with FSRQs in higher gamma-ray luminosity/softer photon indices and EC dominance, while LERGs match BL Lacs in lower luminosity/harder indices and SSC dominance. Two distinct accretion-ejection states emerge: low-accretion (SSC; BL Lacs/LERGs) vs high-accretion (EC; FSRQs/HERGs).

Conclusion: The findings confirm a unified accretion-ejection paradigm where LERGs/HERGs are misaligned versions of BL Lacs/FSRQs, with their emission mechanisms and accretion states directly correlated, supporting a two-state model for radio-loud AGNs.

Abstract: Based on the classical unification, blazars, namely BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), are believed to correspond with radio galaxies when observed at small jet viewing angles. In this paper, we aim to compile a sample of Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to provide new insights towards a unified accretion and ejection scenario between aligned and misaligned radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), by considering their optical emission-line classifications (low- and high-excitation radio galaxies, LERGs, HERGs), which are more representative of their accretion states. We adopted statistical analyses of accretion properties and high-energy beaming patterns for both Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to investigate a unified accretion-ejection scenario. In the gamma-ray luminosity-photon index plane, HERGs populate the region of higher luminosities and softer photon indices, akin to FSRQs, whereas LERGs fill lower luminosities with harder photon indices, analogous to BL Lacs. This parallel segregation indicates that LERGs and HERGs represent the misaligned counterparts of BL Lacs and FSRQs, respectively. The unified picture is further supported by the Compton dominance-photon index diagram, where FSRQs and HERGs dominated by external Compton (EC) emissions are distinctly separated from BL Lacs and LERGs governed by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emissions. Similarly, the diagram of accretion rate versus gamma-ray photon index reveals two distinct accretion-ejection states: a low-accretion-rate branch (BL Lacs and LERGs) is associated with the SSC model, and a high-accretion-rate branch (FSRQs and HERGs) is linked to the EC model. These results strongly strengthen the idea of a unified accretion and ejection paradigm between blazars and radio galaxies into two distinct states.

### [24] [Distance Estimation and Sky Localization of Eccentric Double White Dwarf Binaries from Gravitational Wave Observations inside Globular Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10664)
*Yuetong Zhao,L. Hellström,Siqi Zhang,M. Giersz,A. Askar,Youjun Lu,Zhoujian Cao,D. Belloni,G. Wiktorowicz,M. Górski*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that analyzing gravitational wave signals from eccentric double white dwarf binaries in globular clusters can provide precise distance and sky location estimates, surpassing current methods, even for low eccentricity binaries, with higher precision achievable at higher eccentricities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating cosmic distances using circular DWD binaries have limitations in signal strength and distinguishing environments (field vs. dense clusters). Eccentric binaries, though less common, offer stronger signals and could enable independent, precise distance measurements for objects in dense environments like globular clusters.

Method: Used MOCCA GC simulations to model eccentric DWD binaries in Milky Way GCs, simulated GW signals detectable by LISA, and analyzed the precision of distance/sky location estimation through signal analysis.

Result: Eccentric binaries (even with low eccentricity) yield distance estimates with higher precision than existing techniques. Higher eccentricity improves precision further. A few such binaries are expected in Milky Way dense environments, enabling precise, independent measurements.

Conclusion: GW analysis of eccentric DWDs in dense environments provides a novel, high-precision cosmic distance measurement method complementary to traditional techniques, useful for studying objects in globular clusters and Magellanic Clouds.

Abstract: The cosmic distance scale is built on multiple different techniques for estimating distances in space that are often connected and dependent on multiple measurements and assumptions. Double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) are common objects and are expected to produce gravitational wave (GW) signals that can be observed with space-based detectors such as LISA. By analyzing these signals we should be able to estimate the distance and sky location of the source. Previous studies have done this for circular binaries which, while they are abundant, have, in general, weaker signals than eccentric binaries and it is not possible to differentiate whether a circular binary is in the field or in a dense environment such as a globular cluster (GC). In this paper we used eccentric binaries from MOCCA GC simulations, simulated the GW signal from each binary at locations related to GCs in the Milky Way and estimated the precision on the distance and the sky location of the source. We find that distances can be estimated with higher precision than current day methods even with low eccentricity binaries and higher eccentricity further increases this precision. Although the probability of finding a tight and eccentric DWD is far lower than a circular one, we can expect to find at least a few in the dense environments of the Milky Way, such as GCs. These estimations would be independent measurements with high precision to objects inside dense environments, such as GCs inside the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds.

TL;DR: This paper discusses how new telescopes and advanced simulations will advance our understanding of black hole jets, addressing their formation, dynamics, and energy processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unresolved questions about jet launching, collimation, and energy dissipation by leveraging upcoming observational facilities and theoretical models.

Method: The authors review upcoming observatories (EHT, CTA, LSST, WEBT) and theoretical frameworks (MADs, GRMHD simulations) to outline future research directions.

Result: Expected outcomes include improved constraints on jet dynamics, variability, and multi-wavelength signatures through combined observational and simulation approaches.

Conclusion: Future synergies between high-resolution observations and theoretical models will transform our comprehension of black hole jet physics in the next decade.

Abstract: Black hole jets represent one of the most extreme manifestations of astrophysical processes, linking accretion physics, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, and large-scale feedback in galaxies and clusters. Despite decades of observational and theoretical work, the mechanisms governing jet launching, collimation, and energy dissipation remain open questions. In this article, we discuss how upcoming facilities such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST), and the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) will provide unprecedented constraints on jet dynamics, variability, and multi-wavelength signatures. Furthermore, we highlight theoretical challenges, including the role of magnetically arrested disks (MADs), plasma microphysics, and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations in shaping our understanding of jet formation. By combining high-resolution imaging, time-domain surveys, and advanced simulations, the next decade promises transformative progress in unveiling the physics of black hole jets.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The discovery of a second associated magnetar X-ray burst (MXB 221014) and fast radio burst (FRB 221014) from SGR J1935+2154 confirms their physical connection, showing both similarities and differences compared to the earlier event MXB/FRB 200428, which advances understanding of their mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the association between MXB and FRB detected in 2020 was genuine or coincidental by analyzing a new event.

Method: Temporal and spectral analysis of MXB 221014 using GECAM data, comparing it with MXB 200428, and correlating with observed FRB data from CHIME/GBT.

Result: Found a temporally aligned X-ray pulse with the FRB main pulse, similar to 2020 event, but with distinct differences, confirming association while showing diverse burst morphologies.

Conclusion: The confirmed MXB-FRB association suggests magnetars can produce both, but mechanisms may vary; further studies are needed to understand these connections and diversity.

Abstract: Fast radio burst (FRB) is mysterious phenomenon with millisecond-duration radio pulses observed mostly from cosmological distance. The association between FRB 200428 and a magnetar X-ray burst (MXB) from SGR J1935+2154 has significantly advanced the understanding of FRB and magnetar bursts. However, it is uncertain whether this association between MXB and FRB (i.e. MXB/FRB 200428) is genuine or just coincidental only based on this single event. Here we report the discovery of a bright ($\rm\sim7.6\times10^{-7}\,erg \cdot cm^{-2}$ in 1-250 keV) magnetar X-ray burst detected by GECAM on October 14th, 2022 (dubbed as MXB 221014) from SGR J1935+2154, which is associated with a FRB detected by CHIME and GBT. We conducted a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of MXB 221014 with GECAM data and find that it is a bright and typical ($T_{90}\sim$250 ms) X-ray burst from this magnetar. Interestingly, we find two narrow X-ray pulses in the MXB, one of which temporally aligns with the main pulse of the FRB 221014 $\sim5.70$ ms latter than the peak time of FRB 221014), resembling the feature found in MXB/FRB 200428. Furthermore, we did comprehensive comparison between MXB/FRB 221014 and MXB/FRB 200428, and find that while the two events share several common features, they also exhibit distinct differences, highlighting the variety of the MXB-FRB association morphology. This finding not only confirms the association between MXB and FRB but also provides new insights into the mechanism of and the relationship between FRB and MXB.

### [27] [An Enhanced Formation Channel for Galactic Dual-Line Gravitational-Wave Sources: von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effect in Triples Involving Sgr A*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10928)
*Wen-Fan Feng,Tan Liu,Yun Fang,Yacheng Kang,Bin Liu,Lijing Shao*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis reveals that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect in hierarchical triples with the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A* can significantly boost the formation rate of Galactic Center binary systems acting as dual-line gravitational wave sources, increasing their detectability by future observatories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to explain the formation channels of compact binary systems in the Galactic Center that emit detectable gravitational waves in both millihertz (via space-borne detectors) and hectohertz bands (via ground-based detectors).

Method: Proposing the ZLK effect in hierarchical triples involving Sgr A* as a mechanism to modulate binary eccentricity and inclination, thereby enhancing GW emission and formation rates of dual-line sources.

Result: The ZLK effect increases dual-line GW source counts by ~3x to ~O(1) in 4 years, making detections more likely.

Conclusion: The ZLK-induced dynamics provide a crucial formation pathway for these systems, highlighting its significance for multi-band gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: The dense Galactic Center environment is expected to host compact binary inspirals detectable by future space-borne gravitational wave (GW) observatories (e.g., LISA, TianQin, Taiji) in the millihertz band. Aided by information from these facilities, next-generation ground-based GW detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) can potentially capture gravitational radiation in the hectohertz band from rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) components in such binaries. These Galactic Center systems are thus anticipated to act as dual-line (i.e., low-frequency inspiral and high-frequency spin) GW sources. However, the formation channels of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this \textit{Letter}, we propose that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect can enhance the formation of dual-line GW sources in hierarchical triples involving the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. We show that ZLK-driven oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary can modulate the GW emission from both the binary inspiral and the individual NS spins. This effect boosts the expected dual-line source count by a factor of $\sim 3$, from rare to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in 4 years, making dual-line observations substantially more probable. Our results demonstrate that the ZLK effect provides an important formation channel for Galactic dual-line GW sources.

### [28] [X-ray stellar feedback in low-metallicity starbursts: Insights from the template starburst galaxy ESO 338-IG04 and its halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10979)
*M. Chatzis,L. M. Oskinova,S. Reyero Serantes,B. D. Lehmer,G. Östlin,A. Bik,M. Hayes,J. M. Mas-Hesse,J. S. Gallagher,F. Fürst*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of the blue compact dwarf galaxy ESO 338-IG04 reveals that its X-ray emission, including ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and diffuse gas, significantly contributes to ionizing the interstellar medium, particularly enhancing He II emission due to low metallicity and high star formation activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how X-ray binaries influence stellar feedback in low-metallicity starburst galaxies, using ESO 338-4 as a case study to understand their role in ionization and chemical enrichment.

Method: Analyzed Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray data, including spectra, light curves, and images, identified ULXs and diffuse gas. Used photoionization models to link X-ray sources to observed He II emission.

Result: Detected five ULXs and diffuse gas with total X-ray luminosity exceeding 10^41 erg/s. ULX1 exhibits rapid variability and no stellar cluster association. Models show X-ray sources can power He II λ4686 emission (~10^39 erg/s).

Conclusion: X-ray binaries are critical for ionizing He II in low-metallicity environments, highlighting their importance in feedback mechanisms and nebular emission in such systems.

Abstract: The X-ray output of low-metallicity starburst galaxies is a key component of stellar feedback, tracing the processes responsible for gas ionization and chemical enrichment. The integrated X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) from high-mass X-ray binaries in star-forming galaxies scales with both the star formation rate (SFR) and host-galaxy metallicity $Z$. Due to the inverse correlation between $L_X/\mathrm{SFR}$ and $Z$, the contribution of X-ray binaries to the ionizing photon budget is enhanced in metal-poor systems and may ionize He II in the surrounding interstellar medium, powering nebular He II $\lambda4686$ emission. The blue compact dwarf galaxy ESO 338-IG04 (ESO 338-4) provides a nearby laboratory for studying stellar feedback in a low-metallicity starburst, combining vigorous recent star formation, low metallicity ($12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})\approx7.9$), and a rich population of massive stellar clusters. We characterize the X-ray emission of ESO 338-4 and its halo using new deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We analyze X-ray spectra, light curves, and images to constrain the nature of its X-ray sources. We identify five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and diffuse hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Two ULXs are spatially associated with stellar clusters. The total X-ray luminosity exceeds $10^{41}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. The brightest source, ULX1, shows variability on day timescales and lacks a stellar-cluster counterpart. Photoionization modeling shows that X-ray sources significantly impact the ionizing photon budget; models with ULX1 as the ionizing source predict nebular He II $\lambda4686$ luminosities of $\sim10^{39}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$.

### [29] [Population Properties of Binary Black Holes with Eccentricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11030)
*Muhammad Zeeshan,Richard O'Shaughnessy,Natalie Malagon*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents the first population inference analysis that jointly models mass, spin, redshift, and eccentricity distributions of gravitational-wave events. It finds population properties consistent with previous quasi-circular studies but notes weak observational constraints and model dependence on eccentric event rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the historical limitations of quasi-circular binary analyses by incorporating eccentricity into population studies, leveraging improved detector sensitivity and waveform models.

Method: Uses the RIFT framework with SEOBNRv5EHM waveforms and an extended O4a population model including eccentricity. Performs parameter estimation and compares four parametric eccentricity distribution models.

Result: Populations broadly match prior quasi-circular findings. Eccentric event branching ratio <0.0239 (90% confidence). Observational data weakly constrain eccentricity rates, showing strong model dependency.

Conclusion: Current data insufficient to strongly favor eccentric formation channels. Future detector upgrades and more eccentric events needed to better constrain population models.

Abstract: The improved sensitivity of Gravitational-Wave detectors and the development of eccentric waveform models enable us to explore the growing catalog of gravitational-wave events with measurable eccentricity. This opens new opportunities to gain insight into the formation channels and evolutionary pathways of compact binary systems using eccentricity. However, most recent population analyses have been limited to quasi-circular binaries, primarily due to constraints in waveform modeling and sensitivity estimates. We are now entering an era where both of these limitations are being addressed, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of eccentric binary populations. In this work, we perform the first population inference analysis that simultaneously fits the mass, spin, redshift, and eccentricity distribution. Specifically, we use source-parameter estimation provided by the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) framework using the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, and a default O4a population model extended to include eccentricity. We find population properties broadly consistent with conclusions obtained in previous analyses assuming quasi-circular binaries. Consistent with our conclusions about each event, we bound the branching ratio for eccentric events to be below $0.0239$ at $90\%$ confidence with our fiducial eccentricity mixture models. Using four different parametric population models for eccentricity, we point out that the rate of eccentric events is weakly constrained by observations and highly model-dependent.

*Josep Martí,Pedro L. Luque-Escamilla,Josep M. Paredes,José Martínez Aroza*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the enigmatic ultra-high energy gamma-ray source LHAASO J2108+5157 through near-infrared observations. No definitive counterparts or emission signatures were found, leaving its origin uncertain and necessitating further deep observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the nature of LHAASO J2108+5157, which lacks confirmed counterparts and has inconclusive associations with proposed Galactic scenarios or microquasar candidates.

Method: The team conducted deep near-infrared JHKs imaging and narrow-band H2 v=1-0 S(1) line observations, though coverage was limited to part of the updated source region.

Result: No shocked emission, nebular structures, or accreting compact object signatures were detected. The GMRT radio source's near-infrared properties contradict both microquasar and radio galaxy associations.

Conclusion: The source remains unidentified within positional uncertainties. Deeper observations are required to resolve its puzzling nature.

Abstract: LHAASO J2108+5157 is one of the few ultra-high energy gamma-ray sources in the LHAASO catalogue without secure counterpart at longer wavelengths. Several Galactic scenarios have been proposed, including an evolved supernova remnant and a pulsar wind nebula. Yet, no shocked gas, shell-like structure, or compact pulsar candidate has been identified. Follow-up observations with VERITAS and the LST-1 prototype have not firmly clarified its nature. A recent microquasar candidate from GMRT radio data remains uncertain. Here we present the first dedicated near-infrared study of the field, combining deep JHKs imaging with narrow band observations targeting the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line. Our observations were initially planned to encompass the full source region, but now only partially cover the latest updated position and size of LHAASO J2108+5157. We find no evidence of shocked emission, extended nebular structures, or an accreting compact object signature in the covered field. The GMRT radio source, despite its jet-like morphology, exhibits near-infrared properties incompatible with both a Galactic microquasar and a nearby radio galaxy, discouraging an association with the gamma-ray emission. Our analysis reveals no convincing counterpart consistent within the positional uncertainty, leaving LHAASO J2108+5157 as an enigmatic ultra-high energy emitter that requires deeper observations.

Motivation: To advance understanding of solar vortex dynamics and their connections to magnetic restructuring, energy transport, and explosive events while maintaining UK leadership through innovative instrumentation.

Method: Develop next-generation space-qualified instrumentation (four tunable Fabry-Pérot Interferometers) for high-resolution spectropolarimetry across solar atmospheric layers, validated via staged missions starting with balloon demos.

Conclusion: Continued investment in this instrumentation is essential to sustain UK leadership and meet solar research objectives outlined in the 2035 roadmap, critical for unraveling sun-Earth connections.

Abstract: Solar vortices are fundamental components of solar atmospheric dynamics, serving as natural laboratories for magnetic field twisting, energy concentration and transport, wave guidance, and plasma coupling across atmospheric layers. Numerical and observational studies show that solar vortices are intimately connected to key physical processes including magnetic reconnection, atmospheric heating, turbulence, and wave generation. This white paper, prepared for the UK Space Frontiers 2035 call, outline five high-priority scientific questions addressing vortex generation mechanisms, cross-layer coupling, magnetic restructuring, collective wave-guidance structures, and their role in triggering explosive events and modulating the solar wind. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK solar physics community has established world-leading expertise in vortex dynamics, combining strengths in high-resolution observations, MHD turbulence theory, numerical modelling, and space instrumentation. UK researchers have made foundational contributions to Solar Orbiter, delivered critical systems for DKIST, and maintain active involvement in MUSE and SOLAR-C EUVST missions. Our technical approach centres on developing next-generation instrumentation: a multi-band, space-qualified system employing four tunable Fabry-Pérot Interferometers providing diffraction-limited, high-cadence spectropolarimetric coverage from the deep photosphere to the low corona. This capability will be validated through a staged mission architecture beginning with balloon-borne demonstrators. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field and achieve the goals of roadmap for solar system research.

### [33] [Cosmo3DFlow: Wavelet Flow Matching for Spatial-to-Spectral Compression in Reconstructing the Early Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10172)
*Md. Khairul Islam,Zeyu Xia,Ryan Goudjil,Jialu Wang,Arya Farahi,Judy Fox*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cosmo3DFlow, a generative framework that uses 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and flow matching to efficiently reconstruct early Universe initial conditions from evolved data, addressing computational challenges and achieving 50× faster sampling than diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing the early Universe is computationally intensive due to high dimensionality and data sparsity. Existing methods struggle with the 'void problem' and require excessive computation time.

Method: Cosmo3DFlow integrates 3D DWT to handle spatial voids by converting them into spectral sparsity, decoupling high and low-frequency components. This allows stable ODE solvers with larger steps. Flow matching is used in wavelet-transformed space to model velocity fields efficiently.

Result: At 128³ resolution, Cosmo3DFlow achieves 50× faster sampling than diffusion models, with 10× fewer integration steps and lower computational costs due to wavelet compression. Initial conditions can now be sampled in seconds instead of minutes.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective handling of cosmological inference bottlenecks, offering scalable and efficient solutions for reconstructing early Universe structures from modern simulations.

Abstract: Reconstructing the early Universe from the evolved present-day Universe is a challenging and computationally demanding problem in modern astrophysics. We devise a novel generative framework, Cosmo3DFlow, designed to address dimensionality and sparsity, the critical bottlenecks inherent in current state-of-the-art methods for cosmological inference. By integrating 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with flow matching, we effectively represent high-dimensional cosmological structures. The Wavelet Transform addresses the ``void problem'' by translating spatial emptiness into spectral sparsity. It decouples high-frequency details from low-frequency structures through spatial compression, and wavelet-space velocity fields facilitate stable ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers with large step sizes. Using large-scale cosmological $N$-body simulations, at $128^3$ resolution, we achieve up to $50\times$ faster sampling than diffusion models, combining a $10\times$ reduction in integration steps with lower per-step computational cost from wavelet compression. Our results enable initial conditions to be sampled in seconds, compared to minutes for previous methods.

### [34] [Why do we do astrophysics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10181)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper explores the implications of large language models (LLMs) in astrophysics, proposes foundational principles for the field, evaluates the benefits of astrophysics, and critiques extreme policy approaches (let-them-cook and ban-and-punish), advocating for balanced moderation instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by LLMs in astrophysics by establishing shared principles, assessing the field's contributions, and guiding responsible policy development.

Method: The author outlines points of agreement (novelty, people-centrism, trust, lack of clinical value) and enumerates benefits across societal and scientific domains. Extreme policies are analyzed and rejected in favor of moderate approaches.

Result: Identifies critical principles for astrophysics, highlights its multifaceted benefits, and demonstrates the flaws in extreme LLM policies, necessitating nuanced governance strategies.

Conclusion: Calls for developing careful, moderate policies to integrate LLMs responsibly in astrophysics, avoiding both unchecked automation and prohibitive restrictions.

Abstract: At time of writing, large language models (LLMs) are beginning to obtain the ability to design, execute, write up, and referee scientific projects on the data-science side of astrophysics. What implications does this have for our profession? In this white paper, I list - and argue for - a set of facts or "points of agreement" about what astrophysics is, or should be; these include considerations of novelty, people-centrism, trust, and (the lack of) clinical value. I then list and discuss every possible benefit that astrophysics can be seen as bringing to us, and to science, and to universities, and to the world; these include considerations of love, weaponry, and personal (and personnel) development. I conclude with a discussion of two possible (extreme and bad) policy recommendations related to the use of LLMs in astrophysics, dubbed "let-them-cook" and "ban-and-punish." I argue strongly against both of these; it is not going to be easy to develop or adopt good moderate policies.

*Ashod Khederlarian,Brett H. Andrews,Jeffrey A. Newman,Tianqing Zhang,Biprateep Dey*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study evaluates deep learning algorithms for photometric redshifts using Hubble Space Telescope data. The semi-supervised model PITA outperforms others by incorporating unlabeled data and a triple-loss function, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the effectiveness of different deep learning approaches (fully-supervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised) for high-redshift galaxy photometric redshifts using space-based imaging, as their performance was previously untested.

Method: Used Hubble's CANDELS data to compare template-based methods, classical ML, and deep learning models. Introduced PITA, a semi-supervised model using a triple-loss function combining images, colors, and available redshifts.

Result: PITA demonstrated superior performance, even with reduced training data. Self-supervised methods struggled due to noisy latent spaces. Semi-supervised learning is recommended for future Roman Space Telescope data.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised deep learning (especially PITA) optimally leverages both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling accurate photo-$z$ estimates crucial for Roman's galaxy studies and transient detection.

Abstract: Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) will be crucial for studies of galaxy evolution, large-scale structure, and transients with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Deep learning methods leverage pixel-level information from ground-based images to achieve the best photo-$z$'s for low-redshift galaxies, but their efficacy at higher redshifts with deep, space-based imaging remains largely untested. We used Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS optical and near-infrared imaging to evaluate fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised deep learning photo-$z$ algorithms out to $z\sim3$. Compared to template-based and classical machine learning photometry methods, the fully-supervised and semi-supervised models achieved better performance. Our new semi-supervised model, PITA (Photo-$z$ Inference with a Triple-loss Algorithm), outperformed all others by learning from unlabeled and labeled data through a three-part loss function that incorporates images and colors for all objects as well as redshifts when available. PITA produces a latent space that varies smoothly in magnitude, color, and redshift, resulting in the best photo-$z$ performance even when the redshift training set was significantly reduced. In contrast, the self-supervised approach produced a latent space with significant color and redshift fluctuations that hindered photo-$z$ inference. Looking forward to Roman, we recommend using semi supervised deep learning to take full advantage of the information contained in the hundreds of millions of high-resolution images and color measurements, together with the limited redshift measurements available, to achieve the most accurate photo-$z$ estimates for both faint and bright sources.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The abstract describes the development of a test bench for validating the performance of UV spectropolarimeters, particularly addressing challenges in the far-UV (FUV) channel, and aims to increase their Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the Pollux instrument proposed for HWO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the performance of Pollux's spectropolarimeters, especially in the FUV range where traditional birefringent materials cannot be used, necessitating an innovative mirror-based polarimeter. The test bench is required to confirm the precision of 1e-3 and advance TRL.

Method: The test bench operates in a vacuum chamber within a clean room, accommodating adaptable architecture for different UV wavelengths (NUV, MUV, FUV). Measurement methodologies are developed to assess polarimeter performance against the required precision.

Result: The test bench will successfully increase the TRL of UV spectropolarimeters and enable the first-ever testing of FUV spectropolarimetry, ensuring Pollux meets its performance goals.

Conclusion: This work marks a first in FUV spectropolarimetry testing and establishes a critical validation step for high-precision UV instrumentation, crucial for the success of the Pollux project on HWO.

Abstract: Pollux is a high-resolution spectropolarimeter proposed by an European consortium for HWO. The current design of Pollux features four spectropolarimetric channels, three of which are in the UV range. For the near-UV (NUV) [236-472 nm] and mid-UV (MUV) [118-236 nm] channels, the polarimeters consist of waveplates and prisms made of MgF2, a birefringent material. However, no such birefringent material can be used for the far-UV (FUV) channel [100-123 nm]. Therefore, the polarimeter for this FUV channel is composed solely of mirrors in an innovative assembly. In this talk, we aim to detail the architecture of the test bench that will allow us to validate the performance of these different polarimeters, as part of the HWO GOMaP. Given that we are working in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range, the test bench operates in a vacuum chamber in a clean room. We will discuss the adaptable architecture of the bench based on wavelength and the measurement methodology that we will implement to test if the polarimeters achieve the precision of $10^{-3}$ required for the Pollux instrument. With this test bench, we will successfully increase the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of UV spectropolarimeters and, for the first time, develop a means to test FUV spectropolarimetry.

Result: The analysis from EAC 1-3 establishes foundational architectures, identifies key engineering challenges, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the modeling pipeline in guiding decisions for subsequent EACs (4 and 5) leading up to the Mission Concept Review.

Conclusion: The findings validate the approach for HWO's pre-formulation phase, showing that iterative EACs and systematic modeling are critical to refining mission design and ensuring it meets stringent science and engineering requirements before progressing to later mission stages.

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), NASA's next flagship science mission, follows in the tradition of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and other preceding great observatories. HWO will directly image and characterize Earth-like exoplanet and their atmospheres, with the capability to detect biosignatures and potentially answer the question of whether we are we alone. HWO will also serve as a powerful general astrophysics observatory, enabling breakthroughs in galaxy evolution, stellar astrophysics, and dark matter studies. Currently in pre-formulation, the project has established Exploratory Analytic Cases (EACs), a series of architectural concept designs used to assess the mission's demanding science objectives while exploring challenging engineering parameters. This paper describes the first three EACs, starting with observing strategies and error budget formulation and then progressing to design formulations, trade studies and lessons learned; this paper also discusses the integrated modeling pipeline, a key multidisciplinary system-level analysis capability, and analysis findings as applied to the first EAC. These activities set the stage for the follow on EACs 4 and 5, which will further explore the trade space and prepare for the baseline design that will support the Mission Concept Review (MCR).

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a one-parameter family of critical spacetime crystals in arbitrary dimensions D>3, extending Choptuik's D=4 solution. It provides numerical data on echoing periods and Choptuik exponents as functions of D, showing a maximum echoing period near D=3.76, and analytical expansions suggesting these values vanish as D approaches 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize Choptuik's critical phenomena in higher dimensions, understand dimension-dependent behaviors of gravitational collapse, and explore analytical methods like 1/D and small (D-3) expansions.

Method: Numerical construction of critical spacetimes using spherical massless scalar-field collapse in D-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole backgrounds. Analytical 1/D and D-3 expansions were applied to support findings.

Result: Echoing periods and Choptuik exponents as continuous functions of D, with a peak at D≈3.76. Recovered known D=4 values. Suggested vanishing of parameters as D approaches 3, enabling small-(D-3) expansions.

Conclusion: Critical spacetime crystals generalize Choptuik's work to higher dimensions. The results reveal new insights into dimensionality's role in gravitational collapse and provide a framework for future analytical studies in near-critical dimensions.

Abstract: We numerically construct a one-parameter family of critical spacetimes in arbitrary continuous dimensions D>3. This generalizes Choptuik's D=4 solution to spherically symmetric massless scalar-field collapse at the threshold of D-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole formation. We refer to these solutions, which share the discrete self-similarity of their four-dimensional counterpart, as critical spacetime crystals. Our main results are the echoing period and Choptuik exponent of the crystals as continuous functions of D, with detailed data for the interval 3.05<D<5.5. Notably, the echoing period has a maximum near D=3.76. As a by-product, we recover the echoing periods and Choptuik exponents in D=4 (5): Delta=3.445453 (3.22176) and gamma=0.373961 (0.41322). We support these numerical results with analytical expansions in 1/D and D-3. They suggest that both the echoing period and Choptuik exponent vanish as D approaches 3 from above. This paves the way for a small-(D-3) expansion, paralleling the large-$D$ expansion of general relativity. We also extend our results to two-dimensional dilaton gravity.

TL;DR: Scalar field fluctuations in a closed universe with a Compton wavelength exceeding the curvature radius can drive cosmic acceleration, offering new insights into inflation and dark energy through a light boson gas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative mechanisms for cosmic acceleration beyond dark energy and inflation, leveraging scalar field properties in closed universes.

Method: Analyzing scalar field fluctuations in a spatially closed universe where the Compton wavelength of the field is larger than the universe's curvature radius.

Result: Demonstrated that such scalar field conditions can autonomously drive accelerated expansion, potentially unifying explanations for inflation and dark energy via light boson gases.

Conclusion: Closed universes with appropriate boson gases provide a novel framework for understanding cosmic acceleration phases, suggesting a unified origin for early inflation and late-time dark energy.

Abstract: We show that scalar field fluctuations alone can drive cosmic acceleration, provided the universe is spatially closed and the Compton wavelength of the field exceeds the radius of curvature. This mechanism may open new perspectives on inflation and dark energy, which could arise from a gas of sufficiently light bosons in a closed universe.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper analyzes a class of regular black holes formed from polytropic star collapse, showing they are sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics with a magnetic charge. It examines their energy conditions, photon spheres, shadows, thermodynamics, and generalizes collapse scenarios to higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend understanding of regular black holes by exploring a new class that interpolates between known solutions like Bardeen and Hayward, while investigating their physical origins, observational signatures, and thermodynamic behavior.

Method: The study derives the black hole solutions in d-dimensions, analyzes energy conditions, performs analytical and numerical studies of photon spheres and shadow casting, calculates thermodynamic quantities, and generalizes the Oppenheimer-Snyder-Datt collapse model.

Result: Shows the black holes arise from nonlinear electrodynamics with magnetic charge, satisfies energy conditions in certain regimes, produces distinguishable shadow features, exhibits phase transitions in thermodynamics, and successfully models stellar collapse in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: The class of regular black holes provides a robust framework for studying quantum gravity effects, offers testable observational predictions via shadow analysis, and reveals new thermodynamic phenomena in higher-dimensional spacetimes.

Abstract: This paper examines a recently introduced class of regular black holes that can form from the collapse of a polytropic star with an arbitrary polytropic index. This class has a de Sitter core and reduces to the Bardeen and Hayward black holes when the polytropic index is chosen appropriately. We demonstrate that this class of black holes is sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian in $d$ dimensions and that its regularity stems from the presence of magnetic charge. We analyze the energy conditions and study the photon spheres analytically and the shadows numerically. Then, we compare our results with observations. Additionally, we present the thermodynamic properties of this class of black holes, including their temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also examine their thermodynamic stability. Finally, we generalize the Oppenheimer-Snyder-Datt collapse scenario to this $d$-dimensional class of black holes and study stellar collapse into them, as well as the evolution of the star's surface, the apparent horizon, and the event horizon.

### [41] [The measurable impact of the 2pN spin-dependent accelerations on the jet precession of M87$^\ast$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10311)
*Lorenzo Iorio*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper calculates accelerations on an uncharged object in the Kerr metric up to the second post-Newtonian order, revealing new spin-dependent effects on orbital precession. These effects contribute about 20% to the Lense-Thirring precession observed in disks/jets around supermassive black holes like M87*, suggesting measurable second-order spin terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the precise disk/jet coprecessions observed near galactic supermassive black holes, the study examines higher-order relativistic effects beyond the leading-order Lense-Thirring effect.

Method: Analytical calculations of accelerations in harmonic Kerr coordinates, expressed in coordinate-independent vector form. Perturbative analysis using Keplerian orbital elements, averaging over orbital periods to derive averaged precession effects.

Result: New accelerations proportional to both first and second powers of black hole spin affect orbital plane precession at 1/c⁴ order. The first-order spin term contributes ~20% of Lense-Thirring precession, and the second-order term is still potentially measurable. Parameter space analysis for M87* jet precession is provided.

Conclusion: Second-post-Newtonian spin effects are non-negligible for high-precision astrophysical observations like black hole accretion disk/jet precession. These results refine theoretical models needed to interpret current and future high-accuracy measurements.

Abstract: Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate particle production mechanisms in early Universe scenarios and validate them through analog experiments, given the lack of a complete quantum gravity theory and the need for insights from quantum fields on curved spacetime.

Method: The work is divided into four parts: establishing theoretical foundations (Part I), analyzing particle production in inflationary models using scalar/vector fields and tachyonic instabilities (Part II), mapping BEC experiments to expanding universe simulations (Part III), and addressing quantum vacuum ambiguities and non-adiabatic transitions (Part IV).

Showed how BEC experiments can reconstruct expansion histories and measure entanglement in particle pairs. Highlighted challenges in quantum vacuum ambiguities during expansion transitions.

Conclusion: Cosmological particle production is a viable dark matter candidate, and analog experiments with BECs offer powerful tools to study quantum effects in curved spacetimes, advancing our understanding without requiring full quantum gravity theories.

Abstract: This thesis investigates cosmological particle production within Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, both as a dark matter mechanism and through analog simulations using Bose-Einstein condensates. While a full theory of Quantum Gravity remains elusive, studying quantum fields on curved backgrounds provides essential insights into the early Universe. We focus on how dynamical spacetimes, particularly during inflation, generate particles from spectator fields influenced solely by geometry.
  The work is divided into four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the "switch-on" and "switch-off" of expansion.
  Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.

*Adrian Ka-Wai Chung*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents spectral methods to accurately construct spacetimes of rotating black holes with massive scalar fields nonminimally coupled to curvature, enabling precise calculations of horizon properties and opening paths for observational tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ubiquity of massive scalar charges in extended theories of gravity and particle physics, and to enable accurate modeling of black hole spacetimes for testing fundamental physics through electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations.

Method: Spectral methods to solve for spacetimes of rotating black holes with scalar fields (considering axi-dilaton, dynamical Chern-Simons, scalar Gauss-Bonnet couplings), achieving high precision (errors ≤1e-5 for fields, ≤1e-3 for metrics) for scalar wavelengths down to 5 times the black hole mass.

Result: Successful construction of spacetime solutions with quantified errors, calculation of horizon surface gravity and angular velocity shifts, critical for quasinormal mode analysis and observational tests.

Conclusion: These methods provide a foundation for incorporating massive scalar charges into observations, offering new avenues to probe previously inaccessible scalar field theories using black hole data.

Abstract: Massive scalar charges are ubiquitous in extensions to General Relativity and the Standard Model in particle physics. We describe spectral methods which can accurately construct the spacetime of rotating black holes with dimensionless spin up to $a \leq 0.8$ surrounded by massive scalar fields nonminimally coupled to spacetime curvature. We consider axi dilaton, dynamical Chern Simons, and scalar Gauss Bonnet couplings, and obtain leading order solutions for both the scalar field and the associated metric modifications. Our method accurately resolves massive scalar fields with Compton wavelengths as short as 5 times the black hole mass, achieving residual errors $\lesssim 10^{-5}$, and yields the corresponding leading order spacetime modifications with residual errors $\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Using the constructed spacetimes, we computes the leading-order shifts in the surface gravity and the angular velocity of the event horizon, important information for computing the quasinormal modes. These results pave the way to incorporate massive scalar charges into electromagnetic observations and gravitational-wave detections of black holes, potentially enabling new probes of fundamental scalar degrees of freedom.

### [44] [Geometric properties of slowly rotating black holes embedded in matter environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10579)
*Sayak Datta,Chiranjeeb Singha*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study explores how dark matter halos affect the spacetime geometry of rotating black holes, revealing measurable deviations in orbital dynamics and gravitational wave signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of surrounding dark matter and baryonic matter on black hole spacetime, capturing environmental effects in strong-field gravity tests.

Method: Used the slow-rotation approximation to model a black hole embedded in an anisotropic dark matter halo, analyzing leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects analytically.

Result: Found that the halo's rotation modifies frame-dragging, geodesics, light rings, and epicyclic frequencies, creating nonmonotonic behavior in frequency ratios and shifting orbital parameters.

Conclusion: Environmental factors like dark matter halos leave observable imprints on extreme mass-ratio inspirals, crucial for future gravitational wave detector accuracy and testing gravity theories.

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are embedded in surrounding dark and baryonic matter that can measurably perturb the spacetime. We construct a self-consistent spacetime describing a slowly rotating black hole embedded in an external matter distribution, modeling the surrounding dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid. Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.

*Serkan Doruk Hazinedar,Yaghoub Heydarzade,Shahram Jalalzadeh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores early-time quantum cosmological dynamics in f(R, T) gravity, using Schutz's formalism to derive a self-emerging time parameter from matter-sector dynamics. It derives the SWDW equation and analyzes the wave function for specific models, emphasizing matter-geometry coupling's role in quantum universe evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the coupling between geometry and matter in f(R, T) gravity influences early-universe quantum dynamics, potentially offering alternatives to standard inflation models without relying on dark energy.

Method: Analyzes FLRW universe within f(R, T) framework using Schutz's perfect fluid formalism to extract internal time parameter. Derives gravitational Hamiltonian, canonical momenta, potential, and SWDW equation. Computes wave functions for specific f(R, T) forms and compares with f(R) results.

Result: Demonstrates matter-geometry coupling significantly impacts quantum cosmological dynamics, showing how specific models generate universe wave functions that differ from standard f(R) gravity. Highlights how internal time parameterization emerges naturally from matter-sector contributions.

Conclusion: f(R, T) gravity's matter-geometry coupling provides a novel mechanism for shaping quantum early-universe dynamics, offering insights into time's origin from matter fluctuations and presenting a viable alternative framework for cosmic evolution studies.

Abstract: The $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity extends general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational Lagrangian to depend on both the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. The resulting matter-geometry coupling introduces additional dynamical effects that may account for the late-time acceleration of the universe without invoking dark energy. In the present work, we focus instead on the early-time regime and investigate the corresponding quantum cosmological dynamics. We analyze a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universe within the $f(R, T)$ framework, employing Schutz's perfect fluid formalism to extract a time parameter emerging from the matter sector itself. This approach is particularly well motivated in $f(R, T)$ gravity, where the coupling between geometry and the energy-momentum tensor's trace makes matter an active participant in the dynamics of spacetime and the evolution of cosmic time. The gravitational Hamiltonian, canonical momenta, and potential are derived, leading to the corresponding Schrödinger--Wheeler--DeWitt (SWDW) equation. The wave function of the universe is obtained for specific forms of $f(R, T)$, and the results are compared with previous studies in $f(R)$ and $f(R, T)$ models, highlighting the role of matter-geometry coupling in the emergence of quantum cosmological dynamics.

Abstract: We present the first fully non-linear evolutions of binary neutron star mergers in a moving-punctures approach in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We study both linear and quadratic-type couplings between the scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, and uncover new post-merger phenomena. These include an enhancement of the prompt collapse of a long-lived hyper-massive neutron star remnant and cases where the remnant develops a scalar configuration due to different scalarisation instabilities. This study initiates the exploration of beyond-General-Relativistic effects enhanced by the non-linear dynamics of the neutron star's fluid.

### [47] [Exact Dynamical Regular Black Holes from Generalized Polytropic Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10768)
*Dmitriy Kudryavcev,Yi Ling,Vitalii Vertogradov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents exact, dynamical, analytic solutions for regular black holes formed from gravitational collapse under a generalized polytropic equation of state. By modifying the Vaidya-type metric with a radially dependent mass function, they regularize Kiselev solutions to create nonsingular spacetimes with a de Sitter core.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the singularity problem in classical black hole solutions by providing a regularization method that yields nonsingular spacetimes through physically motivated modifications to energy density profiles.

Method: Adopts a Vaidya-type geometry with a radially dependent mass function and a generalized polytropic equation of state (P=αρ−ζρ^γ). The regularization process modifies energy density to achieve finite curvature invariants at the center, leading to de Sitter cores. They generalize Hayward and Bardeen solutions as specific cases.

Result: Exact dynamical solutions unify multiple regular black hole models. A universal constraint links regularization scale to mass function, ensuring curvature in the core is mass-independent. Solutions support consistent effective-matter interpretations via the polytropic equation.

Conclusion: The approach provides a unified analytic framework for regular black holes from collapse processes, resolving central singularities while maintaining consistency with known solutions like Hayward and Bardeen spacetimes.

Abstract: We present a class of exact, dynamical, and fully analytic solutions describing regular black holes formed via the gravitational collapse of matter obeying a generalized polytropic equation of state. Starting from a Vaidya-type geometry with a radially dependent mass function, we demonstrate that regularization of the Kiselev solutions can be achieved through a physically motivated modification of the energy density profile. This procedure leads to nonsingular spacetimes with a de~Sitter core and finite curvature invariants at the center.
  We show that the resulting matter content is naturally described by a generalized polytropic equation of state of the form $P=αρ-ζρ^γ$, where the polytropic index $γ$ is uniquely determined by the regularization scheme. Within this framework, we obtain exact dynamical generalizations of several well-known regular black hole solutions, including the Hayward and Bardeen spacetimes, as particular cases corresponding to specific values of the polytropic parameters.
  Remarkably, the requirement that the equation of state remains coordinate independent imposes a universal constraint relating the regularization scale to the mass function, which in turn guarantees the existence of a regular de~Sitter core with a curvature scale independent of the black hole mass. Our results provide a unified analytic description of Hayward-like and Bardeen-like black holes emerging from gravitational collapse, offering a consistent effective-matter interpretation rooted in generalized polytropic matter.

### [48] [Dust collapse and bounce in spherically symmetric quantum-inspired gravity models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10804)
*Douglas M. Gingrich*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines quantum gravity effects in the collapse of inhomogeneous dust, showing that quantum contributions can halt collapse and induce a bounce, preventing singularities. The authors use covariant Hamiltonian constraints to model spherical systems and analyze existing/new bounce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether quantum-inspired gravity models can avert the formation of spacetime singularities during gravitational collapse by inducing a bounce, extending beyond classical predictions.

Method: Develops a covariant Hamiltonian formalism for spherically symmetric spacetimes with non-homogeneous dust, derives equations for dust boundary motion and apparent horizons, applies this framework to various quantum-inspired gravity models.

Result: Demonstrates that quantum corrections consistently halt dust collapse at a minimal radius, producing a bounce. Both replicates known results via new methods and identifies novel bounce conditions in specific models.

Conclusion: Quantum effects in gravity models provide a viable mechanism to resolve classical singularities through collapse termination and bounce. The method offers a versatile tool for analyzing gravitational collapse across different quantum gravity proposals.

Abstract: We study the collapse and possible bounce of dust in quantum-inspired gravity models with spherical symmetry. Starting from a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, we write down the covariant Hamiltonian constraints that under dynamical flow give rise to metrics of many spherically symmetric gravity models. Gravity is minimally coupled to a dust field. The constraint equations are solved for the Hamiltonian evolution and simple equations for the location of the outer boundary of the dust versus time and the apparent horizons in terms of shape functions are obtained. The dust density is not assumed to be homogeneous inside the collapsing ball. In many cases, the effective quantum gravity effects stop the collapse of the dust matter field, then causes the dust field to expand thus creating a bounce at a minimum radius and avoiding the classical singularity. Using this formalism, we examine several quantum-inspired gravity metrics to obtain bounce results either previously obtained by different methods or new results.
