Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Our ability to infer the true source properties of colliding black holes from
gravitational wave observations requires not only accurate waveform models but
also their correct use. A key property when evaluating time-domain models is
when to start the waveform: choosing a time that is too late can omit
low-frequency power from higher order multipoles. By focusing on binary systems
with total mass $\ge 200 \, M_{\odot}$, we show that current detectors are
sensitive to this missing power and biased source properties can be obtained.
We show that for systems with total mass $\lesssim 300 \, M_{\odot}$, mass
ratio $\gtrsim 0.33$, and signal-to-noise ratio $\rho \gtrsim 20$, templates
starting at $20 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased source properties. As the total
mass increases, and the component masses become more asymmetric, templates
starting from $13 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased properties. If the
gravitational-wave signal is observed at signal-to-noise ratio $\rho < 20$,
time-domain models can start from $20\, \mathrm{Hz}$ as statistical
uncertainties dominate.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The effect of dissipation from the thermal bath of minimal warm inflation
(MWI) on the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
is investigated. A shift in the phase and peaks of the theoretical TT mode
angular power spectrum of CMB for MWI with increasing dissipation strength
hints at the dynamical nature of dark energy from warm inflation. Outcome of
the study highlights the necessity of modifying the cosmological parameters,
signalling a physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. The
current findings may open a new direction for explaining the increased
expansion rate in the early universe, thus alleviating some of the persistent
tensions in cosmology, especially the Hubble tension.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The static antiscalar solution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations in the
form of the Papapetrou exponential metric had been interpreted as a traversable
wormhole with a throat at \textit{r=M}. We aim to search for the effects which
could be associated with this scale and only find that the topological
Gauss-Bonnet invariant swaps sign, and the value of the Keplerian frequency for
circular geodesics becomes singular. At the same time, the geometric invariants
of the curvature tensor have extremal values at the scale twice less than that
of the throat, revealing new physical effects. In particular, the Ricci scalar
at \textit{r=M/2} (rather than \textit{r=M}) is associated with the extremal
values of thermodynamic characteristics of the scalar background. This approach
in combination with the antiscalar static limit of the Einstein-Maxwell
equations suggests the interpretation of the scalar background as a stable
medium with a stiff equation of state, formed by the neutral superposition of
ambient quasistatic electric fields.

### [4] [Anisotropic Dark Matter Bosonic Stars in regularized 4D Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15549)
*Mohamamd Mazhari*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper constructs anisotropic bosonic dark-matter star solutions in regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, analyzing their mass-radius relations and stability. It finds that positive Gauss-Bonnet coupling increases maximum mass and compactness, while negative anisotropy reduces them, with configurations remaining stable under physical criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous studies on isotropic boson stars by incorporating anisotropy in a regularized 4D EGB framework, exploring how Gauss-Bonnet corrections and anisotropy parameters affect dark-matter star properties and observational predictions under modified gravity.

Method: Solved modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for a self-interacting complex scalar field in the dilute polytropic regime using dimensional regularization. Parameterized anisotropy as σ = β p_r (1 - e^{-2λ}) and performed numerical analysis over (α, β) ranges to evaluate mass-radius relations and stability indicators like dM/dp_c, causality, Γ_r, and energy conditions.

Result: Positive α (Gauss-Bonnet coupling) increased M_max from ~1.62 to 2.09 M☉ and compactness; negative β decreased M_max from ~2.21 to 1.73 M☉. Configurations remained stable up to mass peaks, satisfying all physical criteria. Extended previous isotropic analyses to anisotropic cases in regularized 4D EGB.

Conclusion: Anisotropic boson stars in regularized 4D EGB gravity show significant modifications to mass and compactness, offering observationally testable predictions for compact dark-matter objects. The framework provides a robust model for studying dark matter under modified gravity scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we have constructed anisotropic bosonic dark-matter star (DMS)
solutions in the context of a regularized four-dimensional
Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity theory. Using dimensional
regularization, we solve modified Tolman$-$Oppenheimer$-$Volkoff equations for
a self-interacting complex scalar field in the dilute polytropic regime, $p_r =
K \rho^2$, with anisotropy parameterized as $\sigma = \beta\, p_r \left( 1 -
e^{-2\lambda} \right)$. We perform a comprehensive numerical analysis across
the \((\alpha,\beta)\) parameter domain, where \(\alpha \in
[0,8]~\mathrm{km}^2\) and \(\beta \in [-2,0]\), to examine mass$-$radius
relations and evaluate multiple stability indicators including static
equilibrium \(dM/dp_c\), sound-speed causality, the radial adiabatic index
\(\Gamma_r\), and energy conditions. Positive Gauss$-$Bonnet coupling enhances
both the maximum mass and compactness (e.g., \(M_{\rm max} \approx 1.62\,
M_\odot\) at \(\alpha=0\) rising to \(\approx 2.09\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha =
8~\mathrm{km}^2\)), while negative anisotropy reduces them (e.g., from
\(\approx 2.21\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta=0\) to \(\approx 1.73\, M_\odot\) at
\(\beta = -2\)). The resulting configurations remain statically stable up to
the mass peak and satisfy physical criteria. This work extends previous
isotropic boson-star analyses by systematically incorporating anisotropy within
a regularized 4D EGB framework. These findings provide observationally relevant
predictions for compact dark-matter objects under modified gravity.

### [5] [Signals from Fermionic inflationary cosmology with Yukawa interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15609)
*Lin-Hong Sui,Dan Li,Jia-Ze Sun,Xi-Bin Li*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines an inflationary model where a Dirac field is coupled to a scalar inflaton via a Yukawa interaction. The study finds that the Yukawa coupling strength affects the tensor-to-scalar ratio differently depending on the effective mass parameter, which could have observable implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how Yukawa interactions between Dirac fermions and inflatons influence inflationary dynamics and observational predictions like the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

Method: Analytical solutions of Dirac equations under slow-roll conditions were derived to study fermion pair density and its impact on inflationary parameters, particularly the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

Result: For large effective mass (tilde m ≳ 1), the tensor-to-scalar ratio is suppressed (by ~1/(1+2.95π²g²)) with significant backreaction, while for small tilde m, results align with standard cold inflation predictions.

Conclusion: The Yukawa coupling's strength and effective mass critically determine inflationary observables, offering a testable framework under current observational constraints.

Abstract: We investigate an inflationary model wherein the Dirac field $\psi$ is
directly coupled to a scalar inflaton $\phi$ via a Yukawa interaction
$g\phi\bar\psi\psi$ and examine the resulting observational implications.
Within the slow-roll approximation, we derive analytical solutions of the Dirac
equations during inflation. The analytical result on the fermion pair density
$\langle n\rangle$ indicates that the Yukawa interaction strength $g$ is to
characterize the degree of non-adiabaticity. For large value of the
dimensionless effective mass $\tilde m=(m+g\phi)/H$, i.e. $\tilde m\gtrsim 1$,
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is suppressed by a factor of approximately
$1/(1+2.95\pi^2g^2)$. This condition is also characterized by a significant
backreaction. Conversely, if $\tilde m \ll 1$, the value of $r$ remains
consistent with that observed in standard cold inflation. Our analysis is
performed under the assumption of the highest inflationary energy scales
compatible with current observational constraints.

Abstract: We consider massless scalar field perturbations of regular black holes in
quasi-topological gravity. After reviewing various regular black hole
solutions, we compute the total absorption cross-section and the partial
absorption cross-section for different choices of the parameters using the
partial wave method. The results show that the larger the parameter ${\alpha}$,
introduced in the context of quasi-topological gravity, the smaller the total
absorption cross-section. In addition, we find that the influence of the
space-time dimension ${D}$ on the absorption and scattering of massless scalar
waves in this set of regular black holes differs from earlier computations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper explores the metric of Piero Nicolini's noncommutative black hole
spacetime, calculates its effective potential, and presents the corresponding
potential curve. By analyzing this curve, we identify various orbit types for
test particles and photons in this spacetime. Using the dynamical equations for
particles and photons near the black hole, we plot the specific time-like and
null geodesic structures. We analyze the impact of different values of the
total mass of the source $M$ and angular momentum $L$ on time-like geodesics.
Our results indicate that in the Piero black hole spacetime, increases in total
mass and angular momentum reduce the perihelion precession rate of the orbit.
Notably, the effect of total mass is nonlinear, while the effect of angular
momentum is linear.

### [8] [Relativistic tidal divergences in circular orbits and the dynamics of light rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15705)
*Victor F. C. Vieira,Rafael P. Bernar,Caio F. B. Macedo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines relativistic tidal forces on ultracompact objects from observers in circular orbits, finding tidal forces diverge near null geodesics, with implications for object stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how tidal forces behave around ultracompact horizonless objects and their impact on structural stability through relativistic effects.

Method: Analysis of static/spherically symmetric spacetimes using circular geodesic observers, with case studies of uniform-density stars (isotropic and tangentially stressed).

Result: Tidal forces diverge as orbits approach light rings, contrasting with radial orbits. This divergence is observed in both stellar models studied.

Conclusion: The divergence near light rings may indicate tidal instabilities affecting the nonlinear stability of ultracompact objects without event horizons.

Abstract: Tidal forces acting on orbiting bodies arise from inhomogeneities in the
gravitational field, generating stresses that can deform or even disrupt these
objects. In this work, we analyze relativistic tidal forces associated with
ultracompact objects described by static and spherically symmetric spacetimes,
focusing on observers in circular geodesic motion. We show that, in contrast to
the case of radial geodesics, tidal forces diverge as the orbit approaches null
circular geodesics. As illustrative examples, we study two uniform-density
stellar models: one isotropic and another supported purely by tangential
stresses. We conjecture that the divergence of tidal forces near light rings
may play a role in the nonlinear stability of ultracompact, horizonless
objects.

### [9] [Scalar fields with power-law potentials in quantum cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15735)
*V. E. Kuzmichev,V. V. Kuzmichev*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates a quantum cosmological model with a scalar field having a power-law potential, deriving analytical solutions for the quantum Hamiltonian constraint equations under different barotropic matter domination scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the quantum behavior of a homogeneous and isotropic universe dominated by various forms of barotropic matter through a unified scalar field framework.

Method: The authors use quantum geometrodynamics for maximally symmetric spaces, breaking down the scalar field's power-law potential into components. They formulate differential equations for each potential term and solve the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian constraint equations analytically.

Result: Analytical solutions were obtained for the quantum equations under different matter domination epochs, including stiff matter, radiation, dust, etc., showing how the universe's quantum state evolves under these conditions.

Conclusion: The derived solutions provide insights into quantum cosmological dynamics across various matter eras, offering a comprehensive framework to study transitions between different barotropic matter-dominated phases in the early universe.

Abstract: A homogeneous and isotropic quantum cosmological system (universe) initially
filled with a uniform scalar field that has a potential in the power law
representation is considered. Depending on the epoch, this scalar field yields
barotropic matter in the form of stiff matter, perfect gas, radiation, dust,
cosmic strings, domain walls, de Sitter vacuum, or phantom matter. The proposed
approach is based on quantum geometrodynamics for the maximally symmetric
space. The relevant differential equations for the separate power-law summands
of the scalar field potential and the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian
constraint equations, which describe the universe that can be viewed as
dominated by one form or another of barotropic matter, were obtained. The
solutions to these equations have been found in analytical form.

### [10] [Unified field theory from Hamilton cotangent bundle geometry - The Einstein-Maxwell system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15812)
*Christian Pfeifer,José Javier Relancio*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a geometric unification of physical fields by encoding them into the phase space geometry using a scalar Hamiltonian field, showing equivalence to Einstein-Maxwell equations and offering a framework for further field unification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve the long-standing goal of unifying all physical fields into a single mathematical framework by leveraging phase space geometry, differing from previous unification attempts.

Method: Encoding physical fields into the cotangent bundle's geometry via Hamiltonian scalar fields, constructing an action principle, and demonstrating equivalence to Einstein-Maxwell equations through a specific Hamiltonian for charged particles in curved spacetime.

Result: Shows that the derived phase-space scalar field equation matches the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations, unifying gravity and electromagnetism geometrically, and suggests potential for unifying other fields.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel phase space geometry approach as a promising path for fundamental physics unification, highlighting its distinction from past methods and scalability for additional physical fields.

Abstract: The unification of all physical fields into one mathematical object and the
derivation of all physical field equations from that object in one framework is
a long-lasting endeavor in fundamental physics. We suggest a new approach to
achieve this goal by encoding physical fields into the geometry of the
1-particle phase space on spacetime (the cotangent bundle) through Hamilton
geometry. The fundamental field, which contains information about all physical
fields in spacetime and defines the phase space geometry, is a scalar field in
phase space that is interpreted as a point-particle Hamiltonian. We construct
an action principle for scalar fields in phase space and derive the
corresponding scalar field equation. By choosing a specific scalar field,
namely the Hamiltonian describing a charged particle in curved spacetime with
an electromagnetic field, we show that this phase-space scalar field equation
is equivalent to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations in spacetime, thus
providing a geometric unification of gravity and electromagnetism. We further
discuss how this approach differs from previous unification attempts and its
potential for describing further physical fields and their dynamics in a
unified manner in terms of phase-space geometry.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: How important are gravitational and relativistic effects for interstellar
travel? We consider this question in the context of proposed laser-propelled
spacecraft missions to neighboring stellar destinations. Our analysis applies
to any spacecraft traveling at relativistic speeds. As a concrete example, we
focus on a mission to Proxima Centauri b -- a terrestrial-sized planet in the
habitable zone around our nearest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri. We employ
a Julia reimplementation of the PoMiN code, an N-body code modeling
relativistic gravitational dynamics in the first post-Minkowskian (PM)
approximation to general relativity (valid to linear order in Newton's constant
$G$). We compute the gravitational influence of seven different celestial
bodies and find that the Sun has the greatest influence on the trajectory of
the interstellar spacecraft. We also study the differences between Newtonian
and PM gravity, and find that if mission planners wish to hit Proxima Centauri
b with an accuracy of better than about 690,000 kilometers, relativistic
effects must be taken into account. To solve for the precise initial data
needed to hit an intended target, we develop numerical fine-tuning methods and
demonstrate that these methods can (within a given model) be precise to about a
femtometer over a travel distance of $\sim4.25$ light years. However, we find
that for the spacecraft trajectories we consider, higher order general
relativistic effects (beyond the first PM approximation) from the Sun can
displace the final position of the spacecraft by tens of kilometers. We also
consider the variation in the initial direction of the spacecraft velocity and
find that, even with relativistic effects properly taken into account, the miss
distances can be dominated by the variation in the initial velocity that could
arise from errors during the launch and boost phase of the spacecraft mission.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized
arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the
operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are
designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality
images of the sky.
  Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary
geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically
infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper,
we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio
interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full
array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is
suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the
proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency
interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the
detected RFI.

### [13] [HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image reconstruction in radio interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15198)
*Chao Tang,Arwa Dabbech,Adrian Jackson,Yves Wiaux*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: HyperAIRI is a hyperspectral extension of the AIRI algorithm for next-generation radio-interferometric telescopes, using learned denoisers with power-law spectral models and Jacobian regularization to achieve high-resolution imaging across spectral channels. It outperforms existing methods like Hyper-uSARA and WSClean.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-gen RI telescopes need algorithms to handle large, wideband data for high-res, high-dynamic-range imaging. Existing methods lack efficient spectral channel handling and scalability.

Method: HyperAIRI employs a forward-backward framework with learned hyperspectral denoisers that incorporate neighboring spectral channels and spectral index maps. Jacobian regularization ensures convergence. A denoiser shelf with pre-trained models for varying dynamic ranges allows parallel processing. Spatial faceting enables scalability.

Result: Outperforms Hyper-uSARA, WSClean, AIRI, and uSARA in simulated and real datasets, showing better recovery of faint sources and dynamic range.

Conclusion: HyperAIRI's learned denoising approach with spectral collaboration and adaptive dynamic range handling is superior for hyperspectral RI imaging, demonstrating potential for future telescopes like SKA.

Abstract: The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging
algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from
large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a
plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure
(FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging
by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularisation step via learned
denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension,
underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral
model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its
current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighbouring
channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated
denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained
with a Jacobian regularisation enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate
varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each
tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral
channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using
dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are
also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability
to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a
variant of the optimisation-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity
across spectral channels via the l2,1-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate
HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its
superior performance compared to its optimisation-based counterpart
Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic
imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.

### [14] [Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315)
*Yicun Duan,Xinyue Li,Camille Avestruz,Jeffrey Regier*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes using neural posterior estimation (NPE), a Bayesian inference method, for astronomical cataloging with LSST data, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cataloging methods lack statistical coherence, and existing probabilistic approaches are computationally inefficient or unable to handle multiband coadded images. LSST's upcoming data volume requires a more efficient and accurate solution.

Method: NPE utilizes deep learning to approximate posteriors for cataloging, addressing the ill-posedness of the problem while enabling analysis of multiband images. Tested on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey.

Result: NPE outperformed the standard LSST pipeline in detection, flux measurement, classification, and shape measurement, with well-calibrated posteriors. Performance degraded with model misspecification but mitigation strategies exist.

Conclusion: NPE shows promise for LSST cataloging despite potential model misspecification in real data, suggesting its viability with appropriate adjustments.

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will
commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of
astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged
stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific
workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic
cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed
problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational
inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband
coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we
explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior
estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to
achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the
DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to
mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in
light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and
galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior
approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data,
illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification.
Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application
of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its
effects.

Abstract: With the growing number of gamma-ray monitors in operation, several research
teams have adopted a strategy of joint operation and scientific duty to improve
efficiency. A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation
collaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor
constellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates
(BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the
frequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among
different missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current
requirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a
customized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty,
named "BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and
Summary Tools" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated,
semi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of
prompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while
maintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of
BREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST
also aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes
through rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge
between prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a
suite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly
the specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on
prompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been
demonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a
significant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the
future.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers
incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor
instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model
physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor
conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies,
and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to
$300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields,
especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions
unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist
despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the
equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor
conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the
neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to
stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation
between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the
potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve
on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Gradus.jl, an open-source and publicly available general
relativistic ray-tracing toolkit for spectral modelling in arbitrary
spacetimes. Our software is written in the Julia programming language, making
use of forward-mode automatic differentiation for computing the Christoffel
symbols during geodesic integration, and for propagating derivatives through
the entire ray-tracer. Relevant numerical methods are detailed, and our models
are validated using a number of tests and comparisons to other codes. The
differentiability is used to optimally calculate Cunningham transfer functions
-- used to efficiently pre-compute relativistic effects in spectral models. A
method is described for calculating such transfer functions for disc with
non-zero vertical height, including the treatment of self-obscuration. An
extension of the transfer function formalism that includes timing information
is described, and used to calculate high-resolution reverberation lag spectra
for a lamppost corona. The lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra for a
Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc with various lamppost heights and Eddington
ratios are calculated, and the general impact of disc thickness in reflection
models is discussed.

Abstract: Disc accretion onto astrophysical objects with a material surface proceeds
through the boundary layer (BL) -- a radially narrow region in the inner disc
where the incoming gas must slow down its rotation before settling onto the
surface of the accretor. Here we numerically study a BL in which the angular
momentum transport in the layer is accomplished via the excitation of global
acoustic waves. While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically
modeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal
sphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other
internal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the
inner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower
increase of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object.
While the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner
orbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic
index $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular
momentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in
amplitude as $n$ is lowered. Interestingly, in 2D these transport metrics are
better correlated not with $n$ but with a total mass inside the central object
contained within the simulation domain. These results improve our understanding
of the wave-mediated BL accretion by quantifying the effect of the inner
structure of the accretor on the excitation and propagation of acoustic modes
mediating the BL transport.

*Y. Sultan Abylkairov,Matthew C. Edwards,Artyom Ostrikov,Yersultan Tleukhanov,Alejandro Torres-Forné,Pablo Cerdá-Durán,José Antonio Font,Marek J. Szczepańczyk,Ernazar Abdikamalov*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores using gravitational wave (GW) signals from core-collapse supernovae to infer the equation of state (EOS) of high-density matter. Using machine learning (support vector machine), they analyze 18 EOS models and find that advanced detectors like Einstein Telescope can probe these signals, offering upper limits on EOS determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage GW observations from rotating core-collapse supernovae for testing the EOS of dense nuclear matter, crucial for understanding neutron star interiors and high-energy astrophysics.

Method: Simulated GW bounce signals from rotating supernovae using 18 EOS models. Applied a support vector machine classifier to distinguish EOS-based GW signatures. Evaluated detector sensitivity for Advanced LIGO A+ and 3G detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer).

Result: Optimally oriented sources can be probed by Advanced LIGO for Galactic events, while 3G detectors enable extended ranges. Random orientations require next-gen detectors. Results are upper limits due to simplifying assumptions.

Conclusion: Future gravitational wave observatories, especially third-generation ones, hold significant potential for EOS inference from supernovae GW signals, despite current limitations in modeling complexities.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of
the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on
the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore
its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously
shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated
for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the
Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while
third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic
Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only
these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity.
These results represent the potential observational range for probing the
nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should
be regarded as approximate upper limits.

### [20] [Universal Relations for Elastic Hybrid Stars and Quark Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15149)
*Chun-Ming Yip,Shu Yan Lau,Kent Yagi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether hybrid or quark stars with crystalline color superconducting quark matter (exhibiting elasticity via pressure anisotropy) follow the universal relations observed in fluid stars. It finds that while the I-λ₂-Q relations show slightly higher variability (~2-3%) compared to fluid stars, uncertainties related to compactness remain similar. This supports the validity of these relations for elastic stars with realistic quark matter elasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to test the robustness of universal relations in neutron stars when including elastic effects from crystalline color superconducting quark matter. Previous studies assumed fluid stars, but realistic quark matter may have elasticity, so it's critical to assess how this affects stellar properties and universal relations.

Method: The authors modeled elastic hybrid/quark stars with pressure anisotropy caused by background shear in quark matter. Using general relativistic equations, they calculated moment of inertia (I), tidal deformability (λ₂), and spin-induced quadrupole moment (Q). They compared the resulting I-λ₂-Q relations for elastic stars to fluid star benchmarks.

Result: Universal relations for elastic stars showed ~2-3% variation (greater than fluid stars' ~1%) when considering realistic quark shear moduli. However, compactness-related uncertainties were comparable to fluid stars. This indicates that even with elasticity, the relations hold within observable limits.

Conclusion: Universal relations remain valid for hybrid/quark stars with crystalline color superconducting quark matter when considering realistic elasticity. The increased variability in I-λ₂-Q relations is within acceptable bounds, supporting their use in astrophysical observations despite pressure anisotropy.

Abstract: Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars
or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the
crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to
noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether
these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive
to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We
improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background,
static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background
shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then
calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\lambda}_2$, and
spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy.
The $I$-${\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark)
star models are valid up to a variation of $\approx2\,(3)\%$, larger than that
for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear
modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from
realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the
stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain
comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the
validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a
realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color
superconducting quark matter.

*Rodrigo Guedes Lang,Tim Unbehaun,Lars Mohrmann,Simon Steinmassl,Jim Hinton,Stefan Funk*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel analysis method for combining data from both large and small H.E.S.S. telescopes to expand the energy detection range and improve sensitivity, demonstrated using Crab Nebula data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of combining different telescope types and trigger strategies in the H.E.S.S. system and achieve broader energy coverage with higher sensitivity.

Method: The analysis categorizes events into three types based on Hillas parameters, allowing effective use of both monoscopic (large telescopes) and stereoscopic (small telescopes) data across all energy ranges.

Result: The new method provides 25-45% improved sensitivity across most energies, lowers the energy threshold, and demonstrates broader energy coverage compared to existing methods. Validation with Crab Nebula data shows success.

Conclusion: The proposed analysis enhances IACT performance by integrating diverse telescope data, setting a robust framework for future high-energy astrophysics experiments.

Abstract: Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are the main technique for
detecting gamma rays with energies between tens of GeV and hundreds of TeV.
Amongst them, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) has pioneered the
use of different telescope types to achieve an energy range as broad as
possible. A large, 28 m diameter telescope is used in monoscopic mode to access
the lowest energies ($E \gtrsim 30$ GeV), while the four smaller, 12 m diameter
telescopes are used in stereoscopic mode to study energies between 150 GeV and
100 TeV. Nevertheless, a combination of both telescope types and trigger
strategies has proven to be challenging. In this work, we propose for the first
time an analysis based on event types capable of exploiting both telescope
types, trigger strategies, and the whole energy range of the experiment. Due to
the large differences between monoscopic and stereoscopic reconstructions, the
types are defined based on Hillas parameters of individual events, resulting in
three types (Type M, Type B, and Type A), each dominating over a different
energy range. The performances of the new analysis configurations are compared
to the standard configurations in the H.E.S.S. Analysis Package (HAP), Mono and
Stereo. The proposed analysis provides optimal sensitivity over the whole
energy range, in contrast to Mono and Stereo, which focus on smaller energy
ranges. On top of that, improvements in sensitivity of 25-45% are found for
most of the energy range. The analysis is validated using real data from the
Crab Nebula, showing the application to data of an IACT analysis capable of
combining significantly different telescope types with significantly different
energy ranges. Larger energy coverage, lower energy threshold, smaller
statistical uncertainty, and more robustness are observed. The need for a
run-by-run correction for the observation conditions is also highlighted.

*Zitao Hu,Xue-Ning Bai,Xiaochen Sun*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an MHD-gPIC method combining thermal fluid and high-energy particles in the Athena++ code, validated through numerical tests and applied to non-relativistic magnetic reconnection studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is negligible, improving upon existing methods by integrating particle dynamics through guiding center equations with drift motion and backreaction terms.

Method: The MHD-gPIC method couples magnetohydrodynamic equations with a particle-in-cell approach for high-energy particles under the guiding center approximation, including drift motion and source terms for backreaction in the Athena++ code.

Result: The method was validated via numerical tests. Preliminary simulations show promise for studying particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.

Conclusion: The MHD-gPIC model provides a robust framework for investigating particle dynamics in plasma systems without gyro-resonance, paving the way for future studies of astrophysical phenomena like magnetic reconnection.

Abstract: We present the formulation, algorithm and numerical tests of the
magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method with particles treated
under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and
it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of
thermal (cold) fluid and high-energy particles whose dynamics are integrated
through guiding center equations including drift motion, with carefully
evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a
series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study
particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is
considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle
acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents near-infrared follow-up observations of the gravitational wave event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. Five candidate counterparts were identified, but none matched the expected kilonova properties. The study highlights the value of deep NIR surveys and the need for better reference images and understanding of Galactic transients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gravitational wave event S240422ed was initially thought to be a black hole-neutron star merger with high probability of electromagnetic counterparts, motivating a timely NIR follow-up to detect potential kilonovae.

Method: Observations began 7.8 hours post-event, covering 206 nearby galaxies in Y and K_s bands over two nights, reaching depths of 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3σ). Analysis included transient classification using color/time decay characteristics.

Result: Five candidates were found; four matched known transients (supernovae/dwarf novae), one showed ambiguous red color and rapid fading. The GW event was later reclassified as likely noise, underscoring the importance of rigorous electromagnetic follow-ups.

Conclusion: Deep NIR follow-up observations effectively constrain red kilonovae out to 200 Mpc. Future surveys require improved NIR reference images and better models of Galactic transient contaminants to enhance detection confidence.

Abstract: We report our near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the gravitational
wave (GW) event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. S240422ed was
initially classified as a black hole-neutron star merger with $>$ 99%
probability of electromagnetic wave emission. We started follow-up observations
7.8 hours after the event. Over two nights, we observed 206 nearby galaxies in
$Y$ and $K_{\rm s}$ bands down to about 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3$\sigma$),
respectively. The total completeness of our survey based on galaxy $B$-band
luminosity is 22%. As a result of our observations, five candidate counterparts
were identified. We show that properties of these five objects are not
consistent with kilonova such as AT2017gfo. Four objects are consistent with
known classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the
other hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and
rapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal
reclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations
provide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate
that deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would
effectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We
also discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of
understanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients.

### [24] [Sensitivity of Nuclear Reaction Rates in X-ray Burst Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15441)
*I. Sultana,A. Estrade,B. S. Meyer,H. Schatz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how uncertainties in charged-particle reaction rates affect Type I X-ray burst models, identifying key reactions impacting light curves and ashes. The study uses a semi-analytic framework and ONEZONE model to evaluate 228 reactions, highlighting bottlenecks in alpha-p and rp-process paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address nuclear physics uncertainties limiting accurate modeling of XRB light curves and ashes, particularly in varying accretion rates and fuel compositions.

Method: Two-stage approach: semi-analytic framework with reaction network for ignition conditions, followed by ONEZONE sensitivity analysis with varied reaction rates. Evaluated reactions across He-rich and mixed H/He bursts.

Result: 41 reactions affect light curves, 187 impact final abundances. Bottleneck reactions on medium/heavy nuclei influence composition, while rp-process reactions at higher masses affect heavier elements. Identified critical reactions for 12C yield in He-rich bursts linked to superbursts.

Conclusion: Key reactions identified as priorities for experimental nuclear physics to improve XRB model accuracy, especially those影响12C in superburst ignition mechanisms.

Abstract: Type I X-ray bursts (XRBs) are thermonuclear runaways on the surface of
accreting neutron stars, powered by rapid proton-capture and alpha-capture
processes on neutron-deficient nuclei. Uncertainties in the corresponding
reaction rates remain a major limitation in modeling burst light curves and
ashes. We present a systematic study of the sensitivity of XRB models to
uncertainties in charged-particle-induced reaction rates across a broad
parameter space of accretion rates and fuel compositions in low-mass X-ray
binaries. The study proceeds in two stages: ignition conditions are first
determined with a semi-analytic framework coupled to a full reaction network,
followed by a sensitivity analysis using the ONEZONE model with individual rate
variations. We identify 41 reactions that alter the burst light curve and 187
that significantly impact final abundances. Reactions on bottleneck isotopes in
the alpha-p- and rp-process paths strongly affect both observables, while most
(p, gamma) reactions on medium-mass (A > 32) and heavy-mass (A > 55) nuclei
influence only the final composition. Medium-mass cases dominate in He-rich
bursts, where the reaction flow terminates earlier, while heavy-mass cases
appear in mixed H and He bursts with extended rp-process paths reaching A ~
110. We identify a subset of reactions whose rate uncertainties exert influence
on the final 12C yield in helium-rich bursts, which could have important
consequences for the mechanism of ignition of carbon superbursts. Our results
identify key targets for nuclear reaction experiments to reduce nuclear physics
uncertainties in XRB models.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper discusses the challenges and methodologies for detecting strong gravitational-wave lensing using Bayesian and frequentist approaches, emphasizing the posterior odds' insensitivity to event numbers once time delays are accounted for.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the detection of gravitational-wave lensing, particularly the 'birthday problem' increasing false alarms, and unify different methodological approaches under Bayesian framework.

Method: The authors unify frequentist and Bayesian approaches in Bayesian language, derive posterior odds for strong lensing, and analyze the role of selection effects and Bayes factor normalization.

Result: The posterior odds for strong lensing are found insensitive to the number of events when time delays are considered, and selection effects only affect the Bayes factor's normalization, which cancels in posterior odds and doesn't impact frequentist methods.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the statistical foundations for lensing detection, showing key differences between Bayesian and frequentist frameworks regarding selection effects and event numbers.

Abstract: Like light, gravitational waves are gravitationally lensed by intervening
massive astrophysical objects, such as galaxies, clusters, black holes, and
stars, resulting in a variety of potentially observable gravitational-wave
lensing signatures. Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on
strong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple "images": repeated
copies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival
time, and overall "Morse phase." The literature identifies two separate
approaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on
frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection
effects and identified challenges similar to the well-known "birthday problem",
namely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing
catalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different
approaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong
lensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the
number of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are
insensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm
Lo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an
overall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the
posterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing
detection.

### [26] [Disentangling two spectral components in the X-ray emission of the blazar 1ES 0229+200](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15465)
*Alicja Wierzcholska,Hubert Siejkowski*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study presents an analysis of X-ray and optical observations of blazar 1ES 0229+200 using Swift and NuSTAR data, revealing a previously unobserved spectral upturn at ~25 keV during a low X-ray state in 2021. This feature challenges existing emission models and hints at possible synchrotron-Inverse Compton transitions or photohadronic processes linked to neutrino production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the broadband emission mechanisms in blazars, particularly exploring how 1ES 0229+200's exceptionally hard VHE gamma-ray spectrum connects with X-ray properties, and to understand the origin of its spectral features.

Method: Long-term (2008–2024) spectral and temporal analysis of Swift X-ray/optical data combined with NuSTAR hard X-ray observations. Key focus on August 2021 NuSTAR data showing a concave spectrum with a 25 keV upturn, contrasting prior observations without such features.

Result: Discovery of a spectral upturn at ~25 keV during a low X-ray state not seen in prior NuSTAR/Swift-BAT data. This suggests a possible transition between emission components or contributions from photohadronic processes. Supports potential third SED bump in keV-MeV range and neutrino production associations.

Conclusion: The spectral upturn indicates unresolved complexities in blazar emission models, possibly pointing to synchrotron-IC transitions or hadronic activity. This object's behavior strengthens arguments for multi-messenger astrophysics links between high-energy neutrinos and blazars.

Abstract: X-ray observations are essential to achieve a deeper understanding of the
broadband emission mechanism in blazars. Here, we present a long-term spectral
and temporal analysis of X-ray and optical observations of 1E 0229+200
collected with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2008 to 2024,
complemented by hard X-ray observations from the Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array NuSTAR. The blazar 1ES 0229+200 is a high-frequency, peaked BL
Lac object, known for its exceptionally hard very high-energy (VHE)
$\gamma$-ray spectrum extending up to 10 TeV. In August 2021, NuSTAR observed
the source in a low X-ray state, revealing a concave spectral shape with a
distinct upturn around 25 keV. This feature contrasts with previous
observations performed with NuSTAR and Swift-BAT, which showed no such spectral
upturn. Previous observations of 1ES 0229+200 and broadband SED (spectral
energy distribution) modelling suggest that its X-ray emission extends beyond
100 keV without a significant cutoff. The newly detected spectral upturn may
indicate a transition between the synchrotron and inverse Compton components or
could be linked to photohadronic processes involving high-energy neutrinos. We
discuss the implications of this finding in the context of blazar spectral
energy distributions, particularly the potential existence of a third SED bump
in the kiloelectronvolt to megaelectronvolt range. The observed spectral
features support the hypothesis that 1ES 0229+200 could be a source of
high-energy neutrino emission.

*Ludwig M. Böss,Ildar Khabibullin,Daniel Karner,Klaus Dolag,Ulrich P. Steinwandel,Elena Hernandez-Martinez,Jenny G. Sorce*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper uses a cosmological MHD simulation with a spectral CR model to estimate diffuse γ-ray emission from galaxy clusters and cosmic web filaments in the local Universe. The simulation shows CR protons accelerated at shocks contribute to γ-ray emission, but current Fermi-LAT sensitivity is insufficient for detection; improved sensitivity to 1e-11 γ/s/cm² is needed for Coma cluster detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain intergalactic magnetic fields and dark matter interaction models by estimating detectable diffuse γ-ray emission from CR protons interacting in the ICM/IGM.

Method: First cosmological MHD simulation with on-the-fly CR spectral modeling: tracks CR injection at shocks, adiabatic changes, advection; calculates γ-ray emissivity from CR energy density/spectra using local Universe-constrained initial conditions for Fermi-LAT comparison.

Result: CR protons accelerate at shocks in clusters and filaments, producing diffuse γ-rays. Simulated emission is ~3 orders of magnitude below Fermi-LAT upper limits; detecting Coma requires ~1e-11 γ/s/cm² sensitivity.

Conclusion: Current observations miss the predicted emission, but future instruments with higher sensitivity could detect these signals to test cosmic ray models and cosmological magnetic fields/dark matter interactions.

Abstract: Context: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from cosmic ray (CR) protons
scattering off the gas in the intracluster and intergalactic medium (ICM and
IGM) remains out of reach for current observations. Detecting this emission
would provide constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields as well as dark
matter interaction models. Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic
web in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first
cosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR
injection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR
protons, and obtain their $\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated
CR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions,
which evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing
direct comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR
proton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy
clusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below
the current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT. Under the assumption of our model,
a sensitivity of $F_\gamma < 10^{-11} \: \gamma~ \text{s}^{-1}~\text{cm}^{-2}$
is required for a detection of diffuse emission in Coma.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the oldest but fastest pulsars known to date.
To explain how these pulsars could be formed, a new hypothesis was formulated:
the recycling of pulsars, i.e the fact that a pulsar could accrete matter from
a companion and been spun up. In this paper, we developed a population
synthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check
whether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion
mechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to
obtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys.
Toward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body
(SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve
each pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a
force-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and
spatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence
companion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission
locations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model,
respectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio
and $\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that
there should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT
catalogue of $\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle
$\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it
also seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis
and magnetic axis (i.e., $\chi \leq 10${\deg}). We find that only a small
fraction, approximately $\sim 7.5\times10^{-3}$ %, of oxygen-neon white dwarfs
(ONeWDs) in binary systems appear to contribute to the population of mildly
recycled pulsars through accretion-induced collapse.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational-wave events using location data, host-galaxy info, and other factors, successfully applied to GW170817.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of associating electromagnetic candidates with gravitational-wave alerts due to large sky areas, distance uncertainties, and numerous unrelated transients necessitates a robust method.

Method: The method combines 3D gravitational-wave skymaps, host-galaxy data, morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar velocity corrections in a Bayesian framework.

Result: When applied to GW170817, the method correctly ranks AT2017gfo as the top candidate and identifies NGC 4993 as the host galaxy.

Conclusion: This approach improves follow-up efficiency and counterpart identification reliability for current and future gravitational-wave observations.

Abstract: The robust association of electromagnetic candidates discovered during
follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts is challenging, not only due to the
large sky areas and broad distance uncertainties, but also due to the tens to
hundreds of unrelated optical transients that are observed per event. We
present a Bayesian ranking method to identify electromagnetic counterparts to
GW events using only location information. The framework combines
three-dimensional gravitational wave skymaps with host-galaxy information, a
morphology-aware host association, empirical offset priors, and peculiar
velocity corrections. We apply the method to GW170817 where it ranks AT2017gfo
as the top candidate and correctly selects NGC\,4993 as the host. The approach
is directly applicable to transient candidates with only location information
and enables more efficient follow-up with prioritized candidates and leads to
more reliable counterpart identification in current and future observing runs.

Method: Used HST imaging to locate the X-ray position, combined with VLT/MUSE spectroscopic确认 of a galaxy group. Analyzed galaxy properties (faintness, color, structure) and tidal tail association.

Result: GRB localized to a galaxy group at z=0.453 with 96% probability against chance alignment. The GRB's host galaxy lies in a ~180 kpc tidal tail from the group's central galaxy. Star formation triggered by mergers 700 Myr ago likely formed the progenitor binary.

Conclusion: Short GRB progenitors can form in tidally disrupted environments via merger-induced starbursts, linking neutron star mergers to galaxy interactions and r-process element dispersal.

Abstract: We report the precise X-ray localization of GRB~230906A, a short duration
($T_{90}\sim$0.9 s) burst with no optical or radio counterpart. Deep imaging
with the Hubble Space Telescope detects a faint galaxy (G$^\ast$;
$F160W\simeq26$ AB mag) coincident with the sub-arcsecond X-ray position.
Compared with standard GRB galaxies, its faintness, compact size and color
would suggest a high redshift ($z\gtrsim$3) host. However, our observations
also reveal the presence of a galaxy group at $z\!\sim$0.453, confirmed
spectroscopically with VLT/MUSE, with clear signs of interactions and mergers
among group members. The GRB and its putative host project onto an extended
($\approx$180 kpc) tidal tail emerging from the group's central galaxy. The
probability of a chance alignment is small ($P_{cc}\!\lesssim\!4$\%), we thus
argue that the GRB and its galaxy G$^*$ reside within the group. Their peculiar
location along the tidal debris suggests that an enhanced burst of star
formation, induced by the galaxy merger, might have formed the progenitor
compact binary $\lesssim$700 Myr ago. The compact binary later evolved in a
neutron star merger which produced GRB 230906A and injected $r$-process
material into the surrounding circumgalactic medium.

### [31] [Absence of Majorana-Weyl fermions in $d=4$ and the theory of Majorana fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14998)

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: It is customary to identify $\psi_{+}=\nu_{R} + C\overline{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ with
a Majorana fermion on the basis of chirality changing charge conjugation
$\tilde{C}: \nu_{R}\rightarrow C\overline{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ and parity $\tilde{P}:
\nu_{R}\rightarrow i\gamma^{0}\nu_{R}$. The theorem on the absence of a
Majorana-Weyl fermion in $d=4$ states $\tilde{C}\gamma_{5}\tilde{C}^{-1}=
-\gamma_{5}$ with $\tilde{C}=C\gamma_{4}^{T}$, and thus the charge conjugation
of the equivalent Majorana $\psi_{+}=(\frac{1+\gamma_{5}}{2})\nu_{R} +
(\frac{1-\gamma_{5}}{2})C\overline{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ vanishes without auxiliary
$\gamma_{5}\rightarrow - \gamma_{5}$.
  To be consistent with the theorem, it is common to use a doublet
representation of chirality preserving charge conjugation
$\hat{C}:\nu_{R,L}\rightarrow C\overline{\nu_{L,R}}^{T}$ and parity $\hat{P}:
\nu_{R,L}\rightarrow i\gamma^{0}\nu_{L,R}$ in theory containing both
$\nu_{R,L}$. In the type I seesaw model, the latter formulation is applicable
but $\psi_{+}=\nu_{R} + C\overline{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ is not a Majorana fermion. An
analogue of the Bogoliubov transformation converts $\psi_{\pm}=\nu_{R, L} \pm
C\overline{\nu_{R, L}}^{T}$, which are obtained by a precise diagonalization of
the seesaw model, to Majorana fermions $\psi_{M_{1,2}}=(\psi \pm
C\overline{\psi}^{T})/\sqrt{2}$ with a Dirac-type fermion $\psi$, as originally
defined by Majorana. A chiral projection $[(1+\gamma_{5})/2] \psi_{M_{1}}$ of a
Majorana fermion is not a chiral fermion.

### [32] [Adiabatic hydrodynamization and quasinormal modes of nonthermal attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15016)
*Matisse De Lescluze,Michal P. Heller,Aleksas Mazeliauskas,Bruno Scheihing-Hitschfeld,Clemens Werthmann*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how nonthermal attractors emerge in far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, using an exactly solvable Boltzmann equation model for gluon plasmas. It links the decay of excited states during adiabatic hydrodynamization to the quasinormal modes of the attractor, suggesting a framework for discovering new phenomena in nonequilibrium systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the approach to nonthermal attractors in quantum systems and provide an analytical framework for studying hydrodynamization processes, particularly in expanding gluon plasmas. This aids in connecting microscopic dynamics to macroscopic emergent behaviors observed in experiments.

Method: Analyzes an exactly solvable case of the Boltzmann equation for longitudinally expanding overoccupied gluon plasmas under small-angle elastic collisions. Maps the eigenmodes of adiabatic hydrodynamization to the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor using perturbative techniques.

Result: Demonstrates an equivalence between excited state decay eigenmodes and attractor quasinormal modes, derives analytic prescaling solutions for strongly expanding systems, and proposes a general tool for studying nonequilibrium phenomena.

Conclusion: The connection between adiabatic hydrodynamization eigenmodes and nonthermal attractor quasinormal modes provides a theoretical foundation for predicting dynamical signatures of out-of-equilibrium systems, potentially extending to other physical contexts.

Abstract: Nonthermal attractors characterize the emergent self-similar evolution of
far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, from nuclear collisions to cold-atom
experiments. Within the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework, the approach to
the nonthermal attractor can be understood as the decay of excited states of an
effective Hamiltonian. We use an exactly solvable case of the Boltzmann
equation -- the longitudinally expanding overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by
small-angle elastic collisions -- to map the eigenmodes in adiabatic
hydrodynamization to the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor.
If generalized, this equivalence may be used as a discovery tool for new
phenomena in out-of-equilibrium systems. A byproduct of our analysis is the
analytic prescaling solutions for systems undergoing strong longitudinal
expansion.

### [33] [Radiative Correction from Secret Neutrino Interactions and Implications for Neutrino-Scattering Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15023)
*Saeid Foroughi-Abari,Kevin J. Kelly,Yue Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the radiative corrections caused by neutrinophilic mediators with masses below the electroweak scale, which induce observable deviations in neutrino-matter scattering processes (CEvNS, νDIS, neutrino-electron scattering), Z-boson decay widths, and long-baseline oscillation experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate an underappreciated aspect of neutrinophilic mediators—radiative corrections in neutrino interactions—supplementing traditional searches for direct production or tree-level neutrino self-interactions.

Method: The authors analyze scattering processes (CEvNS, νDIS, Borexino data) and Z-boson decays to quantify loop-level effects from a light neutrinophilic mediator, calculating expected deviations and cross-section modifications.

Result: Observable signatures of such mediators exist in multiple experiments even with mediator masses below the electroweak scale; cross-section shifts and altered Z-decay widths provide potential detection channels.

Conclusion: Radiative corrections from neutrinophilic mediators offer complementary probes beyond standard direct search methods, arguing for a cohesive experimental strategy integrating diverse observations to constrain or discover these particles.

Abstract: New, neutrinophilic mediators are one potential extension beyond the Standard
Model of particle physics. Often, studies of neutrinophilic mediator consist of
searching for direct evidence of its production and/or its tree-level virtual
effect for generating strong neutrino self-interaction. In this work, we focus
instead on the fact that such new mediators \textit{also} lead to deviations in
neutrino-matter scattering via radiative corrections. With a mediator mass well
below the electroweak scale, these effects are potentially observable in a
variety of contexts, including coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
(CEvNS), neutrino deeply-inelastic scattering ($\nu$DIS), and neutrino-electron
scattering (e.g., at Borexino). Additionally, such effects lead to new
contributions to the $Z$-boson decay width and to non-standard neutrino
interactions relevant for long-baseline oscillation experiments. We explore all
of these scenarios in some depth, building on the rich phenomenology associated
with neutrinophilic mediators.

### [34] [Atomic Quantum Sensors for High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Searches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15031)
*Yi-fu Cai,Luca Visinelli,Sheng-Feng Yan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework using Gertsenshtein effect and quantum sensors to detect high-frequency gravitational waves (above MHz) inaccessible to existing methods, with potential sensitivities as low as 1e-37 Hz^{-1/2}, enabling tests of early universe phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untested MHz+ gravitational wave regime and probe cosmological scenarios like primordial black holes or phase transitions, impossible with current pulsar timing or ground-interferometer technologies.

Method: Gravitons convert to photons in strong magnetic fields (Gertsenshtein effect), signals amplified via cavity resonance, and detected by atomic quantum sensors (Raman, Rydberg, photoionization channels). Sensitivity calculated through photon flux and shot-noise analysis.

Result: Projected shot-noise-limited sensitivities range from 1e-22 to 1e-37 Hz^{-1/2}, potentially surpassing Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints for stochastic backgrounds. Burst detection remains possible.

Conclusion: This approach opens new avenues in gravitational physics, demands advancements in high-Q cavities and quantum sensors, and could validate or refute exotic early-universe models.

Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves represent an unexplored frontier of
gravitational physics. While pulsar timing arrays reach nHz frequencies and
ground-based interferometers probe the audio band, the regime above the MHz
scale remains essentially untested. We propose a hybrid detection framework in
which gravitons convert to photons via the Gertsenshtein effect in strong
magnetic fields; the resulting electromagnetic signal is resonantly enhanced in
a cavity and read out by atomic quantum sensors. Our approach combines multiple
channels, including long-coherence Raman interferometry in alkali atoms,
microwave Rydberg transitions, photoionization-based detection, and inner-shell
electronic resonances. We derive the graviton-photon conversion probability,
compute the induced photon flux, and estimate the shot-noise-limited spectral
strain noise density. Depending on configuration, the projected
shot-noise-limited sensitivity ranges from $\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim
10^{-22}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in conservative microwave implementations to
$\sqrt{S_{h, {\rm min}}} \sim 10^{-37}{\rm\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in aggressive optical
Raman schemes, potentially surpassing the cosmological bound from Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis for stochastic backgrounds, while coherent bursts remain
unconstrained and detectable. Such reach allows to test scenarios involving
primordial black holes, topological defects, violent phase transitions, and
(p)reheating, motivating advances in high-$Q$ cavities, strong-field magnets,
and quantum-limited atomic sensors, with broad impact across quantum metrology
and fundamental physics.

<details>

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We analyze radiative corrections to the Starobinsky model of inflation
arising from self-interactions of the inflaton, and from its Yukawa couplings,
$y$, to matter fermions, and dimensionful trilinear couplings, $\kappa$, to
scalar fields, which could be responsible for reheating the Universe after
inflation. The inflaton self-interactions are found to be of higher order in
the Hubble expansion rate during inflation, and hence unimportant for CMB
observations. In contrast, matter couplings to the Starobinsky inflaton can
have significant effects on the spectral index of scalar CMB perturbations,
$n_s$, and on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Using a renormalization-group
improved analysis of the effective inflationary potential, we find that the
Planck measurement of $n_s$ constrains the inflaton coupling to light fermions
in the Einstein frame: $y < 4.5 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper
limit on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH} < 2 \times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$,
whereas the ACT DR6 measurement of $n_s$ corresponds to $3.8 \times 10^{-4} < y
< 5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{11} ~{\rm GeV} < T_{\rm RH} < 2.8
\times 10^{11}~{\rm GeV}$, while the upper limits on $r$ provide weaker
constraints. Planck data also imply a constraint on a trilinear inflaton
coupling to light scalars in the Einstein frame: $\kappa \leq 4 \times
10^{12}~{\rm GeV}$, corresponding to $T_{\rm RH} \leq 4.2 \times 10^{13}~{\rm
GeV}$. We further present constraints on inflaton couplings to massive fermions
and scalars, and analyze constraints on couplings in the Jordan frame.

### [36] [Enhancing di-jet resonance searches via a final-state radiation jet tagging algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15151)
*Bing-Xuan Liu,Yu-Xuan Shen,Yuan-Shun-Zi Sui*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that using an event-level deep neural network to tag FSR jets improves di-jet resonance search sensitivity by 10-20% by enhancing signal mass resolution without significantly affecting background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve di-jet resonance search sensitivity at the LHC/HL-LHC by addressing limitations in traditional methods that struggle with distinguishing signal FSR jets from background.

Method: Develop an event-level DNN using the 4-momenta of the top three jets to identify the hardest FSR jet in signals. Correct the invariant mass with the tagged FSR jet to enhance mass resolution. Carefully craft input variables to minimize background mass sculpting.

Result: The method achieves 10-20% improved search sensitivity, significantly enhances signal mass resolution, and maintains minimal background interference across broad mass ranges.

Conclusion: FSR jet tagging via DNN is a promising technique to boost di-jet resonance searches, applicable to current and future LHC/HL-LHC physics programs.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the possibility of enhancing the di-jet
resonance searches by tagging the final state radiation (FSR) jet, using an
event-level deep neural network. It is found that solely relying on the
4-momenta of the leading three jets allows the algorithm to achieve good
discriminating power that can identify the hardest FSR jet in signal, while
rejecting other soft jets. Once the invariant mass is corrected with the tagged
FSR jet, the mass resolution of the signal is greatly enhanced, and the
sensitivity of the search is also improved by 10-20%. By crafting the input
variables carefully, the algorithm introduces minimal mass sculpting for the
background, and its applicability extends to a broad mass range. This work
proves that FSR jet tagging can potentially enhance the di-jet resonance
searches, suiting various stages of the physics programmes at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores P and CP symmetries in charm particle decays by analyzing asymmetry parameters in $\Xi_c^{+}$ decay, using polarized electron/positron beams and helicity formalism to derive angular distributions and assess sensitivity under different experimental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance symmetry studies in particle physics, particularly investigating potential violations of P and CP symmetries in the charm system through precise measurements of decay asymmetries.

Method: Utilized helicity formalism to derive complete angular distributions for $\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ decays, incorporated beam polarization effects, and evaluated asymmetry parameter sensitivity across varying data sizes and beam polarization scenarios.

Result: Developed a theoretical framework quantifying how asymmetry parameters depend on experimental factors, which guides future experiments at the STCF to enhance symmetry violation detection in charm sector analyses.

Conclusion: The methodology provides essential tools for optimizing experimental design in upcoming STCF studies, strengthening prospects for discovering new physics through charm particle symmetry investigations.

Abstract: Symmetry studies represent one of the most promising frontiers in particle
physics research. This investigation focuses on exploring $P$ and $CP$
symmetries in the charm system through the measurement of asymmetry decay
parameters in the three-body decay of $\Xi_c^{+}$. Incorporating electron and
positron beam polarization effects and utilizing the helicity formalism, we
characterize the decay of $\Xi_c^{+}$ and its secondary hyperons through
asymmetry decay parameters. The complete angular distribution formula for these
decays has been systematically derived. Our study evaluates the sensitivity of
the asymmetry parameters for the $\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ decay
channel under various data sample sizes and beam polarization scenarios. These
findings establish a robust theoretical framework for future experimental
studies at the STCF, providing valuable insights for symmetry investigations in
the charm sector.

### [38] [The detection of cosmic neutrino background with helicity-changing decays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15377)
*Jihong Huang,Shun Zhou*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the decays of a heavy neutrino into a lighter neutrino and a Nambu-Goldstone boson, calculating decay rates with specified helicities. It then models the impact of these decays on cosmological neutrino number densities and their effects on neutrino capture rates in experiments like PTOLEMY, finding significant modifications in event rates, especially for Dirac neutrinos with helicity changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how heavy neutrino decays affect cosmological neutrino evolution and experimental detection rates, addressing gaps in previous studies that may have overlooked helicity-dependent effects and their cosmological implications.

Method: Calculated total decay rates considering specific helicities of parent and daughter neutrinos. Simulated the evolution of cosmological neutrino number densities during universe expansion. Analyzed modifications to capture rates in PTOLEMY-like experiments by comparing scenarios with and without neutrino decays.

Result: Decay-induced changes to neutrino number densities lead to significant modifications in experimental event rates. Helicity-changing decays are particularly influential for Dirac neutrinos, altering capture probabilities compared to stable neutrino scenarios.

Conclusion: Neutrino decays must be considered in cosmological models and experimental planning, as helicity-dependent effects can profoundly impact observable quantities like event rates. This has implications for PTOLEMY and similar experiments aiming to detect relic neutrinos.

Abstract: In this talk, we present the investigation of the invisible decays of a heavy
massive neutrino into a lighter neutrino and a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson,
i.e., $\nu_i^{} \to \nu_j^{} + \phi$. The total decay rates are calculated in
the most general case, where the individual helicities of both parent and
daughter neutrinos are specified. We then examine the evolution of the number
densities of cosmological relic neutrinos throughout the expansion of the
Universe, and explore the consequent impacts on the capture rates in
PTOLEMY-like experiments. The total event rates can be significantly modified
compared to those in the scenario of stable neutrinos, with helicity-changing
decays playing an especially important role in the Dirac neutrino case.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present the first quantitative demonstration of the statistical
convergence of heavy-flavor parton distribution functions at small x across
modern NNLO global fits. Using the latest NNPDF4.0, CT18, and MSHT20 sets, we
find a maximal relative deviation of 16.8 percent at x = 1e-6 and Q = 100 GeV,
corresponding to nearly a factor-of-two improvement over the approximately 30
percent spread in pre-2013 determinations. This convergence, stabilized by
consistent alpha_s and scale treatments, marks a transition of the heavy-flavor
sector into a statistically controlled regime of small-x QCD. We further show
that this precision directly reduces PDF-driven uncertainties in heavy-quark
electroproduction at future ep colliders (LHeC and FCC-eh) by about a factor of
two and enhances the theoretical stability of leptophilic new-physics searches
such as a neutral Z_l gauge boson. These findings establish a link between the
precision frontier of QCD and the discovery potential of next-generation
lepton-hadron facilities.

*V. M. Braun,K. G. Chetyrkin,A. N. Manashov*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates the NNLO anomalous dimension matrix for flavor-singlet axial-vector QCD operators using conformal symmetry and applies this to compute form factors for γγ* → η/η' processes at large momentum transfers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision of perturbative QCD predictions for exclusive processes involving pseudoscalar mesons like η and η', necessitating third-order corrections which were previously unknown.

Method: 1. Uses conformal symmetry to derive the three-loop anomalous dimension matrix for spin N ≤8 flavor-singlet axial-vector operators from gauge-invariant two-point functions.
2. Combines with existing two-loop coefficient functions to compute NNLO form factors for γγ* → η/η' reactions.

Result: Obtains NNLO QCD corrections for the γγ* → η' form factor, crucial for precise analysis of rare meson decays and photon-photon collision experiments.

Conclusion: Demonstrates successful application of conformal symmetry methods to reach NNLO accuracy, providing necessary tools for high-precision QCD calculations in exclusive processes.

Abstract: We use conformal symmetry to calculate the NNLO anomalous dimension matrix
(three loops) for flavor-singlet axial-vector QCD operators for spin $N \le 8$
from a set of gauge-invariant two-point correlation functions. Combining this
result with the recent calculation of the two-loop coefficient functions, we
carry out the calculation of the $\gamma\gamma^\ast\to \eta$ and
$\gamma\gamma^\ast\to \eta'$ form factors at large momentum transfers to the
NNLO accuracy in perturbative QCD.

### [41] [Probing Composite Structure and Spin-Orbit Coupling with GPDs in ${}^{4}$He](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15838)
*Antonio Garcia Vallejo,Matthew D. Sievert*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes a connection between the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of spin-0 composite hadrons and their spin-1/2 constituents using Wigner distributions. It introduces a novel spin-orbit coupling term and applies the framework to a ⁴He nucleus, highlighting experimental signatures and potential for AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the GPDs of composite hadrons relate to their constituent partons and to explore new effects like spin-orbit coupling in composite systems not seen in TMDs.

Method: Decomposing composite hadron matrix elements into constituent GPDs weighted by Wigner distributions, exploiting light-front boost invariance, Pauli matrix decomposition, and applying symmetry constraints (rotational, parity, time-reversal invariance) to derive master integrals.

Result: Derived a master integral for quark GPDs in spin-0 composites, identified a new ΔL·ΔS spin-orbit coupling term causing GPD mixing, and demonstrated applicability to ⁴He with phenomenological models.

Conclusion: Framework enables studies of composite hadron GPDs and GTMDs, provides tools for analyzing light nucleus data, and offers a foundation for AI-assisted applications in particle physics.

Abstract: In this work, we derive a relation between the generalized parton
distributions (GPDs) of a spin-0 composite hadron and the GPDs of its
spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ constituents. The method decomposes matrix elements of the
composite parent into matrix elements of its constituents, weighted by the
Wigner distributions of the constituents inside the composite parent.
Exploiting the boost invariance of the light-front Wigner distributions, we
derive the dictionary between rest-frame and boosted-frame kinematics and use
it to perform a Pauli matrix decomposition of the spin degree of freedom. The
constraints of unbroken rotational, parity, and time-reversal invariance lead
to a master integral for the quark GPDs of the spin-0 composite target. We also
identify a novel $\Delta\vec{L}\cdot\vec{S}$ form of spin-orbit coupling
responsible for GPD mixing in composite hadrons which is absent in the case of
transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of composite hadrons.
We then apply the framework to a composite ${}^{4}$He target with simple
phenomenological models to identify possible experimental signatures of
composite-structure effects in light nuclei. The framework we have constructed
here can be readily extended to the case of generalized TMDs (GTMDs), while the
phenomenological framework is applicable both to analyses of light nucleus data
and as training input for AI-assisted applications.

### [42] [Diabatic Dynamical Diquark Model of Hidden-Strangeness Tetraquarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15844)
*Shahriyar Jafarzade,Richard F. Lebed*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study extends a dynamical diquark model from adiabatic to diabatic form to analyze hidden-strangeness tetraquarks, finding no strong di-hadron threshold dominance unlike in the charm sector. States like φ(2170), f₂(2340), and η(2370) remain viable tetraquark candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effect of di-hadron thresholds on hidden-strangeness tetraquark states beyond the adiabatic approximation, aiming to better understand their structure compared to known charm sector exotic states.

Method: Generalized the dynamical diquark model to diabatic form, tabulated di-hadron thresholds, and computed di-hadron content for each state.

Result: No hidden-strange tetraquark candidates are strongly associated with di-hadron thresholds. States above 2 GeV (φ(2170), f₂(2340), η(2370)) show peculiar decays consistent with tetraquark interpretation.

Conclusion: Diabatic effects are less significant in hidden-strangeness sector than charm sector. High-mass states with unusual decay properties remain prime candidates for exotic tetraquark structures.

Abstract: We generalize our recent analysis of hidden-strangeness tetraquarks within
the dynamical diquark model from its adiabatic form (in which each state is
described solely by a diquark-antidiquark potential) to its diabatic form
(which incorporates effects of di-hadron thresholds upon the states). We
tabulate all relevant thresholds and compute the di-hadron content of each
predicted state. Our results produce no particular hidden-strange tetraquark
candidate whose structure is dominated by di-hadron structure, in contrast to
the charm sector, where many exotic states are strongly associated with such
thresholds. Multiple states above 2~GeV with peculiar decay properties,
including $\phi(2170)$, $f_2(2340)$, and $\eta(2370)$, continue to serve as
excellent hidden-strange tetraquark candidates.
