Many astrophysical models and beyond\nthe Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these\nobservations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark\nmatter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the\nJWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress\nstructure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on\nthe UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model\ndesigned to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits\non DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter\nspace. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section $\\propto v^{-2}$ velocity\ndependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of $\\sim$ 1 -- 500 MeV.\nFor other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section $\\propto\nv^{0},\\,v^{-4}$, and DM-electron scattering cross-section $\\propto\nv^{0},\\,v^{-2},\\,v^{-4}$), our limits are competitive with those obtained from\nother cosmological observables.

Here we perform such an analysis\nfor a dark sector with an Abelian Higgs model in the conformal limit, which is\nknown to admit large supercooling. We compare simple analytic parametrisations\nof the bounce action, one-loop finite temperature calculations including Daisy\nresummation, and results of a dimensionally reduced (3D) effective theory\nincluding up to two-loop corrections using the DRalgo framework. Consistent\nrenormalisation group evolution (RGE) of the couplings is essential for a\nmeaningful interpretation of the results. We find that the 3D EFT with\nconsistent expansion in the 4D parameters gives a significantly reduced scale\ndependence of the phase transition parameters.

We first\nperformed multi-frequency, long-length (500 refractive length scale)\nsimulations of multipath propagation in the IISM to study the properties of\nscattering variations under a variety of scattering conditions. The results of\nour simulations show the possibility of significant radio-frequency\ndecorrelation in the scattering variations, particularly for the anisotropic\nscattering medium. Our analysis of the observed DM and scattering variations\nusing the MPTA 4.5-year data set shows that there can be apparent\nanticorrelations between DM and scattering variations, which we attribute to\nthe model fitting methods. We also report a possibility that plasma\nunderdensities might exist along the sight lines of PSR J1431$-$5740 and PSR\nJ1802$-$2124. Finally, using simulations, we show that the IISM noise models\ncan result in the apparent measurement of strong frequency dependence of\nscattering variations observed in the MPTA data set. Our analysis shows that\nimprovements in the IISM noise modelling techniques are necessary to accurately\nmeasure the IISM properties."}

The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\\lesssim$10 keV reflects\nthat of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than\nthat of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line.\nWhile this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk\nintrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When\nusing a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted\nspin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow\nbinary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and\nradiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\\approx0.8$--0.9, which underlines the\nstrong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements."}

However, residual aberrations, especially\nnon-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel,\nlimit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as\nspectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those\nissues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular\nseparations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously\ndemonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI),\nwhich offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent\nstarlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted\nfrom the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI\nmethod on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging\nalmost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve\nwith ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images,\napplying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars\nsurrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD\n163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle\nfield, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames\nand reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Lo\\`eve\nimage projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the\nartifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms\n(e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising\nstrategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in\nfuture direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require\nfrequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first\norder."}

X-ray observations years to decades after the\nexplosions offer a way to gain insight into this, as hard X-ray emission from\nthe central regions will emerge as the ejecta absorption decreases. Here we\nanalyze and place upper limits on late-time X-ray emission in 242 nearby SNe,\nusing 607 observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR. We use\nabsorption models based on 3D simulations of neutrino-driven explosions to\naccount for absorption of emission from the compact objects by the asymmetric\nejecta. We detect X-ray emission from 12 SNe, including four for the first time\n(SN 1982R, SN 1984J, SN 1992bu, and SN 2003gk), and several of the others at\nlater epochs than before. The X-ray spectra of these SNe are consistent with\ninteraction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), with the possible exception of\nSN 1979C, which shows an additional hard component, as also noted in previous\nstudies at earlier epochs. This emission may be due to a pulsar wind nebula.\nUsing the upper limits in the full sample, we also perform a population\nsynthesis to constrain the fraction of SNe that produce pulsars and the\nproperties of the pulsars themselves. We find that pulsar populations with mean\ninitial spin periods $\\gtrsim100\\rm~ ms$ are favored. Finally, we note that the\nhigh luminosities of several of the SNe with CSM interaction imply interactions\nwith dense shells."}

The conventional analyses solely based on\nthe power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying\nsource population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution.\nHowever, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian\nin nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the\nhigh redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this\nwork, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data\nfrom the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of\nthe fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral\ncorrelation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from\nthe current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the\nrange 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates\nto the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between\n$2.4\\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\\times10^{2} \\rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\\rm z} = 1 $\n) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20\n~M_{\\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the\nPBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH\nformation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering.

Such an\naccretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located\nabove a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and\nFeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona,\ncan be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity\nof the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying\nthe SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor.\nOur results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code\nTITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the\nray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray\nspectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the\ndisk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation\nand external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized\niron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the\nblack hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV.\nFor all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron\nlines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the\nilluminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona\ncovering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under\nstrong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those\noriginating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total\nline profile in AGN."}

Under review for Proceedings of International\n  Summer Conference 2025: Intelligent Systems & Decision Making: Human Insights\n  in the Era of A.I - Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer Nature", "summary": "Complex inference tasks, such as those encountered in Pulsar Timing Array\n(PTA) data analysis, rely on Bayesian frameworks. The high-dimensional\nparameter space and the strong interdependencies among astrophysical, pulsar\nnoise, and nuisance parameters introduce significant challenges for efficient\nlearning and robust inference. These challenges are emblematic of broader\nissues in decision science, where model over-parameterization and prior\nsensitivity can compromise both computational tractability and the reliability\nof the results. We address these issues in the framework of hierarchical\nBayesian modeling by introducing a reparameterization strategy. Our approach\nemploys Normalizing Flows (NFs) to decorrelate the parameters governing\nhierarchical priors from those of astrophysical interest. The use of NF-based\nmappings provides both the flexibility to realize the reparametrization and the\ntractability to preserve proper probability densities. We further adopt\ni-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to accelerate exploration of complex\nposteriors. This unified use of NFs improves statistical robustness and\ncomputational efficiency, providing a principled methodology for addressing\nhierarchical Bayesian inference in PTA analysis."}
