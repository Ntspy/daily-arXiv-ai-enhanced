### [1] [Probing gluon saturation with forward di-hadron correlations in proton-nucleus collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21466)
*Paul Caucal,Zhong-Bo Kang,Piotr Korcyl,Farid Salazar,Björn Schenke,Tomasz Stebel,Raju Venugopalan,Wenbin Zhao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a numerical study of semi-inclusive forward di-hadron production in proton-nucleus collisions using the Color Glass Condensate framework. It incorporates non-linear rapidity evolution, Sudakov resummation, and gluon distribution models, comparing results with STAR data and exploring uncertainties. Predictions are made for the ALICE FoCal upgrade.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate high-energy proton-nucleus collisions, particularly azimuthal correlations in di-hadron production, and validate the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework through comparison with experimental data while addressing theoretical uncertainties.

Method: Uses the Color Glass Condensate theory with the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation (non-linear rapidity evolution with running coupling), Sudakov resummation (both perturbative/non-perturbative), and phenomenological gluon distribution models. Analyzes STAR Collaboration data and evaluates uncertainties from saturation scales and hadronization processes.

Result: Demonstrates agreement with STAR's proton-proton and proton-gold collision data, quantifies theoretical uncertainties from saturation scales and hadronization effects, and provides predictions for ALICE FoCal's future measurements.

Conclusion: The framework effectively describes di-hadron azimuthal correlations in high-energy collisions, highlights the importance of including non-linear gluon dynamics and Sudakov effects, and underscores the necessity of ALICE FoCal data for further theory validation.

Abstract: We present a detailed numerical investigation of semi-inclusive forward di-hadron production in proton-nucleus collisions employing the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. We focus on the regime where di-hadrons are produced nearly back-to-back in the transverse plane, thereby justifying a transverse-momentum-dependent factorization approach in terms of small-$x$ gluon distributions. Our computation integrates several key elements: i) non-linear rapidity evolution via the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with running coupling, ii) both perturbative and non-perturbative Sudakov resummation, and iii) a phenomenologically constrained model for the initial conditions for small-$x$ gluon distributions. We compare this phenomenological framework to experimental data from the STAR Collaboration on azimuthal correlations in forward di-pion production in both proton-proton and proton-gold collisions. We analyze the systematic theoretical uncertainties associated with the saturation scales of nuclei at the initial scale for rapidity evolution and with those associated with the hadronization process. Finally, we make predictions for the kinematics anticipated to be covered by the ALICE Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) upgrade at the Large Hadron Collider.

### [2] [Probing Internal Conversion and Dark-Matter-Induced De-excitation of 180mTa with a gamma-ray TES Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21468)
*A. Gando,K. Ichimura,K. Ishidoshiro,T. Kikuchi,T. Kishimoto,A. Takeuchi,R. Sato,R. Smith*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method using γ-ray TES arrays to detect the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta, surpassing conventional HPGe detector limitations in sensitivity. It demonstrates potential for discovery of internal conversion processes and dark matter interactions within feasible timelines, extending beyond current experimental constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional HPGe detectors by leveraging TES arrays' superior calorimetric and coincidence tagging capabilities to precisely measure energy deposits and identify de-excitation events, which are critical for studying rare phenomena like internal conversion and dark matter interactions with nuclei.

Method: The method involves using a γ-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array to detect the total energy deposited during the de-excitation of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta via internal conversion or dark matter interactions. Key features include near-complete containment of low-energy secondary particles (electrons, X-rays, and recoils) for accurate energy summing, and delayed coincidence tagging via subsequent electron-capture decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. Two benchmark scenarios (strongly interacting DM and inelastic DM) are evaluated for DM-induced de-excitation sensitivity.

Result: Simulations show that with 256 or 1,000 TES pixels, the setup can reach the expected internal conversion half-life in 2.6 or 0.66 years, respectively. A 10,000-pixel array with a five-year exposure surpasses previous HPGe-based constraints on dark matter-induced de-excitation and explores uncharted parameter space for new physics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that TES arrays offer significant improvements in sensitivity and discovery potential for ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta de-excitation studies, especially in probing dark matter interactions, outperforming conventional detectors and necessitating the deployment of larger-scale TES systems for future experiments.

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $γ$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3σ$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$~yr and $0.66$~yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.

Abstract: The higgsino-like neutralino is a compelling dark matter candidate motivated by both cosmology and naturalness considerations. While a pure higgsino typically requires a mass of around $1.1~\mathrm{TeV}$ to satisfy the observed thermal relic abundance, the presence of light sleptons can significantly alter this requirement. In this work, we revisit higgsino dark matter within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), focusing on scenarios with slepton coannihilation. We find that efficient coannihilation allows the higgsino mass to be as light as $\sim 400~\mathrm{GeV}$ while satisfying relic density constraints. We explicitly contrast the impact of recent direct detection updates: the LZ-2022 limits raise this lower bound to approximately $450~\mathrm{GeV}$, while the stringent LZ-2024 constraints further shift the viable mass floor to $\sim 500~\mathrm{GeV}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the direct detection sensitivity is strongly dependent on the relative signs of the gaugino mass parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$. We find that scenarios with $M_1, M_2 > 0$ are fully excluded by LZ-2024. Conversely, configurations with opposite signs ($M_1/M_2 < 0$) remain broadly viable, as destructive interference in the neutralino-Higgs coupling efficiently suppresses the spin-independent cross section. Finally, we delineate the remaining viable parameter space for both the opposite-sign cases and the specific configurations with negative $M_1$ and $M_2$.

### [4] [The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with Non-Invertible Selection Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21509)
*Yuichiro Nakai,Hajime Otsuka,Yoshihiro Shigekami,Zhihao Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework within the MSSM where quark and lepton flavor structures, along with the suppression of FCNCs, are regulated by non-invertible selection rules derived from gauging the outer automorphism Z2 of a discrete Z_N symmetry. This approach yields realistic Yukawa textures aligned with experimental observations, while ensuring stable soft SUSY breaking masses and maintaining flavor-violating effects within experimental bounds through RG evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the long-standing challenges of explaining the hierarchical quark/lepton mass matrices and suppress FCNC processes in SUSY models without ad-hoc assumptions. Existing solutions often require complicated flavor symmetries or impose unnatural constraints. This work seeks a simpler, more robust mechanism using non-invertible selection rules.

Method: The authors construct a MSSM model with non-group-like fusion rules from gauged Z2 outer automorphism of Z_N. They derive Yukawa textures under these rules, calculate soft SUSY breaking terms, analyze FCNC processes (e.g., μ→eγ, meson mixings), and perform renormalization group equations (RGE) analysis to test parameter stability. Random O(1) coefficients are applied to explore parameter space robustness.

Result: All flavor-violating parameters (mass insertion coefficients) stay within experimental bounds even with random coefficients. Yukawa textures correctly reproduce observed mass hierarchies and mixing angles. Soft terms remain diagonal and stable under RG evolution up to the GUT scale. FCNC suppression is naturally achieved without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Non-invertible selection rules offer a novel and viable solution for flavor structure and FCNC problems in supersymmetric models. This framework provides a predictive and robust alternative to traditional SUSY flavor models, potentially guiding future collider searches and precision flavor experiments.

Abstract: We investigate a framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in which the quark and lepton flavor structure and suppression of flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) are governed by non-invertible selection rules. By implementing such non-group-like fusion rules for matter fields, arising from gauging the outer automorphism $\mathbb{Z}_2$ of a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, we obtain realistic Yukawa textures that reproduce the observed quark and lepton masses and mixings while ensuring diagonal soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking masses and hence suppressing dangerous FCNC processes. We analyze mass insertion parameters under random $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients and find that all flavor-violating effects are consistent with experimental limits on processes such as $μ\to e γ$ and meson mixings. We show that the Yukawa textures and soft terms remain stable under renormalization group evolution. Our results demonstrate that non-invertible selection rules provide a compelling new mechanism to address both the flavor structure and FCNC problems in supersymmetric models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a model explaining the strong isospin violations observed in X(3872) decays. The X is assumed to be a compact isosinglet tetraquark and its charged partners to form an isotriplet, together with an additional neutral state mixing with the isosinglet. The isotriplet results from the loose binding of open charm mesons and, in isolation, has strongly suppressed production rates. However, its neutral component can still mix with the isosinglet and induce the large isospin violations observed. The compact-isosinglet/molecular-isotriplet pattern appears reversed when the Z(3900) resonances are considered. The Z particles observed correspond to a compact isotriplet and there is no evidence of a neutral isosinglet Z. We show that no isospin violation in the Z decays is expected.

### [6] [Deep-learning jet flavor tagging for precision hadronic Higgs measurements at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21558)
*Xinzhu Wang,Yifan Zhu,Chunxiang Zhu,Jianfeng Jiang,Manqi Ruan,Kun Wang,Haijun Yang,Yongfeng Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study demonstrates the improved precision in measuring Higgs boson decays into light quarks and gluons using advanced deep learning algorithms at a future electron-positron collider (CEPC), particularly enhancing sensitivity for H→cc and H→gg modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe the Yukawa couplings and test the flavor structure of the Standard Model through precise measurements of Higgs decays into quarks and gluons.

Method: Analyzed the process e⁺e⁻→ZH at 240 GeV using CEPC design, focusing on Z→νν̄ and Higgs decays into bb̄, cc̄, ss̄, and gg. Used ParticleNet and transformer-based taggers with XGBoost classifiers to distinguish Higgs decay modes from backgrounds.

Result: Achieved relative precision of 0.18% (bb̄), 1.07% (cc̄), 0.52% (gg), and 78% (ss̄). Improved precision for cc̄ (42%) and gg (26%) compared to prior CEPC results. Estimated 1.3σ significance for H→ss̄.

Conclusion: Deep learning-enhanced jet flavor tagging significantly boosts precision in Higgs decay studies at future colliders, offering critical insights into Standard Model tests.

Abstract: Precise measurements of Higgs decays into quarks and gluons are essential for probing the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson and testing the flavor structure of the Standard Model. We investigate the process $e^+e^- \to ZH$ at $\sqrt{s}=240~\mathrm{GeV}$ at a future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory, taking the CEPC design as a benchmark. The analysis focuses on events with $Z\toν\barν$ and hadronic Higgs decays $H\to b\bar b$, $c\bar c$, $s\bar s$ and $gg$. Jet flavor is identified using state-of-the-art particle-level deep neural network taggers (ParticleNet, Particle Transformer and More-Interaction Particle Transformer), whose per-jet outputs are combined with global event observables in a two-stage analysis employing XGBoost classifiers to separate the four Higgs decay modes from the dominant two- and four-fermion Standard Model backgrounds. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $20\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$, we obtain projected relative precision on $σ(ZH)\times\mathrm{Br}(H\to X)$ of 0.18% for $X=b\bar b$, 1.07% for $c\bar c$, 0.52% for $gg$ and 78% for $s\bar s$. Compared with the CEPC published results, the precisions for $H\to c\bar c$ and $H\to gg$ are improved by about $42%$ and $26%$, respectively. For $H\to s\bar s$ we present a quantitative sensitivity estimation corresponding to a statistical significance of about $1.3σ$. These results highlight the potential of deep-learning-based jet flavor tagging for precision studies of Higgs decays at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories.

### [7] [Dipole-dipole scattering: summing large Pomeron loops in non-linear evolution with leading twist kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21592)
*Eugene Levin*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the QCD-based BK equation's analytic solution aligns with Pomeron calculus 'fan' diagrams, calculates large Pomeron loop contributions to dipole scattering, and confirms KNO gluon distributions yielding entropy matching Kharzeev-Levin predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the connection between QCD equations for dipole density and Pomeron calculus solutions, validate the role of large Pomeron loops, and confirm theoretical predictions about gluon distributions and entropy in high-energy scattering.

Method: Compare the analytic solution of the BK equation with the leading twist kernel to the 'fan' diagrams using $t$ channel unitarity. Apply Abramovsky-Gribov-Kancheli cutting rules to derive gluon distribution and entropy calculations.

Result: The analytic BK solution matches Pomeron 'fan' diagrams, large Pomeron loops contribute significantly to dipole scattering, and gluon distributions follow KNO law, leading to entropy S_E consistent with Kharzeev-Levin predictions.

Conclusion: The findings validate the interplay between QCD and Pomeron calculus frameworks, confirm the applicability of KNO scaling, and support the theoretical entropy model in high-energy physics contexts.

Abstract: It is shown in this paper that the QCD equations for dipole density have the natural solution: the 'fan' diagrams of the Pomeron calculus. We found the dipole densities comparing the analytic solution to the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation for the simplified leading twist kernel with the $t$ channel unitarity. Using these densities we calculate the contributions of large Pomeron loops to dipole-dipole scattering at high energies. Applying the Abramovsky,Gribov and Kancheli cutting rules we found that the produced gluons are distributed accordingly the KNO (Koba, Nielsen and Olesen) law which leads to the entropy $S_E = \ln(x G(x,Q^2))$ in an agreement with Kharzeev - Levin predictions.

### [8] [Kaon T-even transverse-momentum-dependent distributions and form factors in a self-consistent light-front quark model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21642)
*Yongwoo Choi,Ahmad Jafar Arifi,Ho-Meoyng Choi,Chueng-Ryong Ji*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a self-consistent light-front quark model (BT-based LFQM) for the kaon, addressing four-momentum conservation and zero-mode ambiguities. It successfully models electromagnetic and scalar form factors, TMDs, PDFs, and demonstrates consistency with QCD evolution, offering a unified framework for meson structure analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified model of meson structure that enforces four-momentum conservation and resolves ambiguities in light-front quantization via the BT construction, enabling accurate calculations of form factors and TMDs without component-dependent results.

Method: Uses a BT-based LFQM with invariant mass M0 applied uniformly, Gaussian light-front wave functions, and explicit computation of all current components. Evaluates electromagnetic form factors, scalar definitions, TMDs with twist analysis, and PDF evolution using pQCD.

Result: Current-component-independent results for $F_{K^+}(Q^2)$ confirmed; distinction between scalar form factors $f_S$ and $F_S$ under BT-LFQM; TMDs show Gaussian $k_\perp$ dependence for twist-2 and flavor-dependent higher twists. Forward-limit sum rule for $f_4^q$ validated. Evolved PDFs align with phenomenological scales.

Conclusion: BT-based LFQM provides a consistent framework linking nonperturbative light-front dynamics to collinear PDFs, offering reliable meson structure description and bridging scales from low (nonperturbative) to high (QCD evolution) energy regimes.

Abstract: We present a self-consistent light-front quark model (LFQM) for the kaon based on the Bakamjian--Thomas (BT) construction and apply it to the electromagnetic and scalar form factors, as well as the full set of unpolarized T-even transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) and their collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). A uniform use of the invariant mass $M_0$ in both hadronic matrix elements and Lorentz prefactors enforces four-momentum conservation at the meson--quark vertex and yields current-component--independent observables, removing light-front zero-mode ambiguities. Properly normalized electromagnetic form factor $F_{K^+}(Q^2)$ is exemplified as a current-component--independent observable by verifying its uniqueness with the explicit computation from all the available components ($γ^+$, $γ^\perp$, and $γ^-$) of the current. In the scalar channel, we compare the direct $f_S(Q^2)$ and mass-factored $F_S(Q^2)$ definitions and show they are not interchangeable within the BT-based LFQM because $M\to M_0(x,{\bf k}_\perp)$ must be implemented inside the integral. Using a Gaussian form for the light-front wave function, the twist-2 TMD $f_1^q$ becomes exactly Gaussian in ${\bf k}_\perp$, while higher-twist TMDs ($f^{\perp q}$, $e^q$, $f_4^q$) display systematic twist/flavor hierarchies, including an elliptic deformation of $f_4^q$ tied to $γ^-$ component. The BT-based LFQM satisfies the forward-limit sum rule for $f_4^q(x)$. We further analyze the perturbative QCD evolution of the valence PDFs for the pion and kaon and report their Mellin moments at representative scales, enabling direct comparison with phenomenology. Overall, the BT-based LFQM provides a unified, current-independent description of meson structure and a consistent bridge from nonperturbative light-front dynamics to evolved collinear PDFs.

### [9] [Determination of the HERA coherent diffractive $J/ψ$ production cross section via artificial neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21704)
*Taufiq Iqbal Baihaqi,Chalis Setyadi,Zulkaida Akbar,Parada T. P. Hutauruk,Apriadi Salim Adam*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a model-independent approach using an artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze exclusive coherent diffractive $J/ψ$ production data from HERA and LHC. The ANN successfully predicts differential cross-sections and extracts the exponential slope $b$, showing its strong dependence on $Q^2$ and $W$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of previous model-dependent analyses, which were restricted by inherent assumptions and kinematic applicability, the authors seek a more flexible and predictive method for analyzing $J/ψ$ production data.

Method: The authors employ an artificial neural network (ANN) technique in a model-independent framework. They train the ANN on HERA data to predict differential cross-sections across $W$, $Q^2$, and $t$, then extend the model by incorporating LHC data to predict total photoproduction cross-sections and extract the exponential slope $b$.

Result: The ANN model provides reliable cross-section predictions across the dataset. Combining HERA and LHC data reveals that the exponential slope $b$ exhibits a strong dependence on both $Q^2$ and $W$.

Conclusion: The model-independent ANN approach effectively addresses limitations of traditional models, offering improved predictive power. The findings highlight the dynamic role of $Q^2$ and $W$ in determining $b$, suggesting further theoretical and experimental exploration of these dependencies.

Abstract: An exclusive coherent diffractive $J/ψ$ production dataset from HERA, covering a large kinematic range in the photon virtuality $Q^2$, the squared momentum transfer $t$, and the photon-proton center-of-mass energy $W$, has been analyzed using various theoretical models with different approaches. In common model analyses, the inherent assumptions and limited kinematic applicability somewhat restrict the predictive power of the models, resulting in model-dependent prediction results. In this paper, we present our model-independent approach for the same reaction process and dataset, utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The prediction of the best ANN model for the HERA differential cross-section dataset over a range of $W$, $Q^2$, and $t$ is obtained. We then extend the ANN model by combining the HERA and LHC data at various values of $W$ to predict the total photoproduction cross-section and demonstrate how to extract the exponential slope $b$. We find that the exponential slope $b$ strongly depends on $Q^2$ and $W$.

### [10] [On-Shell Renormalization of Dim-8 SMEFT from Complete Amplitude Basis: I. Four-Fermion Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21724)
*Chao Wu,Ming-Lei Xiao,Jiang-Hao Yu,Yu-Hui Zheng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates the complete one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) for all dimension-8 four-fermion operators in the SMEFT using an on-shell framework based on unitarity cuts of bubble integrals. The Young Tensor basis ensures consistency and reduces redundancies, while Mathematica's ABC4EFT package is used to produce the full RGE results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive and non-redundant set of RGEs for dimension-8 four-fermion operators in SMEFT, addressing the complexity arising from their large number and intricate flavor structures.

Method: The authors use an on-shell approach with unitarity cuts of bubble integrals, leveraging the Young Tensor basis to handle flavor structures and systematically reduce integrated cuts to a consistent amplitude basis. Computations were automated with the ABC4EFT Mathematica package.

Result: Full one-loop RGEs for all dimension-8 four-fermion operators in SMEFT are derived, with results provided in a supplementary file via ABC4EFT.

Conclusion: The method establishes a robust framework for systematically deriving RGEs in high-dimensional operator SMEFT, enabling precise theoretical predictions and experimental comparisons in particle physics.

Abstract: We compute the complete one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) for all the four-fermion operators at dimension-8 Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We adopt the on-shell framework, where the RGEs are obtained from the unitarity cuts of the bubble integrals. To construct a consistent set of RGEs without redundancy, we utilize the Young Tensor amplitude/operator basis as the building blocks of the tree-level amplitudes that constitute the unitarity cuts, which incorporates the full flavor structures of the effective operators. Due to the large number of effective operators for a dimension-8 type, it is crucial to reduce the integrated cuts to the same RGE amplitude basis, which is also made possible by the algorithm in the Young Tensor method. With the Mathematica package ABC4EFT that implements the method, we obtain the full result of the dimension-8 four-fermion RGEs with the output file attached as the supplementary material.

### [11] [Absence of CP Violation in the Scalar Sector of a Higgs Triplet Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21735)
*Matheo Escobar,Sebastian Olivares*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores whether a Higgs Triplet Model with a complex singlet scalar can exhibit spontaneous CP violation but concludes that the scalar sector cannot source CP violation under any parameter configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the potential for spontaneous CP violation in an extended Higgs Triplet Model with a complex singlet scalar, as such violations are important for understanding fundamental symmetries in particle physics.

Method: The authors analyze the scalar potential's minimization conditions and the role of global symmetries, particularly focusing on the effect of a non-zero trilinear coupling (κ) and its limit as κ approaches zero. They demonstrate that the scalar potential structure inherently prevents spontaneous CP violation.

Result: The analysis shows that for any non-zero κ, phase alignment due to minimization conditions and global symmetries leads to a real vacuum. When κ approaches zero, enhanced global symmetries make vacuum phases unphysical, thus no CP violation arises in any scenario.

Conclusion: The scalar sector of this model cannot be a source of spontaneous CP violation across its entire parameter space, challenging any prior expectations of CP violation in this specific model configuration.

Abstract: We investigate the potential for spontaneous CP violation in a Higgs Triplet Model extension, including a complex singlet scalar. We demonstrate that the scalar potential strictly forbids spontaneous CP violation across the entire parameter space. For a non-zero trilinear coupling $κ$, minimization conditions combined with global symmetries enforce a phase alignment that yields a real vacuum. In the singular limit $κ\to 0$, we show that the enhancement of global symmetries renders unphysical vacuum phases. Consequently, we conclude that the scalar sector of this model cannot source CP violation.

### [12] [Radiative $H^+_{1,2}W^- Z$ vertices in flavour conserving three Higgs-doublet scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21759)
*Nabarun Chakrabarty,Indrani Chakraborty*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study explores radiatively induced $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices in three Higgs doublet models (3HDMs), comparing results across Type-II, lepton-specific, and democratic models under the alignment limit. It highlights a doubling in form factors compared to 2HDMs and proposes a detectable signature at the LHC via vector boson fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effects of additional charged Higgs interactions in 3HDMs on $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices, leveraging the alignment limit to simplify analysis. The goal is to discern model differences and validate 3HDM predictions against 2HDMs using both theoretical constraints and LHC observables.

Method: Computed one-loop UV-finite, gauge-invariant amplitudes for $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices in selected 3HDM types. Incorporated theoretical constraints and experimental data (e.g., $h \to γγ$, $B \to X_s γ$) to derive form factors. Evaluated LHC prospects for $H_1^+$ production via VBF and its decay to H2/A2.

Result: 3HDM form factors show ~100% increase over 2HDM counterparts. LHC analysis predicts $σ×BR$ ~0.1 fb for $H_1^+ → H_2^+ H_2/A_2$, offering a distinctive signature to probe charged Higgs interactions and confirm multi-Higgs scenarios.

Conclusion: The enhanced form factors and proposed LHC signature provide clear experimental handles to differentiate 3HDMs from 2HDMs. The cascade decay mechanism acts as a 'smoking gun' for 3HDM's two charged Higgs sector, enabling verification through high-luminosity Run 3 data.

Abstract: A detailed calculation of the radiatively induced $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices is carried out in the context of flavour conserving three Higgs doublet models (3HDMs). The Type-II, lepton specific and democratic versions of the 3HDM are chosen as representative cases and the \emph{alignment limit} is adopted. We arrange the amplitudes in UV-finite and gauge-invariant subsets for a sharper understanding of the underlying one-loop structure. Factoring-in various theoretical constraints and the ones from the $h \to γγ$ signal strength and the $B \to X_s γ$ branching ratio, we compute the relevant form factors and compare them among the various 3HDM types taken. The results also indicate a sizeable increment ($\sim 100\%$) over the corresponding form factors in 2HDMs. In addition, we probe the $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices at the 14 TeV LHC using vector boson fusion (VBF). It is seen that production of $H_1^+$ via VBF and the subsequent $H_1^+ \to H_2^+ H_2/A_2$ decays can have $σ\times \text{BR}$ in the $\mathcal{O}$(0.1 fb) ball park. Therefore, such a cascade can shed light on the strength of the $H_1^+ W^- Z$ interaction and confirm the presence of two charged scalars thereby acting as a smoking gun signal of a 3HDM.

### [13] [Direct Deep Neural-network Extraction of Generalized Parton Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21761)
*Dima Watkins,Dustin Keller*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine-learning method using neural networks to extract generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from Compton form factors (CFFs), addressing the inverse problem posed by a singular kernel integral transform. The method incorporates physics constraints and regularization, enabling probabilistic extraction of GPDs from experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the longstanding inverse problem in extracting GPDs from CFFs, which are related through a singular kernel linear integral transform, and to provide a flexible, scalable, and model-independent approach for analyzing DVCS data to uncover hadronic structures.

Method: A neural network with a differentiable QCD principal-value kernel layer is developed. The network enforces GPD properties like oddness in x, endpoint suppression, and uses curvature regularization. It uses Monte Carlo CFF ensembles from global fits to experimental data, generating replica networks for probabilistic GPD extraction.

Result: Successfully demonstrated extraction of Re H for Jefferson Lab data, yielding 3D GPD surfaces. Established a scalable method applicable to current and future DVCS experiments.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust, physics-informed framework for multidimensional GPD reconstruction, enabling precise analysis of hadronic structure from collider data without parametric assumptions.

Abstract: We present a machine-learning method for the nonparametric extraction of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from Compton form factors (CFFs) constrained by experimental data. The method addresses the longstanding inverse problem posed by the principal-value (PV) linear integral transform with a singular kernel that relates the charge-conjugation-even (C-even) quark GPD $H^{(+)}$ to the real part of the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) amplitude. Our approach constructs a differentiable representation of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) PV kernel and embeds it as a fixed, physics-preserving layer inside a neural network that parameterizes the GPD $H^{(+)}(x,ξ,t,Q^{2})$ itself. The model enforces exact oddness in $x$, implements endpoint suppression, and includes curvature-based regularization that stabilizes the inversion in kinematically ill-conditioned regions. A Monte Carlo ensemble of CFFs, obtained from a global neural-network fit to unpolarized DVCS measurements with propagated experimental uncertainties, serves as input to a replica ensemble of GPD networks, yielding a fully probabilistic extraction of $H^{(+)}$ over the phase space. We demonstrate the method using a global determination of $\mathrm{Re}\,\mathcal{H}$ for Jefferson Lab measurements, and present a direct neural-network reconstruction of three-dimensional GPD surfaces $H^{(+)}(x_{0},ξ,t,Q_{0}^{2})$ obtained from experimental CFF inputs. This work establishes a flexible, scalable, and model-independent strategy for extracting multidimensional hadronic structure from current and future DVCS data and other GPD-related processes.

*Xuan-Heng Zhang,Cong-Feng Qiao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses QCD sum rules to calculate the mass spectrum of $Λ_carΣ_c$ and $Λ_barΣ_b$ molecular states, finding their masses around 5.8 GeV, consistent with BESIII's observation of no $Λ_carΣ_c$ bound-state between 4715-4735 MeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the plausible mass region of $Λ_carΣ_c$ bound states not observed in the 4715-4735 MeV range by BESIII, and explore hidden-bottom $Λ_barΣ_b$ candidates.

Method: Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules with two interpolating currents and nonperturbative condensates up to dimension 12 were used to calculate mass spectra for $Λ_carΣ_c$ and $Λ_barΣ_b$ molecular states.

Result: The central masses of $Λ_carΣ_c$ bound states are around 5.8 GeV, consistent with BESIII's findings. $Λ_barΣ_b$ states are proposed as hidden-bottom candidates.

Conclusion: The results provide theoretical predictions for experimental searches of $Λ_carΣ_c$ and $Λ_barΣ_b$ bound states, especially the latter as potential hidden-bottom particles.

Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration indicate that no $Λ_c\barΣ_c$ bound-state with a mass near threshold in the range $4715$--$4735~\mathrm{MeV}$ was observed. In order to determine the plausible mass region of the bound states in this structure, we calculate the mass spectrum of the $Λ_c\barΣ_c$ molecular configuration with the method of QCD sum rules. Two linearly independent interpolating currents are constructed, and contributions from nonperturbative condensates up to dimension 12 are included in the numerical results. Consequently, we obtain the masses of the candidate bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\,0^+,\,1^-,\,1^+$. Our results show that the central values of the $Λ_c\barΣ_c$ bound-state masses lie around the $5.8~\mathrm{GeV}$ region, consistent with the findings reported by the BESIII Collaboration. Furthermore, we compute the mass spectrum of the $Λ_b\barΣ_b$ bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\,0^+,\,1^-,\,1^+$, which could be served as hidden-bottom candidates in the experimental detecting.

### [16] [Neutrino Textures from Modular $A_4$ Left--Right Symmetry: Experimental Signatures at DUNE and T2HK in the Post-JUNO Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22020)
*Bhabana Kumar,Debajyoti Dutta,Mrinal Kumar Das*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores seven two-zero textures in a left-right symmetric model using the A₄ modular group, analyzing neutrino mass matrices, LFV processes, and constraints from DUNE/T2HK/JUNO experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how two-zero textures in neutrino mass matrices can be realized within a left-right symmetric framework using modular symmetry, and to study their observability in upcoming neutrino experiments.

Method: Assign matter fields as A₄ singlets with specific charge assignments and modular weights to obtain neutrino mass textures. Calculated parameters for neutrinoless double beta decay and LFV processes. Simulated constraints from DUNE, T2HK, and JUNO.

Result: Seven two-zero textures achieved. DUNE/T2HK significantly constrain θ23-δ_CP space, especially for B₂/B₄ textures leading to CP-conserving islands. JUNO improves θ12/θ13 precision further narrows allowed regions under inverted mass ordering.

Conclusion: Modular symmetry with A₄ allows concrete realizations of two-zero textures. Combined实验 data from next-gen neutrino experiments will drastically narrow parameter spaces, making textures B₂ and B₄ highly testable predictions.

Abstract: We have realized different two-zero textures within the framework of the left right symmetric model using the $Γ_{3}\cong A_{4}$ modular group. The matter multiplets of the model are assigned as three singlet representations of the $A_{4}$ group, and their charge assignments together with the modular weights of the Yukawa couplings are chosen in such a way that different two-zero textures of the neutrino mass matrix are obtained. In total, we have successfully realized seven different two-zero textures. Furthermore, we have studied neutrinoless double beta decay and lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes, and have calculated the effective Majorana mass and the branching ratios for LFV processes for each of the textures. We further probe these two-zero textures at the long-baseline neutrino experiments DUNE and T2HK. We find that DUNE, especially when combined with T2HK, can significantly restrict the $θ_{23}-δ_{\rm CP}$ parameter space predicted by these textures. Moreover, the inclusion of high-precision determinations of $θ_{12}$ (from JUNO) and $θ_{13}$ leads to a substantial, further reduction of the allowed parameter space. For assumed inverted mass ordering, the synergy of DUNE and T2HK leads to a highly predictive scenario for the $B_{2}$ and $B_{4}$ textures, as the allowed regions collapse into tiny islands near the CP-conserving points in the lower and higher octant of $θ_{23}$, respectively.

### [17] [Fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions of QCD in a magnetic field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22023)
*Patrick Copinger,Minoru Eto,Muneto Nitta,Zebin Qiu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the ground state of low-energy QCD matter in strong magnetic fields, proposing that fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions with baryon number one are the minimal excitations, rather than previously thought bosonic Skyrmions with baryon number two. These fermionic Skyrmions can form separated states without energy cost, attached to opposite sides of chiral solitons. The phase boundary between CSL and Skyrmion phases remains unaffected, and in the chiral limit, the CSL simplifies to a linear neutral pion configuration while Skyrmions arrange periodically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the nature of the minimal Skyrmion excitations in the domain-wall phase of QCD matter under strong magnetic fields, addressing discrepancies in previous assumptions about their baryon numbers and binding energetics.

Method: Theoretical analysis using QCD models under strong magnetic fields, examining the stability and energy configurations of Skyrmions on chiral soliton lattices. Calculations were performed to assess whether domain-wall Skyrmions can dissociate into lower-baryon-number states without energy cost.

Result: Fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions with baryon number one are identified as the minimal stable states, capable of separating into independent fermionic pairs on opposing sides of a chiral soliton without energy penalty. The phase transition boundary remains unchanged, and chiral limit behavior clarifies the structural simplification of CSL and Skyrmion arrangements.

Conclusion: The study corrects prior misconceptions about Skyrmion baryon numbers in magnetic QCD phases, establishing that fermionic Skyrmions are the fundamental excitations. This has implications for understanding quark matter and potential astrophysical applications in magnetic field environments like magnetars.

Abstract: The ground state of low-energy QCD matter in strong magenetic fields is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), a periodic array of neutral pion domain walls (chiral solitons) perpendicular to the magnetic field, or domain-wall Skyrmion phase, in which Skyrmions are induced on top of the CSL. Previously found domain-wall Skyrmions are bosons with the baryon number two. In this paper, we show that the minimum domain-wall Skyrmions are fermions with the baryon number one; a bosonic domain-wall Skyrmion can be separated without cost of energy into two fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions attached on the opposite sides of a chiral soliton. The phase boundary between the CSL and domain-wall Skyrmion phases is unchanged. In the chiral limit, the CSL reduces to a linearly dependent neutral pion on the direction of the magnetic field, while fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions sit in an equal distance of a half period.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the potential for discovering charged Higgs bosons in the 2HDM+a model using the CLIC collider at 1500 GeV, focusing on specific production and decay channels to establish observation and exclusion limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the parameter space of the 2HDM+a model beyond LHC capabilities and set sensitivity benchmarks for charged Higgs discovery at CLIC.

Method: Simulated analysis of charged Higgs pair production via $e^+e^-$ collisions at 1500 GeV, decaying into $H^+→aW$ and $H^−→tb$, searching for $4j+2b+E_T^{miss}$ signatures. Signal significance evaluated for $m_{H^	ext{±}}$ up to 650 GeV.

Result: 5σ discovery reach for 400–600 GeV Higgs masses in certain parameter regions. 2σ exclusion limits mapped across $m_{H^	ext{±}}−m_a$ planes up to 650 GeV.

Conclusion: CLIC offers enhanced discovery potential for 2HDM+a charged Higgs bosons compared to LHC, providing critical constraints on model parameters in unexplored mass ranges.

Abstract: In this work, we study the search for charged Higgs bosons in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model plus an additional pseudo-scalar (2HDM+a) at the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). Focusing on the pair production of charged Higgs bosons, followed by the decays $H^\pm \to a W $ and $ H^\mp \to t b $, we analyze the signal channel of $4j+2b+E_T^{miss}$. Given the center-of-mass energy of CLIC as $ \sqrt{s} = 1500$ GeV, charged Higgs bosons with masses $ m_{H^\pm} < \sqrt{s}/2$ are explored. Simulation results indicate that the signal significance of 400 GeV and 600 GeV charged Higgs bosons can reach $5σ$ in specific parameter spaces, and the $2σ$ exclusion limits in the $m_{H^\pm}- m_a$ plane are presented for $m_{H^\pm}$ in the range of [400, 650] GeV.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the fully charm tetraquark states, particularly incorporating contributions from internal gluon radiations. The paper first presents analytical expressions for the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to the decay amplitudes of fully charm tetraquarks into two photons. It is found that the QCD corrections are significant for the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ fully charm tetraquark decay process, whereas they are relatively small for the $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ fully charm tetraquark decay process. Subsequently, by considering photon-photon fusion in ultra-peripheral high-energy collisions of protons and nuclei and in electron-positron collision processes, we provide theoretical predictions for the production cross sections of fully-charm tetraquark states. The results presented in this work regarding the electromagnetic production and decay of fully charm tetraquarks shall be tested in current and future experiments.

*T. Gent,S. Huber,K. Mimasu,J. M. No*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores baryogenesis in a non-minimal Higgs sector with two doublets and a singlet pseudoscalar, identifying a viable parameter space that avoids electric dipole moment constraints. Improved computations show suppressed baryon asymmetry, requiring larger scalar mixing for testable collider signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how a non-minimal Higgs sector (2HDM+a) can achieve baryogenesis with transient CP violation, bypassing stringent electric dipole moment constraints from beyond-the-Standard-Model physics.

Method: Detailed computation of baryon asymmetry in the 2HDM+a model, incorporating thermal history requirements and updated parameters to address limitations in prior studies.

Result: The model predicts a suppressed baryon asymmetry compared to previous estimates, necessitating stronger singlet-2HDM pseudoscalar mixing for successful baryogenesis, enhancing testability via LHC and low-energy flavor measurements.

Conclusion: The model offers a testable framework through upcoming collider and flavor experiments, emphasizing the importance of scalar mixing in achieving measurable baryogenesis signals.

Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of the viable baryogenesis parameter space of a non-minimal Higgs sector consisting of two Higgs doublets and a singlet pseudoscalar (2HDM$+a$). In such a model, an early Universe period of transient CP violation may occur, driven by a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the CP-odd scalar $a$. This naturally avoids the stringent electric dipole moment experimental constraints on beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of CP violation. We provide a state-of-art computation of the baryon asymmetry, providing several important improvements over existing baryogenesis computations for this model. We show that the required thermal history and successful baryogenesis lead to a predictive scenario, testable in the near future by a combination of LHC searches and low-energy flavour measurements. Our improved predictions for the baryon asymmetry find that it is rather suppressed compared to earlier predictions, requiring larger mixing between the singlet and 2HDM pseudoscalars and hence leading to a more easily testable model at colliders.

*Andrei Angelescu,Andreas Bally,Florian Goertz,Sascha Weber*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores gauge-Higgs grand unification models in AdS5, addressing unresolved Standard Model issues and predicting TeV-scale resonances. It uses Planck-brane correlators to evolve gauge couplings consistently, showing grand unification is feasible with moderate brane terms in a SU(6) model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the lightness of the Higgs boson, fermion mass hierarchies, and provide a unified origin of gauge symmetries and their breaking, while predicting testable LHC signatures through TeV-scale bosons.

Method: Employing Planck-brane correlators to evolve gauge couplings from electroweak to Planck scales in 5D AdS5 models, incorporating bulk fields and brane masses, focusing on SU(6) Georgi-Glashow-like unification.

Result: Demonstrates viable grand unification in SU(6) models with moderate brane kinetic terms, improving upon prior methods by including brane masses and gauge-Higgs VEV in a unified framework.

Conclusion: Gauge-Higgs grand unification in warped geometries is a promising approach, offering solutions to Standard Model puzzles and LHC-testable predictions, with successful unification achievable under specified conditions.

Abstract: We present a concise survey of the running of gauge couplings in realistic models of gauge-Higgs grand unification in a slice of AdS$_5$ space and investigate their potential unification. Besides unifying the gauge groups of the Standard Model, these models can address various unresolved puzzles, such as the lightness of the Higgs boson and the strong hierarchies within fermion masses and mixings, as well as provide a common origin of the gauge symmetries and the sector that spontaneously breaks them. At the same time, they furnish interesting LHC signatures in the form of TeV-scale resonances of the $X,Y$-like bosons, providing a trace of the grand-unified group, accessible at low energies. Using the method of Planck-brane correlators allows us to evolve the couplings consistently from the electroweak scale up to the Planck scale, avoiding shortcomings of other frequently-used approaches and including the effects of bulk scalars, fermions, and gauge-bosons within a common framework. We thereby revisit, contrast, and supplement results in the literature, the latter for example by including brane masses and the gauge-Higgs vacuum expectation value. Moreover, in a phenomenology section, we apply our results to the concrete case of Georgi-Glashow-like unification with a SU(6) $\supset$ SU(5) symmetry in the 5D bulk, presenting a quantitative survey of the quality of unification. We find that grand unification is possible in such models in the presence of moderately large brane kinetic terms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate interactions of exotic states with the Standard Model through an asymmetric portal involving gluons and leptons, accessing particles with specific SU(3)/SU(2) quantum numbers not easily probed otherwise.

Method: Construct all dimension 6 effective operators for lepton-gluon portal interactions, analyze additional dimension 7 operators, and simulate single-production modes at colliders.

Result: Identifies viable exotic state quantum numbers accessible via this portal and predicts observable collider signatures for their detection.

Conclusion: Lepton-gluon portals provide a promising avenue for discovering exotic particles at colliders, with specific experimental strategies recommended based on operator analysis.

Abstract: We explore models where single new exotic states interact with the Standard Model through an asymmetric Standard Model portal with couplings to at least one gluon and one lepton. We consider the complete set of effective operators up to dimension 6, and examine a few additional dimension 7 operators that contain interesting field content or potential collider signals. The lepton-gluon portal allows access to exotic states with an interesting range of SU(3) and SU(2) quantum numbers. Finally, we explore potential single-production modes and their phenomenological signatures at colliders.

*Rebecca Szabó,Valentin D. Ivanov,M. Švanda*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study examines if exoplanets around active M-stars can host life despite high UV/X-ray activity, proposing the Wide Field Survey telescope to expand research on hundred of stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of exoplanets in habitable zones, especially around M-stars with high activity, demands understanding if their intense radiation affects habitability.

Method: Conducting a large-scale analysis of flaring exoplanet-hosting M-stars' activity levels and their impact on potential habitability, utilizing the Wide Field Survey telescope for extensive observations.

Result: Aims to determine if M-star activity precludes habitability, leveraging upcoming data from Gaia and PLATO missions.

Conclusion: The study will provide critical insights into habitability around active stars, guiding future targeted observations and missions.

Abstract: As of late 2025 there are about 70 exoplanets that meet the formal criterion of having equilibrium temperatures allowing the presence of liquid water and about 50 of them orbit M-stars, known for their strong chromospheric activity. Most of these stars are close to the Sun and the planet-to-star mass and luminosity ratios are advantageous, allowing for a more detailed follow-up than of planets orbiting hotter and more massive stars. Many more planets orbiting late-type stars are expected to be discovered by Gaia and PLATO in the following years. However, the lingering question remains whether the UV and X-ray emission, associated with the stellar activity, allows for complex life. A comprehensive study focused on properties of flaring exoplanet hosts and their activity, on a much larger scale than these few tens (soon to become hundreds) of stars with habitable planets is called for, to answer the question if such stars can harbor habitable planets. The proposed Wide Field Survey telescope is well suited for this study.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper outlines a strategy to maximize the detection of electromagnetic counterparts to LISA's massive black hole binary (MBHB) mergers by coordinating observations with space-based and ground-based telescopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LISA will observe MBHB mergers in the millihertz range, which can be identified weeks before coalescence, offering opportunities for coordinated electromagnetic observations. However, efficiently localizing these events and securing observations is challenging.

Method: The authors propose a combination of optimizing LISA's data analysis pipeline for early detection, leveraging multi-messenger astronomy collaborations, and prioritizing observations with complementary telescopes (e.g., James Webb Space Telescope, next-gen ground-based telescopes) based on MBHB parameters like mass, redshift, and sky location.

Result: The strategy could increase the number of detected EM counterparts by improving event localization accuracy, timely telescope follow-up, and target selection criteria for both space and ground-based instruments.

Conclusion: Successful execution of this multi-faceted approach will provide unprecedented insights into MBHB astrophysics and enable synergies between gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations, paving the way for a new era in multi-messenger astronomy.

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), adopted by ESA and scheduled for the second half of the next decade, will drive a new revolution in the rapidly growing field of gravitational-wave astronomy, by extending GW observations into the hiterto unexplored millihertz regime. One of the key source classes of LISA is merging massive black hole binaries in the 1e4-1e7 Msun mass range detectable to very high redshifts $z\sim 15$. MBHBs lighter than 1e6 Msun can potentially be identified during their inspiral weeks before coalescence, allowing for complementary electromagnetic observations before, during, and after the two MBHs merge. This white paper aims at defining the optimal strategy to maximize the number of detected EM counterparts of LISA MBHB events.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel DCL-xLSTM network to efficiently detect lensed gravitational waves in space-based detectors, achieving high accuracy across varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space-based GW detectors will observe lensed events, but traditional methods are computationally intensive. Wave-optics effects in the millihertz band require new efficient screening tools.

Method: Proposes Dual-Channel Lensing feature extraction eXtended Long Short-Term Memory Network (DCL-xLSTM) with matrix-valued memory and mixing mechanisms to capture amplitude diffraction patterns. Trained using Point Mass and Singular Isothermal Sphere models spanning wave-to-geometric optics transitions.

Result: Achieved AUC >0.99 with TPR >98% at FPR <1%. Robust to SNR changes, lens types, and masses.

Conclusion: DCL-xLSTM is a viable high-efficiency tool for future space-based GW detection, enabling scalable analysis of lensed events for cosmological studies.

Abstract: The space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe lensed GW events, offering new opportunities for cosmology and fundamental physics. In the millihertz frequency band, the GW wavelength is often comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of the lens, where wave-optics effects are significant. Although traditional matched filtering is effective, the intense computational resources required motivate the search for more efficient alternatives to accelerate candidate event screening. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a Dual-Channel Lensing feature extraction eXtended Long Short-Term Memory Network (DCL-xLSTM). Unlike conventional recurrent architectures, DCL-xLSTM employs a matrix-valued memory structure and a memory-mixing mechanism to effectively capture amplitude diffraction patterns that span the entire millihertz frequency band. Trained on data generated by Point Mass (PM) and Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) models accounting for the transition from wave-optics to geometric-optics, the proposed method achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.99, maintaining a true positive rate (TPR) above 98% at a false positive rate (FPR) below 1%. The network is robust against variations in signal-to-noise ratio, lens type, and lens mass, establishing its viability as a high-efficiency tool for future space-based GW detection.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that neural networks can efficiently simulate cosmic ray radio pulses, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional Monte-Carlo methods while maintaining accuracy in $X_₂ reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of simulating radio emissions from cosmic ray showers, which limits data analysis despite advancements in signal modeling and microscopic simulations.

Method: A neural network is trained to simulate radio pulses, serving as a proof of concept for using simple neural networks to model emergent deterministic macroscopic phenomena from microscopic simulations. The network is applied to $X_₂ reconstruction.

Result: The neural network achieves comparable resolution to full Monte-Carlo simulations for radio emission analysis, significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Neural networks provide a viable, efficient method for cosmic ray radio pulse simulation, potentially revolutionizing large-scale data analysis in particle physics by balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Cosmic ray shower detection using large radio arrays has gained significant traction in recent years. With massive improvements in signal modelling and microscopic simulations, the analysis of incoming events is still severely limited by the simulation cost of radio emission to interpret the data. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used for simulating such radio pulses. This work serves as a proof of concept that simple neural networks can be used for emergent deterministic macroscopic phenomena of microscopic simulations. We also demonstrate how such a neural network can be used for the physics use case of $X_\mathrm{max}$ reconstruction, while retaining comparable resolution to using full Monte-Carlo simulations for radio emission.

### [27] [WST spectroscopic variability alerts: discovery space, data flow system requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21949)
*Valenitn D. Ivanov*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of the Wide-Sky Tracker (WST) to issue alerts based on spectroscopic variations, expanding beyond traditional imaging surveys. It outlines new research avenues in studying variable objects like emission line stars and active galaxies, and discusses the necessary data processing and reference systems for effective alerts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage WST's multiplexity for spectroscopic variability alerts, which current surveys cannot do, enabling new discoveries in variable celestial objects.

Method: Reviews existing imaging-based alert systems, proposes WST's DFS requirements (rapid processing, spectral reference databases), and evaluates two options for reference spectrum comparison (self-archive vs user-submitted).

Result: Spectroscopic alerts could revolutionize monitoring variable objects. Method for alert ranking via spectral modeling shows promise. Critical requirements identified include data speed and reference databases.

Conclusion: Implementing a spectroscopic alert system using WST's capabilities creates unprecedented discovery opportunities, but demands precise technical execution and integration with existing spectral data resources.

Abstract: The enormous multiplexity of the WST opens up the possibility to trigger alerts for variable objects - an option that has been reserved so far only for imaging surveys. WST can go further by detecting spectroscopic line profile and line strength variations. I review previous alert-issuing surveys that are limited to imaging, and describe some of the new research possibilities that this feature of the data flow system (DFS) would open up. The latter range from variability of emission line stars, such as Bes, WRs and LBVs to variability of active galaxies and quasars, including the so-called changing look objects that shift between Type 1 and Type 2. Furthermore, I describe the requirements that the WST DFS must meet to make this feasible. The most critical aspect is the rapid data processing for timely follow-up. Next, the alert system is tightly connected with the data reduction and archive, because it will need an extensive and continuously updated spectral reference database. The new spectra will have to be compared against these reference spectra to identify variations. The reference spectra can either be "native" from the WST itself or they can originate from other spectroscopic surveys. Two options for the DFS are considered: one is to conduct an automated search of the WST's own archive, and potentially of other spectroscopic archives and a second option is to allow the users to submit reference spectra on their own. The spectroscopic alert system will open up a completely new discovery space that is not accessible to the existing or planned near-future surveys. Finally, I discuss the advantages of moving the variability detection to physical parameters by modeling the observed and reference spectra and comparing the derived fitting parameters. This strategy offers a robust method for alert ranking.

TL;DR: The paper investigates horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) for two-level atoms freely falling into a Bardeen regular black hole, showing that the radiation spectrum is Planckian with temperature linked to the Bardeen Hawking temperature. The excitation probability is suppressed near the extremal limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building on prior work by Scully, Camblong et al., the study explores how the regular structure of a Bardeen black hole (which lacks a singularity) affects acceleration radiation and quantum vacuum effects near the horizon.

Method: The authors use geodesic expansions and near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) reduction to model scalar fields. They analyze the Klein-Gordon equation under an inverse-square potential with coupling determined by Bardeen's surface gravity, calculating excitation probabilities for atoms passing through a Boulware vacuum with a stretched-horizon mirror.

Result: The spectrum is Planckian with temperature tied to Bardeen Hawking temperature. The Bardeen parameter influences radiation strength, showing suppression when approaching the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results demonstrate dependence on both the Bardeen parameter and atomic transition frequency.

Conclusion: The study confirms that regular black holes maintain key quantum optical effects similar to standard black holes, with unique modifications from their non-singular core. It supports the validity of CQM approaches in analyzing quantum phenomena near regular black hole horizons.

Abstract: Motivated by the work of Scully \textit{et al.} [ \textcolor{blue}{Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 115, 8131 (2018)}] and Camblong \textit{et al.}[ \textcolor{blue}{Phys. Rev. D 102, 085010 (2020)}], we investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) for freely falling two-level atoms in the geometry of a Bardeen regular black hole. Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature. We analyze how the regular core parameter controls the strength of the radiation and demonstrate that the excitation probability is strongly suppressed as the geometry approaches the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of the spectrum on the Bardeen parameter and on the atomic transition frequency.

### [29] [GraviBERT: Transformer-based inference for gravitational-wave time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21390)
*Martin Benedikt,Ippocratis D. Saltas*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: GraviBERT is a novel deep learning framework combining convolutional and transformer architectures to improve gravitational-wave parameter estimation via pretraining and fine-tuning, achieving up to 45% error reduction and 15x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in gravitational-wave parameter estimation by developing a model that captures universal patterns, accelerates training convergence, and improves accuracy, especially under low signal-to-noise ratios and across varied detector noise profiles.

Method: GraviBERT uses an Inception-based multi-scale convolutional network with a transformer encoder and regression head. It employs BERT-style pretraining (masking feature segments) to learn universal patterns, followed by supervised fine-tuning. The model works directly on noisy waveforms and adapts to downstream tasks through the regression head.

Result: Reduces mean absolute error by up to 45%, accelerates training 15x, achieves sub-10% mass/distance errors at low SNR, and maintains high R² scores (over 0.9) for mass parameters at SNR 10. Effective for domain adaptation to new detector noise and waveform models.

Conclusion: GraviBERT establishes a foundation for next-generation models in gravitational-wave astronomy by demonstrating transfer learning efficacy, detector-agnostic representations, and efficiency gains, paving the way for multi-task applications in noisy real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce GraviBERT, a novel deep learning framework for inference of gravitational-wave time series, which relies on an Inception-inspired multi-scale convolutional feature extractor combined with a transformer encoder and a suitable regression head. GraviBERT is trained in two stages: a BERT-style pretraining phase, in which the model learns to predict masked segments in feature space to capture universal patterns and physics, followed by supervised fine-tuning for accurate parameter estimation. This approach demonstrates impressive improvement across multiple metrics compared to training from scratch. On in-domain data, it reduces the mean absolute error for point-estimate parameter inference by up to $30\%$, and training convergence accelerates by up to a factor of six. Moreover, at low signal-to-noise ratio, the mean relative precision of the inferred masses and distances reaches the few-percent level, while the mean absolute error in the effective spin is about $10^{-3}$. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model demonstrates remarkable efficiency, converging up to $15\times$ faster on small target datasets and reducing estimation errors by up to approximately $45\%$, indicating that it learns sufficient detector-agnostic representations. Cross-approximant transfer demonstrates comparable performance, achieving up to $44\%$ reductions in mean absolute error across all parameters and up to $15\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding 0.9 for mass parameters at signal-to-noise ratio 10, compared to 0.74 - 0.87 when training from scratch. Notably, GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms. The final regression head of the model can be adapted for a range of downstream tasks after pretraining, positioning it as a step towards foundation-style models in gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy.

*Slava G. Turyshev*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper outlines a comprehensive framework for modern fundamental physics, aiming to both reproduce established models like the Standard Model and address unresolved issues such as dark matter and quantum gravity. It reviews current theoretical approaches and experimental efforts, emphasizing observables' energy scales, limitations, and required sensitivities, concluding with a roadmap based on decision points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically address shortcomings of the Standard Model, General Relativity, and ΛCDM, including dark matter, neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and conceptual challenges like quantum gravity and the cosmological constant problem, while ensuring predictive unification.

Method: The review structures the current baseline theories (SM, GR, ΛCDM), details anomalies and their parameters, surveys theoretical directions (EFTs, amplitude programs, lattice methods, symmetry-based models, cosmological EFTs, quantum information approaches), and evaluates experimental landscapes across platforms and messengers.

Result: Identifies key decision points and cross-checks for future research, provides a staged roadmap prioritized by scientific questions rather than project-specific goals, and highlights critical observables, statistical/systematic limitations, and required experimental sensitivity thresholds.

Conclusion: Fundamental physics must integrate theoretical rigor with targeted experiments, focusing on interdependent probes at various scales to resolve inconsistencies and unify theories. The roadmap emphasizes adaptive decision-making over fixed projects to maximize discovery potential.

Abstract: Fundamental physics today is best defined operationally: it is the program of identifying the microscopic degrees of freedom, symmetries, and dynamical laws that (i) reproduce the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, General Relativity (GR), and the $Λ$CDM cosmological model in their regimes of validity, and (ii) explain the observed phenomena that these baseline theories do not account for (dark matter, neutrino masses, baryogenesis, dark energy), while resolving conceptual inconsistencies (quantum gravity, naturalness, the cosmological constant problem, the measurement problem in quantum theory, information in black holes) and providing predictive unification. This review first lays out the SM+GR+$Λ$CDM baseline, the best current evidence for its parameters, and the concrete anomalies and missing ingredients. It then surveys the most relevant theoretical directions (effective field theories; amplitude/positivity programs; lattice and many-body methods; symmetry-based model building; cosmological EFTs; quantum information approaches to QFT/gravitation) and the experimental/observational landscape, including ground and space platforms, astronomical messengers, and in-situ tests. Throughout we emphasize: (a) how each observable maps to energy scales and couplings; (b) the dominant statistical and systematic limitations; (c) the sensitivity required for decisive progress. A staged roadmap is given only after the technical review, organized by decision points and cross-checks rather than by specific projects.

### [31] [Is energy conserved in general relativity ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21471)
*Sinya Aoki*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A report marking IJMPA and MPLA's 40th anniversary discusses energy conservation in curved spacetime, concluding matter energy isn't conserved due to no time symmetry and gravitational energy inclusion fails due to Noether's 2nd theorem, yet conserved matter-related quantities exist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore energy conservation principles in curved spacetime contexts like general relativity, addressing longstanding debates about energy conservation and gravitational field's role in such systems.

Method: Analyzes Noether's theorems, examines spacetime symmetries (or lack thereof), assesses attempts to include gravitational energy in conservation laws, referencing prior research[1-8] for theoretical frameworks.

Result: Matter energy non-conservation in curved spacetime is confirmed; gravitational energy inclusion approach invalid per Noether's 2nd theorem; conserved quantities tied to matter fields still exist despite these limitations.

Conclusion: While total energy conservation remains elusive in general relativity due to spacetime curvature, specific conserved quantities linked to matter fields persist, offering partial resolution to energy conservation challenges.

Abstract: This short report is dedicated to the 40th anniversary of International Journal of Modern Physics A (IJMPA) and Modern Physics Letters A (MPLA). While the report is based on a series of papers[1-8], its content reflects my personal viewpoints. Therefore I am solely responsible for all the statements in the report. In this report we discuss conservation of energies in a curved spacetime including general relativity. We argue that the matter energy is not necessarily conserved in a curved space time due to a lack of time translational invariance, and adding energy of gravitational fields to recover the conservation law of energies fails due to Noether's 2nd theorem. We show that there exists conserved quantities associated with the matter

### [32] [Functional Determinants for Constrained Path Integrals in Minisuperspace Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21549)
*Hiroki Matsui*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper evaluates constrained minisuperspace path integrals in JT gravity and Bianchi IX quantum cosmology using the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem, deriving exact functional determinants. It shows that integrating out certain variables enforces classical constraints, localizing the path integral to classical solutions. The approach is extended to include a quadratic dilaton potential in JT gravity and applied to Bianchi IX, providing a systematic method for handling constraints in gravitational path integrals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic method for treating constraint structures in gravitational path integrals using functional determinant techniques, applicable to minisuperspace quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.

Method: 1. Applying the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem to compute functional determinants in JT gravity and Bianchi IX models. 2. Integrating out the dilaton or minisuperspace variables to derive functional delta enforcing constraints. 3. Calculating the Jacobian (functional determinant) via the Gelfand-Yaglom method. 4. Extending JT gravity analysis to include quadratic dilaton potential and analyzing saddle points. 5. Applying the method to Bianchi IX to derive fixed-lapse propagators with prefactors.

Result: Exact evaluation of functional determinants for fixed-lapse propagators in both models, confirming localization to classical solutions and correct semiclassical prefactors. Shows the method's applicability beyond specific cases to broader quantum gravity contexts.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust framework for handling constraints in gravitational path integrals, enabling precise calculations of propagators with correct measures and prefactors. It offers potential for extending to more complex quantum cosmology and quantum gravity models.

Abstract: We present a detailed evaluation of constrained minisuperspace path integrals in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and in biaxial Bianchi IX quantum cosmology, employing the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem to compute the relevant functional determinants. In both settings, integrating out the dilaton or a minisuperspace variable produces a functional delta that enforces the classical constraint equation, thereby localizing the remaining path integral onto classical configurations. The associated Jacobian, equivalently, the functional determinant of the operator obtained by linearizing the constraint about the classical solution, fixes the semiclassical prefactor and the correct measure. We evaluate this determinant exactly via the Gelfand-Yaglom method and obtain the fully normalized fixed-lapse propagators. We further extend the JT analysis to a quadratic dilaton potential $U(φ)=m^{2}φ^{2}$ and comment on the corresponding saddle-point structure of the lapse integral. Finally, we apply the same approach to Bianchi IX quantum cosmology and derive the fixed-lapse propagator, including its prefactor. Our results provide a systematic and broadly applicable prescription for treating constraint structures in gravitational path integrals using functional determinant techniques, with potential applications to a wider class of minisuperspace quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.

### [33] [Analytical Forms and Degeneracy of Quasinormal Modes for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21564)
*Zhong-Heng Li*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes for massless spin particles using the unified equation. Analytical solutions for frequencies and radial wave functions are derived, showing frequency dependence on black hole parameters and quantum numbers n, m, with wave functions additionally relying on k. Degeneracy in frequencies suggests that quasinormal modes of different particles with same quantum numbers are indistinguishable, enabling mimicking behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how quasinormal modes can reveal black hole parameters and explore if different particles can mimic each other's modes.

Method: The unified equation is applied to derive analytical expressions for quasinormal mode frequencies and radial wave functions of massless spin particles in Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spacetime.

Result: Frequencies depend solely on black hole parameters and quantum numbers n/m. Wave functions depend additionally on k, causing frequency degeneracy. Identical quantum numbers yield identical frequencies and degeneracy across particles.

Conclusion: Observations of quasinormal modes allow determination of black hole parameters and detection of particle mimicking phenomena. The work establishes a theoretical basis for this mimicking behavior.

Abstract: This study investigates the quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes for massless spin particles using the unified equation. We derive analytical expressions for both the quasinormal mode frequencies and the radial wave functions. The frequencies are determined exclusively by the black hole parameters and the quantum numbers $n$ and $m$, while the radial wave functions also depend on the quantum number $k$, indicating a degeneracy in frequency. For identical quantum numbers, the frequency expression and the degree of degeneracy are the same for all massless spin particles, regardless of their specific properties. This implies that, through the observation of quasinormal modes, one can not only determine the black hole's parameters but also observe the phenomenon in which one type of particle reproduces the quasinormal mode of another. Our work thus provides a theoretical foundation for understanding this mimicking behavior as well.

### [34] [Scattering of massless waves with arbitrary spin: a unified analysis for Schwarzschild-type medium black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21568)
*Zhong-Heng Li*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the scattering of massless spin particles by Schwarzschild-type medium black holes using a unified equation. An effective complex potential in curved spacetime leads to both real and imaginary logarithmic terms in the phase, with the imaginary part ensuring correct wave function decay. A unified differential cross-section formula is derived, applicable to all considered particle types. Experimental tests via transformation optics and implications for understanding gravitational wave scattering are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of curved spacetime on massless spin particles' scattering and derive a unified analytical framework that can be experimentally tested using Schwarzschild-equivalent media, potentially providing insights into astrophysical phenomena like black hole interactions with gravitational waves.

Method: Analytical investigation using a unified equation modeling scattering by a Schwarzschild-type medium black hole. Derived a complex effective potential analogous to Coulomb fields, separating into real and imaginary logarithmic contributions to the phase. Applied transformation optics to propose experimental verification with electromagnetic waves.

Result: Found that the imaginary part of the effective potential correctly accounts for wave function decay asymptotically. Derived a universal differential cross-section formula valid for all massless spin particles. Established experimental testability through metamaterial structures mimicking Schwarzschild geometry.

Conclusion: The developed framework successfully links theoretical spacetime effects to experimentally accessible systems, enabling empirical validation of black hole scattering predictions and offering a pathway to study gravitational wave interactions via analogous electromagnetic experiments.

Abstract: A unified equation is employed to analytically investigate the scattering of massless spin particles by a Schwarzschild-type medium black hole. It is found that for spin particles, curved spacetime induces an effective complex potential analogous to a Coulomb field. While the real part of this potential contributes a real logarithmic term to the phase, the imaginary part gives rise to a corresponding imaginary logarithmic term. Crucially, this imaginary term is precisely responsible for generating the correct asymptotic decay of the wave function. From this framework, a unified analytical expression for the differential cross section is derived, applicable to all particle types considered. Given the successful fabrication of a Schwarzschild-equivalent medium via transformation optics, our theoretical scattering predictions can be tested experimentally by transmitting plane electromagnetic waves through such a structure. Insights gained from these experiments could, in turn, shed light on the scattering of other massless fields (e.g., gravitational waves) by actual black holes.

### [35] [Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals I: Statistics Based on Time-Frequency Signal Tracks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21738)
*Zi-Xuan Wang,Gong Cheng,Ju Chen,Huai-Ke Guo,Andrew L. Miller*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called ΣTrack to detect mini-EMRIs, enabling ground-based gravitational wave detectors to probe sub-solar-mass compact objects like primordial black holes. The method addresses spectral leakage and provides a framework for analyzing signals with rapid frequency changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to detect mini-EMRIs, which are challenging due to their weak signals and rapid frequency evolution. These systems could confirm the existence of exotic compact objects such as primordial black holes, which are important for astrophysics and cosmology.

Method: The authors adapted quasi-monochromatic signal search methods and developed ΣTrack, which sums along time-frequency tracks of potential signals. They also created a semi-analytic sensitivity estimate for weak signals and a statistic to discretize search parameter spaces for various signal types.

Result: The ΣTrack method effectively handles spectral leakage and establishes a general basis for analyzing transient signals with rapid frequency changes. The sensitivity estimates and parameter space framework enable feasible mini-EMRI searches with current detectors.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational tools for mini-EMRI detection, demonstrating that existing ground-based interferometers can probe sub-solar-mass compact objects. This advances the potential of gravitational wave astronomy to explore exotic astrophysical phenomena.

Abstract: Mini-extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs), composed of a stellar-mass compact object and a much lighter companion, are promising sources of continuous gravitational waves in the frequency band of ground-based interferometers such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Such systems, consisting of sub-solar-mass compact objects, provide a unique probe of exotic compact objects, including primordial black holes. Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $Σ$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types. Our results provide a foundation for mini-EMRI searches and demonstrate the potential of current ground-based detectors to probe the existence of sub-solar-mass compact objects.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (mini-EMRIs), comprising a sub-solar exotic compact object (such as a primordial black hole or boson star) orbiting a much heavier stellar-origin or exotic compact object, represent key targets for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors to probe the early universe and the nature of dark matter. However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $Σ$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $ΣR$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\,M_\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This approach can be similarly applied to EMRI searches for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.

### [37] [Impact of neglecting center-of-mass acceleration in parameter estimation of stellar-mass black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21979)
*Suvikranth Gera,Poulami Dutta Roy*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines how the acceleration of a binary black hole system's center-of-mass, influenced by a nearby tertiary body, affects gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation in next-generation detectors like CE and ET. Significant systematic biases in chirp mass and mass ratio estimates occur when neglecting this acceleration, even at small amplitudes, with 3G detectors capable of constraining these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GW detectors lack low-frequency sensitivity to detect CoM acceleration effects from BBHs near supermassive black holes. Future 3G detectors will have better sensitivity, necessitating the exploration of CoM acceleration's role in parameter inference.

Method: The authors analyze the parameter space where CoM acceleration dominantly affects BBH parameter estimation. They simulate waveforms with and without CoM acceleration, quantifying biases in chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio when neglecting the acceleration. Sensitivity studies for CE and ET are conducted to assess detectability thresholds of the CoM parameter α.

Result: Neglecting small CoM acceleration (α ~1e-9 for CE, 1e-10 for ET) in low-mass BBHs causes systematic biases larger than statistical errors in chirp mass and mass ratio. Asymmetric binaries show greater susceptibility. When including the CoM effect, 3G detectors can constrain α to 1e-9 (CE) or 1e-11 (ET) for α=1e-7.

Conclusion: The CoM acceleration from tertiary bodies must be considered in 3G GW analyses to avoid systematic errors. Future detectors' extended low-frequency sensitivity will enable precise constraints on these effects, crucial for accurate astrophysical interpretations of BBH mergers.

Abstract: A tertiary body near a coalescing binary can imprint its influence on the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by that binary in the form of center-of-mass (CoM) acceleration. An example of such a scenario is a binary black hole (BBH) merging near a supermassive black hole, which is touted to occur frequently. The limited low-frequency sensitivity of current GW detectors makes it challenging to detect these effects, as the associated waveform phase remains elusive. However, next-generation (3G) detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), with improved sensitivity at lower frequencies, are expected to be capable of capturing such signatures. In our study, we focus on the stellar-mass BBHs and explore the parameter space where the CoM acceleration will play a dominant role affecting parameter inference of the binary. We demonstrate that an unaccounted CoM acceleration of a low-mass binary with a total mass of $5\, \rm{M}_{\odot} $ can lead to significant systematic biases, exceeding statistical errors in the estimation of the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio when the CoM parameter $α$ is as small as $\sim 10^{-9}$ and $10^{-10}$ $\rm{s}^{-1}$ for CE and ET, respectively. We also find that asymmetric binaries are more susceptible to systematic bias when CoM acceleration is neglected. When the effect of CoM acceleration is included in the GW phase, then $α= 10^{-7} \rm s^{-1}$ can be constrained with a bound of $10^{-9} (10^{-11})\, \rm s^{-1}$ for CE (ET). Our study thus highlights the crucial implications of considering the presence of a tertiary body in the GW emitted by a stellar-mass BBH when observed in 3G detectors.

*Tayyab Naseer,M. Sharif*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates anisotropic compact stars in modified f(R,T,Q) gravity using Finch-Skea metric and MIT bag model. It validates models I and II with observational data from eight stars, ensuring viability and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore compact star structures in modified gravity, address challenges from extra degrees of freedom in field equations, and ensure models align with astrophysical observations.

Method: Spherically symmetric metric applied to f(R,T,Q) models with Q = R_{αγ}T^{αγ}. Finch-Skea metric and MIT bag equation of state used to solve equations. Matching conditions determined constants. Graphical analysis and stability tests conducted. Model parameters derived via vanishing radial pressure for observed star data.

Result: Models I and II show viability and stability. Calculated model parameters match observed radii and masses of eight stars. Graphical analysis supports physically relevant interiors.

Conclusion: Proposed models satisfy necessary physical conditions for anisotropic compact star interiors in modified gravity, aligning with observational data.

Abstract: In this article, we are devoted to discuss different compact stars admitting anisotropic interiors in a particular modified theory of gravity. For this purpose, a spherically symmetric metric is adopted to formulate the field equations corresponding to two different $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{Q})$ models, where $\mathcal{Q}=\mathcal{R}_{αγ}\mathcal{T}^{αγ}$. Since the field equations contain extra degrees of freedom, we choose Finch-Skea metric and MIT bag model equation of state to make them solvable. We also use matching conditions to calculate a constant triplet in the chosen ansatz. The resulting solutions are then graphically analyzed for particular values of the bag constant and model parameter in the interior of 4U 1820-30 compact star. The viability and stability of the modified models are also checked through certain tests. Further, we calculate the values of model parameter through the vanishing radial pressure constraint that correspond to the observed data (radii and masses) of eight different star candidates. Finally, we conclude that our models I and II are in well-agreement with the conditions needed for physically relevant interiors to exist.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines thermodynamics and entanglement islands in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, resolving the information paradox by showing radiation entropy saturates at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, confirming unitarity and deriving Page/scrambling times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand black hole thermodynamics near evaporation endpoints and resolve the information paradox by incorporating entanglement island contributions.

Method: Analyzing Hawking temperature, heat capacity, entropy, and mass-radius relations; computing radiation entropy with/without islands, extremizing generalized entropy functional.

Result: Temperature decreases with mass near endpoint (indicating phase transition/stable remnant), radiation entropy saturates at Bekenstein-Hawking value, Page and scrambling times derived.

Conclusion: Entanglement islands resolve information paradox, confirm unitary black hole evolution, and provide consistent thermodynamic framework within asymptotically safe quantum gravity.

Abstract: We study thermodynamic properties and the entanglement island of a black hole in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, analyzing key thermodynamic quantities such as the Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy, as well as the mass-horizon radius relation. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes, the temperature decreases with mass near the evaporation endpoint, signaling a phase transition and possible stable remnant. The entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is obtained both with and without island contributions. Without islands, the radiation entropy grows linearly indefinitely, leading to the information paradox. By including island contributions and extremizing the generalized entropy functional, we resolve this paradox. At late times, the radiation entropy saturates at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, confirming unitary evolution. From this, we derive the Page time and scrambling time by equating early- and late-time entanglement entropies. The result of this study establishes the finiteness of the radiation entropy and consistency with quantum mechanics.

*Oscar Meneses Rojas*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper refines the classification of black hole crease sets using singularity theory in contact geometry, extending previous work by Gadioux & Reall. It identifies new components of crease sets connected to null infinity and clarifies the stability of the event horizon birth region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify and establish the stability of black hole crease sets, building on singularity theory to address gaps in prior classifications regarding components causally connected to null infinity.

Method: Adopts contact geometry and Legendrian submanifolds' projections to analyze BigFronts, applying Arnol'd's singularity theory to classify crease and cuspidal sets. Refines stability arguments for the event horizon's creation and identifies additional crease set components.

Result: Shows that the event horizon birth (unstable component) is not causally connected to null infinity, while discovering stable crease components connected to null infinity. Extends Gadioux & Reall's classification by considering all BigFront components.

Conclusion: Singularity theory in contact geometry provides a robust framework for black hole horizon analysis. The findings enhance understanding of horizon formation and stability by distinguishing between causally disconnected and connected crease set components.

Abstract: A classical result by Penrose establishes that null geodesics generating a black hole event horizon can only intersect at their entrance to the horizon in ``crossover'' points. This points together with limit points of this set, namely caustics, form the so-called "crease set". Light rays enter into the horizon through the crease set, characterizing the latter as the birth of the horizon. A natural question in this context refers to the classification and stability of the structural possibilities of black hole crease sets. In this work we revisit the strategy adopted by Gadioux & Reall for such a classification in the setting of singularity theory in contact geometry. Specifically, in such contact geometry setting, the event horizon is identified as a component (not connected to null infinity) of a so-called ``BigFront''. The characterization of BigFronts as Legendrian projections of Legendrian submanifolds permits to classify the crease sets and ``cuspidal sets'' (or caustics in Penrose's terminology) by applying classical results established by V.I. Arnol'd. Here we refine the stability discussion presented by Gadioux & Reall of that connected component of the crease set that is not causally connected to null infinity and that constitutes the event horizon birth. In addition, we identify the existence of other components of the crease set that lie in the part of the BigFront that is causally connected to null infinity.

Method: Uses a theoretical framework based on mass-to-horizon scaling (M ∝ Lⁿ) leading to an entropic functional Sₙ ∝ Lⁿ⁺¹. Employs Bayesian analysis with Pantheon+ SN data, SH0ES calibration, DESI BAO, CMB priors, and structure growth observations.

Result: Entropic models are statistically preferred over ΛCDM via Bayesian model comparison, indicating their better fit to observational data.

Conclusion: Cosmic acceleration likely arises from entropic forces on the cosmological horizon, offering a viable alternative to the cosmological constant.

Abstract: We investigate the observational tests of generalized mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology by incorporating large-scale structure growth data in addition to purely geometric probes. The theoretical framework is constructed from a generalized mass-to-horizon scaling relation, $M \propto L^n$, which implies a corresponding generalized entropic functional $S_n \propto L^{n+1}$. Within this setting, cosmic acceleration arises as an emergent phenomenon driven by an entropic force acting on the cosmological horizon. While earlier studies demonstrated that these entropic cosmologies can reproduce the background expansion history of the standard $Λ$CDM model, here we present a comprehensive observational analysis that jointly employs Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova data with SH0ES calibration, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance priors, and a suite of cosmological structure growth observations. A Bayesian model comparison indicates that the entropic models are statistically preferred over the conventional $Λ$CDM scenario, thereby providing strong support for an entropic origin of the observed late-time cosmic acceleration in place of a fundamental cosmological constant.

### [42] [On the Cooling of Compact Stars in Light of the HESS J1731-347 Remnant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21406)
*D. Nanopoulos,P. Laskos-Patkos,Ch. C. Moustakidis*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the nature of the central compact object in HESS J1731-347 by analyzing its mass, radius, temperature, and age. It concludes that hadronic, hybrid, or strange quark matter stars could explain observations if specific conditions (like superconductivity and blocked Urca processes) are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the object is a hadronic, hybrid, or quark star by reconciling observational data (mass, radius, temperature, age) with theoretical models, especially examining the role of symmetry energy and neutrino emission processes.

Method: The authors analyze structural parameters (M=0.77±0.20 M☉, R=10.4±0.86 km) and thermal properties (153±4 keV temperature at 2-6 kyrs age) to test hadronic, hybrid, and quark matter models. For hybrid stars, they study symmetry energy effects on neutrino processes and cooling curves. Quark matter's superconductivity and Urca process inhibition are evaluated.

Result: Hadronic models match observations with or without pairing effects. Hybrid stars require superconducting strange cores and soft hadronic phases to block direct Urca. Strange stars also fit if quark superconductivity and blocked direct Urca are present.

Conclusion: Multiple stellar types can explain the object under specific conditions, emphasizing the role of superconductivity and neutrino emission blocking in cooling mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent analyses on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant reported not only surprising structural properties (mass $M$ and radius $R$), but also an interesting thermal evolution. More precisely, it has been estimated that $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_\odot$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km (at the $1σ$ level), while a redshited surface temperature of $153^{+4}_ {-2}$ keV at an age of 2-6 kyrs has been reported. In the present work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the possible nature (hadronic, hybrid, quark) of this compact object by attempting to not only explain its mass and radius but also the corresponding estimations for its temperature and age. In the case of hybrid stars we also examine possible effects of the symmetry energy on the activation of different neutrino emitting process, and hence on the resulting cooling curves. We found that the reported temperature and age may be compatible to hadronic stellar configurations regardless of whether pairing effects are included. In the scenario of hybrid stars, we found that the strange quark matter core has to be in a superconducting state in order to reach an agreement with the observational constraints. In addition, the hadronic phase must be soft enough so that the direct Urca process is not activated. Furthermore, we have shown that the considered cooling constraints can be reconciled within the framework of strange stars. However, quark matter has to be in a superconducting state and the quark direct Urca process needs to be blocked.

### [43] [Impact of the EPOS.LHC-R hadronic interaction model on the Centaurus A ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21415)
*Silvia Mollerach,Esteban Roulet*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper examines the effects of the EPOS.LHC-R hadronic model on the hypothesis that high-energy cosmic rays above 5 EeV primarily originate from the Centaurus A radio galaxy. The model suggests a heavier cosmic ray composition, altering emission estimates and influencing elemental contributions across energy regions. Predictions for dipolar anisotropy and a new method for determining cosmic ray masses via air shower analysis are also presented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the updated EPOS.LHC-R hadronic interaction model impacts the cosmic ray origin scenario linked to Centaurus A, particularly regarding composition and anisotropy measurements.

Method: The study applies the EPOS.LHC-R model to reassess cosmic ray composition and emission from Centaurus A. It models elemental contributions (CNO, Si, Fe groups) across energy spectra and calculates dipolar anisotropy predictions under varying magnetic field and source lifetime parameters. A novel technique correlating air shower maximum depth with cosmic ray mass is introduced.

Result: The model shows reduced H/He emissions from Centaurus A compared to prior models, with CNO group dominance near the ankle and significant Si/Fe contributions above 50 EeV. Dipolar anisotropy predictions align with observations for plausible magnetic field/source lifetime values. The new mass determination method enhances compositional analysis.

Conclusion: The EPOS.LHC-R model strengthens the Centaurus A cosmic ray origin hypothesis by resolving compositional discrepancies and aligning anisotropy predictions with data. The proposed mass analysis method offers improved tools for interpreting air shower observations.

Abstract: We discuss the impact of the recent EPOS.LHC-R hadronic interaction model on the scenario in which most of the cosmic rays with energies above 5 EeV originate in the nearby Centaurus A radiogalaxy. The heavier composition inferred when considering this hadronic model implies that the amount of H and He emitted by the source is reduced compared to what was found with previous hadronic models. The elements of the CNO group play a more predominant role in the instep region just above the ankle while the elements of the Si and Fe groups can contribute significantly in the suppression region of the energy spectrum above 50 EeV. We also obtain the predictions for the amplitude of the dipolar anisotropy in different energy bins above 4 EeV, showing that they can be well consistent with the measurements for appropriate values of the extragalactic turbulent magnetic field and source lifetime. A new method to extract the information on the cosmic ray masses from that of the depth of the maximum development of the air showers is also introduced.

### [44] [Numerical Simulations of the Circularized Accretion Flow in Population III Star Tidal Disruption Events. I. The Accretion Flow and the Wind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21500)
*Yu-Heng Sheng,De-Fu Bu,Xiao-Hong Yang,Yi-Ren Chang,Liang Chen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the properties of accretion flows and winds in Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes and Population III stars using radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Key findings include a highly super-Eddington accretion rate, a strong radiation-driven wind removing 65-75% of fallback debris, and wind kinetic power up to ~1e46 erg/s, which may aid in interpreting TDE radiation via wind reprocessing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the poorly understood accretion flow and wind properties in Pop III star TDE systems, which are potential probes of early Universe stellar populations and high-energy astrophysical processes.

Method: Radiative hydrodynamic simulations modeling circularized accretion flows in a system with a 10^6 solar mass black hole and 300 solar mass Pop III star, focusing on wind dynamics.

Result: The accretion rate is highly super-Eddington; radiation pressure drives a strong wind that carries away 65-75% of fallback material, leaving 25-35% accreted by the BH. Wind kinetic power reaches ~1e46 erg/s.

Conclusion: These wind properties provide critical insights for interpreting Pop III TDE radiation through wind reprocessing models, offering a framework to connect observational signatures with underlying accretion/wind mechanisms.

Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have recently been proposed as potential probes for Population III stars. However, the properties of the accretion flow and the wind from the Pop III star TDE system are not clear. By performing radiative hydrodynamic simulations, we study the 'circularized' accretion flow of the Pop III star TDE system. The masses of the black hole (BH) and the disrupted star are $10^6$ and $300$ solar masses, respectively. We focus on the properties of the wind. We find that the black hole accretion rate is highly super-Eddington. A strong wind is driven by radiation pressure. Due to the presence of a strong wind, only $25\%$--$35\%$ of the fallback debris is accreted by the BH. The remaining part is taken away by the wind. The kinetic power of the wind can be as high as $10^{46} {\rm \ erg \ s^{-1}}$. The properties of the wind obtained in this paper may be useful for understanding the radiation properties of Pop III star TDEs in the context of the wind 'reprocessing' model.

### [45] [Multiband Gravitational Wave Detection Prospects for M31 UCXB-1 System in Low and Middle Frequency Band](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21520)
*Xiao Guo,Zhoujian Cao,Zhiwei Chen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The discovery of M31 UCXB-1, a potential BH-WD system in M31 with a 465-second orbital period, is analyzed for its gravitational wave (GW) detectability. Middle-frequency detectors like DECIGO and BBO may achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratios (S/N >8) within a decade, while low-frequency detectors face challenges. Orbital eccentricity enhances GW strain at higher harmonics, aiding detectability. This system serves as a critical prototype for multiband GW studies and X-ray astronomy synergy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M31 UCXB-1's unique properties (short orbital period, high X-ray luminosity) make it an ideal candidate for studying UCXB evolution and GW emission. Its extragalactic nature and potential as a strong BH-WD system position it as a key target for next-generation GW detectors, bridging X-ray observations with gravitational wave astronomy.

Method: The study evaluates GW detectability using signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) calculations for future space-borne detectors (low-frequency: LISA-scale; middle-frequency: DECIGO/BBO). Simulations account for observational durations (10 years), detector sensitivities, and the impact of orbital eccentricity on harmonics enhancement.

Result: Middle-frequency detectors (DECIGO/BBO) can achieve S/N >8 within a decade, while low-frequency detectors struggle. Eccentric orbits amplify GW strain, especially beneficial for middle-frequency instruments. BBO alone or a combined detector network could reach required S/N with the primary mass constraints (5.4-6.6 M☉).

Conclusion: M31 UCXB-1 is a cornerstone for multiband GW astrophysics. It provides a critical testbed for detector networks and demonstrates the importance of middle-frequency GW observatories. The study underscores its role in linking X-ray astronomy with the emerging GW era, emphasizing its value for multi-messenger studies.

Abstract: The recent discovery of M31 UCXB-1, the first extragalactic ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) with an orbital period of $T_{\rm orb} \sim 465$ s, presents a unique laboratory for studying close binary evolution and an unprecedented target for continuous gravitational wave (GW) searches. Its identification as a strong candidate black hole-white dwarf (BH-WD) system, combined with its exceptionally short period and high X-ray luminosity, suggests it may be one of the most vital low-frequency GW sources in M31. In this \textit{Letter}, we investigate the detectability of its GW signal for future space-borne detectors in multiband GW detection. We find that while its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for low-frequency detectors remains marginal for high-confidence detection, middle-frequency detectors such as DECIGO and BBO are far more promising, potentially achieving S/N $\varrho>8$ within reasonable observational duration. With a primary mass of only $m_1 > 5.4M_\odot$ (or $6.6M_\odot$), the network of all low and middle frequency detector (or BBO alone) is capable of detecting GW from this system with a $\varrho > 8$, during 10-year observation. Furthermore, orbital eccentricity can enhance the GW strain at higher harmonics, further improving its detectability, especially for middle-frequency detectors. This study establishes M31 UCXB-1 as a key prototype of short-period UCXBs, cementing its role as a cornerstone for multiband, multi-messenger astrophysics and a vital bridge between X-ray astronomy and the future GW era.

### [46] [VLBI Diagnostics of Off-axis Jets in Radio Flares of Tidal Disruption Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21669)
*Tatsuya Matsumoto*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores two scenarios for late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events, finding that VLBI imaging can distinguish between a delayed outflow and an off-axis jet through centroid motion and image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the origin of late-time radio flares, particularly in AT2018hyz, by comparing delayed-outflow and off-axis jet models using VLBI signatures.

Method: Simulated synthetic radio images for both models, analyzing emission centroid motion and image characteristics like aspect ratio changes.

Result: The delayed-outflow model shows non-relativistic centroid motion, while the off-axis jet produces superluminal motion and non-monotonic aspect ratio evolution in images.

Conclusion: VLBI observations detecting superluminal motion confirm off-axis jets, with findings applicable to other jetted phenomena like microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.

Abstract: The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio. These results are expected to be generic and applicable to other jetted explosions, such as microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.

*Xu-Lin Dong,Wei-Kang Gao,Yi-Qing Guo,Shu-Wang Cui*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses AMS-02 and DAMPE data with the SDP model to show that spectral indices of cosmic-ray elements with A/Z=2 correlate positively with Z and A due to fragmentation effects, predicting Ni and Zn spectra to converge with Fe but remain slightly softer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve discrepancies between theoretical predictions (identical spectral indices for same rigidity) and observed variations in cosmic-ray element spectra.

Method: Applied SDP model to analyze AMS-02 and DAMPE observations, comparing spectral indices of elements (focus on A/Z=2) and their dependency on Z/A. Predicted future alignment of Ni/Zn spectra with Fe.

Result: Spectral indices positively correlate with Z/A for A/Z=2 elements; Ni/Zn spectra will align with Fe but have softer injection spectra. Observations from HERD/AMS-02/DAMPE required for verification.

Conclusion: Fragmentation cross-section dependence explains spectral variations, but theoretical models must better explain these effects and guide future observational validation.

Abstract: Under ideal conditions, the theory of shock acceleration for cosmic rays predicts that different elements should exhibit strictly identical spectral indices when accelerated to the same rigidity (R). However, recent high-precision measurements of elemental energy spectra have definitively established the existence of variations in spectral indices across different elements. This study constrains the spectral indices of cosmic-ray elements using AMS-02 and DAMPE observations within the Spatially Dependent Propagation (SDP) model. For elements with A/Z = 2, spectral indices shows significant positive correlations with both atomic number Z and mass number A, likely due to A or Z-dependent fragmentation cross-sections. Predictions indicate that the observed spectra of Ni and Zn will align with the Fe spectrum, while their injection spectra will exhibit slightly softer spectral indices compared to Fe. Future observations from AMS-02, DAMPE and HERD are expected to verify these findings, while theoretical models are needed to systematically explain this phenomenon.

### [48] [Spectral State Switching in Mrk 421: Results from the AstroSat LAXPC/SXT Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21885)
*Sikandar Akbar,Zahir Shah,Ranjeev Misra,Naseer Iqbal*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes X-ray variability and spectral properties of the blazar Mrk 421 using AstroSat and LAXPC20/SXT data, revealing two distinct spectral states and a double-lognormal flux distribution linked to synchrotron processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the X-ray flux variability and spectral behavior of Mrk 421, particularly focusing on the role of synchrotron processes and acceleration mechanisms in blazars.

Method: Time and flux-resolved X-ray spectral analysis using 100s-binned light curves from AstroSat and LAXPC20/SXT observations. Flux states were categorized into ten bins, fitted with synchrotron-convolved broken power-law models, and compared with log-parabola models. Time-resolved spectroscopy (10-ks segments) and additional observations (2017-2019) were used to confirm spectral state persistence.

Result: Mrk 421 exhibits significant flux variability (F_rms values of 0.21-0.32), with spectra best fit by broken power-law models showing two low-energy spectral indices and migrating break energies. Flux states follow a double lognormal distribution, and index histograms are bimodal, indicating two persistent spectral states over time.

Conclusion: The dual spectral states and lognormal flux distribution suggest that Mrk 421's emission arises from Gaussian fluctuations in particle acceleration, consistent with a leptonic synchrotron model. This implies that blazar variability may be driven by stochastic acceleration processes rather than abrupt changes in jet dynamics.

Abstract: We carried a detailed time and flux resolved X-ray spectral analysis of the high-synchrotron-peaked blazar Mrk\,421 using simultaneous AstroSat and LAXPC20/SXT observations. The 100\,s binned LAXPC20 light curve obtained during 3--8 January 2017 reveals pronounced flux variability. The source exhibits a fractional variability amplitude of $F_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.210 \pm 0.005$ in the SXT band and $F_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.316 \pm 0.006$ in the LAXPC20 band. During this interval, the source reached a peak count rate of 122.94\,counts\,s$^{-1}$. This enabled us to carry flux resolved spectroscopy by selecting ten flux states, S1--S10 each having a width of 8\,counts\,s$^{-1}$. We noted that the spectra in these flux states are well described by a synchrotron-convolved broken power-law (BPL), which consistently provides a better fit than a log-parabola. The low-energy particle index (index before the break) is found to cluster around two discrete values across flux states indicating two spectra states in the source. The break energy consistently moves to high energy with increase in flux level in these states. Time-resolved spectroscopy (10-ks segments) confirms that the flux histogram is best modelled as a double lognormal distribution and the index histogram is bimodal. Inclusion of two additional long observations spanning 2017-2019 shows the same double-state behaviour on longer timescales. Together, the results indicate that Mrk\,421 routinely occupies two dominant spectral; in a leptonic synchrotron framework this can be explained by Gaussian-like fluctuations in acceleration conditions producing lognormal flux states.

### [49] [Long-term monitoring of repeating FRB 20220912A with the uGMRT at low radio frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21889)
*Ajay Kumar,Yogesh Maan,Banshi Lal,Yash Bhusare,Shriharsh P. Tendulkar,Visweshwar Ram Marthi,Puja Majee*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: FRB 20220912A is a hyperactive repeating fast radio burst (FRB) with sustained high activity over 500 days, emitting 643 bursts. Its energy distribution patterns align with other active repeaters and support magnetar models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study FRB 20220912A's prolonged active phase to understand FRB emission mechanisms and progenitor systems.

Method: Long-term monitoring with uGMRT (300-750 MHz) over nearly two years, analyzing burst rates and energy distributions.

Result: Detected 643 bursts; observed sustained activity with irregular modulations, consistent energy distribution breaks with other repeaters, and no short-periodicity.

Conclusion: FRB 20220912A's characteristics favor magnetar models as progenitors, indicating young dynamic magnetars emitting across broad rotational phases.

Abstract: Some repeating FRBs exhibit occasional extreme repetition rates, but very few show a sustained high activity level. One such hyperactive repeater is FRB 20220912A, which was discovered by CHIME/FRB Collaboration on 2022 September 12. Here, we present results from a long-term monitoring campaign of FRB 20220912A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the frequency range from 300 to 750 MHz. Over the course of nearly two years, we detected a total of 643 bursts in this frequency range. The source exhibited extreme activity for a few months after its discovery and sustained its active phase for over 500 days, with unsystematic modulations in the activity during this phase. The cumulative energy distributions in both bands show a break, consistent with other active repeaters like FRB 20121102A, FRB 202011124A, etc., suggesting common underlying emission mechanisms. Moreover, we show that the energy distribution shape for FRB 20220912A remains broadly same across a large range of frequencies and over time. Overall, the extended high activity, estimated total energy output, persistent power-law tails in the energy distributions, and the lack of detectable short timescale periodicity favor progenitor models invoking young dynamic magnetars, potentially emitting pulses across large rotation phase ranges.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of PSR J1857+0943 using FAST reveals that its third main-pulse component (MP_C3) shares a common origin with the interpulse, challenging the assumption that main pulses and interpulses originate from opposite magnetic poles. This discovery highlights the complexity of MSP magnetospheres and the importance of single-pulse analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate subpulse variability in millisecond pulsars and challenge existing assumptions about emission region origins, particularly the idea that main pulses and interpulses come from opposite magnetic poles.

Method: Analysis of single-pulse variability using FAST data, including LRCCF anticorrelation measurements, single-pulse polarization analysis, modulation period comparison, and reduced modulation index observations.

Result: Four observational lines of evidence show MP_C3's link to the interpulse: anticorrelation with interpulse via LRCCF, component mixing in polarization, doubling modulation period ratio, and reduced modulation index. Jitter timing measured at 78±3 ns over one hour aligns with prior studies.

Conclusion: PSR J1857+0943 serves as a critical case study demonstrating that main pulses can involve emissions from multiple magnetic poles, altering our understanding of MSP magnetospheric geometry and dynamics. Single-pulse diagnostics are essential for such insights.

Abstract: Studies of subpulse variability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) offer important constraints on their emission physics. Using the high sensitivity of FAST, we present the first identification of distinct single pulse fluctuation behaviour in PSR J1857+0943. We find that the third component(MP\_C3) of the main pulse may originate from a different region than the other two main-pulse components and may instead share a common origin with the interpulse. This conclusion is supported by four observational evidence as follows: First, the LRCCF shows a clear anticorrelation between MP\_C3 and the interpulse. Second, the single-pulse polarization at the main-pulse longitude reveals obvious component mixing. Third, the modulation period of the interpulse components is roughly twice that of MP\_C3. Fourth, the reduced modulation index in MP\_C3 suggests possible mixing of emission from different regions. The interpretation in this letter contrasts with the usual assumption that the main pulse and interpulse originate from opposite magnetic poles. Hence, PSR J1857+0943 provides a rare laboratory for probing component-dependent plasma behaviour in an MSP magnetosphere. Our results offer direct evidence that the main pulse can include emission associated with more than one magnetic pole and highlight the importance of single-pulse diagnostics for understanding the geometry and dynamics of pulsars with interpulse emission. In addition, we analyse the jitter properties of this pulsar and measure a one-hour jitter of $σ_{J,1\rm h} = 78 \pm 3~\mathrm{ns}$ at 1.25 GHz, consistent with previous studies.

*Qing-Chang Zhao,Michal Dovciak,Han-Cheng Li,Lian Tao,Hua Feng,Federico Vincentelli,Giorgio Matt,Philip Kaaret,Shuang-Nan Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Polarization analysis of GRS 1739-278's 2025 outburst reveals extreme black hole spin (a≈0.99) and disk geometry using IXPE/NuSTAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the accretion disk geometry, black hole spin, and relativistic effects in the soft state of GRS 1739-278 through multi-wavelength X-ray polarimetry and spectroscopy.

Method: Joint analysis of simultaneous IXPE (polarization) and NuSTAR (spectroscopy) data, including broadband spectral modeling and Stokes spectrum fitting with the kynbbrr model to assess reflected radiation contributions and relativistic effects.

Result: High polarization degree increase with energy (2% at 2 keV to 10% at 6-8 keV), stable PA (~62°), inferred spin a=0.994, inclination i=54°, confirming returning radiation dominates polarization from a highly tilted, spinning black hole system.

Conclusion: X-ray polarimetry combined with spectral analysis effectively probes accretion disk geometry and relativistic effects, validating extreme black hole spin measurements and the role of returning radiation in polarization.

Abstract: We present a joint spectro-polarimetric analysis of the black hole X-ray binary GRS~1739--278 during its 2025 mini-outburst, using simultaneous observations from \ixpe\ and \nustar. The \ixpe\ data show a polarization degree of ${\rm PD} = (2.3 \pm 0.4)\%$ and a polarization angle of ${\rm PA} = 62^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2--8~keV range. The model-independent analysis reveals that the PD increases from $\sim 2\%$ at 2~keV to $\sim 10\%$ in the 6--8~keV band, while the PA remains stable across the \ixpe\ band within statistical uncertainties. Broadband spectral modeling of the combined \ixpe\ and \nustar\ datasets shows that hard Comptonization contributes negligibly in this soft-state observation, while a substantial reflected component is required in addition to the thermal disk emission. We then model the \ixpe\ Stokes spectra using the \texttt{kynbbrr} model. The best-fitting results indicate that high-spin configurations enhance the contribution of reflected returning radiation, which dominates the observed polarization properties. From the \texttt{kynbbrr} modeling, we infer an extreme black hole spin of $a = 0.994^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ and a system inclination of $i = 54^\circ{}^{+8^\circ}_{-4^\circ}$. Owing to the large contribution from returning radiation, the observed polarization direction is nearly parallel to the projected system axis, the position angle of which is predicted to be $58^\circ \pm 4^\circ$. Our results demonstrate that X-ray polarimetry, combined with broadband spectroscopy, directly probes the geometry and relativistic effects in accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes.

### [52] [Superradiant and dynamical spin-down of neutron stars with gravitational wave implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21955)
*Indra Kumar Banerjee,Sandeep Chatterjee,Biswarup Das,Ujjal Kumar Dey*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes superradiant spin-down as an additional mechanism to explain anomalous spin variations in neutron stars, alongside conventional processes like electromagnetic dipole radiation and gravitational waves. It explores the interplay between these mechanisms and their impacts on rotational evolution, while also examining gravitational-wave emissions and axion-induced phenomena as multimessenger probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalous spin variations, such as sudden enhanced spin-down rates in neutron stars, cannot be fully explained by known mechanisms (e.g., electromagnetic dipole radiation, gravitational waves, r-mode oscillations, fallback accretion). The authors seek to identify a missing spin-down mechanism to account for these observations.

Method: The study models the combined effects of conventional spin-down processes (EM radiation, gravitational waves, r-modes) and the proposed superradiant spin-down mechanism. It analyzes their interplay on neutron star rotational evolution and evaluates gravitational-wave emission from quadrupole deformation and r-modes, alongside axion-induced bosonic clouds, as detectable signals for multimessenger astronomy.

Result: Superradiant spin-down is identified as a viable explanation for anomalous spin behaviors. The interplay between mechanisms influences rotational evolution timescales. Gravitational-wave signatures from deformation and r-modes, coupled with axion-related phenomena, are highlighted as promising targets for upcoming detector experiments.

Conclusion: Superradiant processes should be considered alongside traditional mechanisms in neutron star spin evolution models. Multimessenger observations combining electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data will be critical to confirm these effects and refine our understanding of dense matter physics and neutron star dynamics.

Abstract: Neutron stars such as pulsars and magnetars lose angular momentum primarily through electromagnetic dipole radiation, gravitational waves, $r$-mode oscillation, and also affected by fallback accretion processes. However, anomalous spin variations, particularly sudden enhanced spin-down rates, indicate additional spin-down mechanisms. We propose superradiant spin-down as a potential explanation for these events. By modelling the interplay between conventional and superradiant spin-down channels, we evaluate their impact on neutron star rotational evolution. We also discuss gravitational-wave emission produced by quadrupole deformation, $r$-mode oscillations, and axion-induced bosonic clouds around an isolated neutron star, highlighting their potential as distinct multimessenger probes in upcoming detectors.

TL;DR: The study analyzes the optical variability of blazar Ton 599 over 12 years, revealing complex color behavior linked to different emission mechanisms. Key findings include log-normal flux distributions, a positive RMS-flux relation, size estimates of the emission region (~1e16 cm), magnetic field (~1e3 G), and a supermassive black hole mass (~1e8 solar masses).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical processes driving variability in active galactic nuclei through detailed optical monitoring, constraining parameters like emission region size, magnetic field, and black hole mass using multiwavelength data.

Method: Multi-band photometric monitoring (BVRI), spectral analysis of Mg II line, statistical methods (RMS-flux relation, PSD analysis, χ² tests), light curve segmentation, and color-magnitude/time diagrams to characterize variability and infer astrophysical parameters.

Result: Observed flux log-normal distributions, red-noise PSDs, intranight variability indicating compact emission regions (~1e16 cm, ~1e3 G), and SMBH mass ~1e8 M⊙. Color variability showed thermal-dominated reddening at low fluxes, jet orientation effects at intermediate levels, and synchrotron-dominated bluing at high fluxes.

Conclusion: Ton 599's optical variability is driven by a combination of thermal and non-thermal processes, with emission mechanisms varying with flux state. The findings support models where accretion disk and jet dynamics contribute to observed color-flux behaviors in blazars.

Abstract: (Shortened)Context: We analyze the optical variability of the FSRQ Ton 599 using BVRI photometry from the WEBT collaboration (2011-2023), complemented by photometric and spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory.\\ Aims: To characterize short- and long-term optical variability -- including flux distributions, intranight changes, color evolution, and spectra -- to constrain physical parameters and processes in the central engine.\\ Methods: We tested flux distributions in each filter against normal and log-normal, explored the RMS-flux relation and derived PSDs. We quantified intranight variability using a $χ^2$ test and fractional variability. From variability timescales, we estimated the emitting region size and magnetic field. Long-term variability was studied by segmenting the light curve into 12 intervals and analyzing flux statistics. For multi-filter flares, we computed spectral slopes, redshift-corrected fluxes, monochromatic luminosities and generated Color-magnitude and color-time diagrams. From low-flux spectra, we measured Mg II line and estimated the black hole mass.\\ Results: Ton 599 showed strong optical variability. Log-normal distributions fit the fluxes better, and all bands show a positive RMS-flux relation with red-noise PSDs.Intranight variability is detected, and used in constraining the emission region and magnetic field.The R band reaches a peak flux of 23.5 mJy, corresponding to a monochromatic luminosity of $log(νLν)= 48.48 [erg/s]$. We found a redder-when-brighter trend at low fluxes (thermal), achromatic behavior at intermediate levels (possibly due to jet orientation changes), and a bluer-when-brighter trend at high fluxes (synchrotron). Long-term color changes are modest, short-term are significant, with a negative correlation between the amplitude of color changes and the average flux. The estimated SMBH mass is order of $10^8 M_\odot$.

### [54] [Inferring Eccentricity of Binary Black Holes from Spin-Orbit Misalignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22044)
*Vishal Baibhav*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to recover the eccentricity of binary black hole (BBH) systems at formation by leveraging spin-orbit misalignment, which is influenced by natal kicks from supernovae. Applying this method to GW190412 and GW241011, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of estimating formation eccentricity even without direct eccentricity measurements. Future detectors will enhance precision, enabling comprehensive insights into BBH birth environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orbital eccentricity is difficult to measure in BBH systems due to gravitational wave damping, leaving its initial value poorly constrained. The authors aim to recover this parameter by connecting it to spin-orbit misalignment, a measurable quantity tied to natal kicks during binary evolution.

Method: The method links the natal kick's effect on both spin-tilt and post-supernova eccentricity. By analyzing gravitational wave measurements of spin-misalignment, the authors derive constraints on the natal kick strength and reconstruct the binary's formation eccentricity. Applied to GW190412 and GW241011 under an isolated formation scenario.

Result: Demonstrates that formation eccentricity can be estimated using spin-tilt measurements alone. Future detector improvements (e.g., LISA, XG) will refine these estimates, enabling recovery of orbital separation and redshift at formation.

Conclusion: Spin-tilt measurements provide a viable pathway to infer BBH formation eccentricity and decode binary formation histories. Combining with multiband observations will enhance understanding of BBH birth environments and evolutionary processes.

Abstract: Orbital eccentricity remains one of the least accessible parameters in observations of binary black hole (BBH) systems, largely erased by gravitational radiation long before detection. We introduce a new method to recover this lost parameter by using a more accessible and routinely measurable quantity: spin-orbit misalignment. In isolated binary evolution, a natal kick from the second supernova both tilts the orbital plane and injects orbital eccentricity, forging a direct and quantifiable connection between spin-tilt and post-supernova eccentricity. By measuring this spin-tilt using gravitational waves, we can not only constrain the natal kick, but we can also reconstruct the binary's formation eccentricity. We apply this method to GW190412 and GW241011, assuming an isolated formation channel, and show how their eccentricity at formation can be constrained even in the absence of direct eccentricity measurements. As more advanced detectors come online, improved signal-to-noise ratios will tighten spin-tilt constraints, allowing more precise and reliable estimates of BBH formation eccentricity. Combining this method with multiband observations from LISA and next-generation (XG) detectors will allow us to recover not only eccentricity but also the binary's orbital separation and redshift at formation, offering a clearer picture of the birth environments of BBH systems and processes that drive their merger.

### [55] [Radio Supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22117)
*Esha Kundu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This review paper explores how radio observations of supernovae (SNe) can reveal the mass-loss history of progenitor stars and their circumstellar interactions, using radio emissions from ejecta-circumstellar medium interactions. It evaluates core-collapse SNe and thermonuclear SNe, discusses current and future radio facilities, and aims to improve understanding of progenitor stars and explosion mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to map the connection between SN explosions and their progenitor stars by analyzing the circumstellar medium via radio observations, as current knowledge of stellar evolution and explosion mechanisms is limited. Radio studies provide a unique probe of progenitor mass-loss histories over timescales from years to millennia.

Method: The paper reviews radio properties of different SN types (core-collapse and thermonuclear), analyzes their circumstellar interactions, and evaluates data from existing/future radio facilities to infer progenitor mass-loss evolution and stellar characteristics.

Result: Radio observations successfully trace progenitor mass loss histories up to thousands of years prior to explosion. This reveals key details about explosion mechanisms and progenitor star environments, with next-gen radio facilities promising even finer insights into SN physics.

Conclusion: Radio studies are critical for understanding SN progenitors and explosion dynamics. Future radio instruments will enhance ability to map circumstellar media, improving explosion models and revealing previously unknown aspects of stellar evolution leading to SNe.

Abstract: Supernovae (SNe), the catastrophic end of stars' lives, are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe. Mapping the aftermath of the explosions to the properties of pre-SN stars is challenging due to the lack of knowledge about the evolution of different types of stars. The immediate surroundings of pre-SN stars carry the signature of the progenitors, and radio observations are the best way to examine the ambient media. Since radio emission originates from the interaction of supersonic SN ejecta with the relatively stationary circumstellar medium, with a few years of radio study, the mass-loss history of progenitor stars can be probed from just before the explosion of the star to thousands of years before the onset of the SN. Moreover, this can provide crucial details about the explosions, which are poorly understood to date. In this paper, we review the radio properties of different types of core-collapse explosions and thermonuclear runaways to understand their mass-loss evolution--which allows us to unravel the imprints of the progenitors on the surrounding media and thus the nature of the exploded stars. Additionally, we discuss the current state of the art in this field, including existing and the next-generation radio facilities with enhanced capabilities that provide further details about these explosions.
