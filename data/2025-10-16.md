### [1] [Unified kinetic theory of induced scattering: Compton, Brillouin, and Raman processes in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12869)
*Rei Nishiura,Shoma F. Kamijima,Kunihito Ioka*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified theoretical framework for induced scattering instabilities in strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasmas, analyzing various instabilities like induced Compton, Brillouin, and Raman scattering. It derives analytical growth rates for density fluctuations and examines how magnetic fields influence scattering processes, showing SRS becomes possible in charged modes under certain conditions. Applications include modeling astrophysical phenomena like FRBs in magnetars.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify existing theories of plasma instabilities in magnetized pair plasmas, clarify dominant scattering mechanisms under different conditions, and enable evaluations for extreme environments like magnetars.

Method: Solved kinetic theory-based dispersion relations considering ponderomotive forces from wave-beating. Derived analytical expressions for linear growth rates of ordinary, neutral, and charged modes.

Result: Found that perpendicular wave scattering is suppressed in strong magnetic fields, varying by cyclotron frequency powers. SRS becomes possible in charged modes where it's forbidden in unmagnetized plasmas. Established conditions determining dominant instabilities.

Conclusion: Unified framework provides a comprehensive tool for studying induced scattering in extreme plasmas, aiding understanding of phenomena like FRBs. Results stress the role of magnetic fields in enabling novel scattering processes.

Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for induced (stimulated)
scattering-parametric instabilities of electromagnetic waves, including induced
Compton, stimulated Brillouin, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in
strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasma. By solving the dispersion
relations derived from kinetic theory, taking into account the ponderomotive
force due to the beat of incident and scattered waves, we obtain analytical
expressions for the linear growth rates of the ordinary, neutral, and charged
modes of density fluctuations. Our results clarify which type of scattering
dominates under different thermal coupling, resonance, and density conditions.
In strong magnetic fields, scattering of perpendicularly polarized waves is
generally suppressed, but by different powers of the cyclotron frequency.
Moreover, SRS, which is forbidden in unmagnetized electron and positron pair
plasma, becomes possible in the charged mode. This framework enables a
comprehensive evaluation of induced scattering in extreme astrophysical and
laboratory plasma, such as fast radio burst (FRB) emission and propagation in
magnetar magnetospheres.

### [2] [Mean Motion Resonances in AGN Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12895)
*Marguerite Epstein-Martin,Nicholas Stone,Juliette Becker*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the stability of mean motion resonances (MMRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks for binary stellar-mass black holes (BHs), identifying three mass regimes where MMR behavior varies. High-mass AGN (≥10^7.5 M☉) exhibit unstable resonances, low-mass AGN (≤10^6.5 M☉) always have stable MMRs, while intermediate masses show dependence on disk parameters. Stable MMRs could alter BH merger pathways, with high-mass systems allowing direct mergers without resonant chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMRs are common in planetary systems but less explored for BH binaries in AGN disks. The study aims to establish criteria for MMR stability in these systems, considering relativistic effects, disk turbulence, and stellar perturbations, to better understand BH merger dynamics in AGN environments.

Method: The authors derive analytic stability criteria for BH pairs in MMRs under convergent migration. They analyze AGN parameter space, incorporating effects like general-relativistic apsidal precession, hydrodynamic turbulence, and stellar stirring. They categorize BH pair stability into three mass regimes based on these factors.

Result: Three distinct mass regimes are identified: (1) For M ≥10^7.5 M☉, first-order MMRs are unstable. (2) For M ≤10^6.5 M☉, stable MMRs are guaranteed. (3) Intermediate masses (10^6.5–10^7.5 M☉) show variable stability depending on disk mass flux, orbiter mass sum, and nuclear-cusp slope. Stable MMRs often form between inner and outer traps due to thermal torque-driven outward migration.

Conclusion: High-mass AGN BHs likely merge directly without resonant chains, while low/intermediate mass AGN may experience MMRs that alter merger paths. This has implications for observing BH binaries and merger rates in different AGN environments.

Abstract: Mean motion resonances (MMRs) are a generic outcome of convergent migration
for bodies embedded in accretion disks around a central mass. Long studied in
planetary systems, the same phenomenon should occur for stellar-mass black
holes (BHs) in AGN disks. In this work, we derive simple analytic criteria
describing when BH pairs are driven out of resonance, and use them to chart MMR
stability across AGN parameter space, accounting for disruption from
general-relativistic apsidal precession, hydrodynamic turbulence, and stellar
stirring. Across plausible AGN disk models, we find three MBH mass regimes: (i)
for $M/ M_\odot\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$, first order resonances are generically
unstable; (ii) for $M/ M_\odot\lesssim 10^{6.5}$, stable MMRs are always
present; (iii) for $10^{6.5}\lesssim M / M_\odot \lesssim 10^{7.5}$, stability
depends on disk mass flux, the summed mass of the orbiters, and the
nuclear-cusp slope. When present, stable MMRs commonly occur between an inner
anti-trap and an outer trap set by thermal torque, a region where embedded
objects migrate outward in the disk. These results imply that high-mass AGN
allow convergent migration to proceed to LVK-band mergers largely without
resonant chains, whereas low/intermediate-mass AGN can host MMRs, with the
potential to reshape merger pathways.

### [3] [Strategy for identifying Vera C. Rubin Observatory kilonova candidates for targeted gravitational-wave searches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12932)
*Simon Stevenson,Anais Möller,Jade Powell*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores strategies using the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to detect kilonovae and trigger gravitational-wave searches, anticipating ~4 detectable events yearly, with challenges in contamination from other transients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Following GW170817/AT2017gfo, the study aims to optimize kilonova detection via Rubin's observations to enhance multi-messenger astronomy, leveraging both directed searches and routine surveys.

Method: Simulated kilonova light-curves under Rubin's observing strategies (Wide-Fast-Deep, Deep Drilling Fields), using ZTF data to estimate contamination from non-kilonova events.

Result: Estimates ~4 annual kilonova detections with SNR>5 within 350 Mpc, mostly faint and detected 1-2 days post-merger; contamination of ~30 monthly events under strict criteria.

Conclusion: Rubin's data can enable novel gravitational-wave triggers, requiring stringent selection and follow-up with large telescopes to achieve next multi-messenger discoveries.

Abstract: Since the observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and the
associated kilonova AT2017gfo, the next joint gravitational-wave/optical
kilonova has been highly anticipated. Overlapping observations between the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network
are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual
roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart
searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), providing opportunities for fortuitous
kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a
strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by
the Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a
targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the
first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep
and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc$^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$, we find that Rubin brokers should observe $\sim 4$ kilonovae per
year with at least one alert above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within the
gravitational-wave detector horizon ($\sim 350$ Mpc). Most of these will be
faint, and detected 1-2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and
spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival
data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection
criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month
from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection
criteria. A deep gravitational-wave search targeting Rubin kilonova candidates
may lead to the next multi-messenger discovery.

Abstract: The interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with magnetic fields and the interstelar
medium (ISM) leads to the production of nonthermal radiation. Although this has
been a topic of study for many years, it still poses many challenges to the
understanding of these processes. In this work we present a short review of
recent advances in the understanding of CR propagation in magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) turbulence, in particular the process of mirror diffusion, and how it can
help explain recent observational constraints for CR diffusion away from
sources. We also present preliminary results from Monte Carlo simulations of CR
cascading and propagation within a young massive stellar cluster (YMSC), aimed
at probing the origin of very-high-energy (VHE) emission from these sources.

### [5] [Galactic X-ray Transients in the First eROSITA All Sky Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12982)
*Vikash Maan,Aman Katira,Kunal. P. Mooley*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: A study identifies 738 Galactic X-ray transients using ROSAT, eROSITA, and Gaia data, revealing two distinct flaring system types and highlighting higher X-ray luminosities in systems with giant stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work focused on targeted observations of Galactic X-ray transients, but blind surveys and population studies were scarce. The lack of comprehensive data hindered understanding of transient populations and their properties across the Galaxy.

Method: The authors combined ROSAT, eROSITA, and Gaia source catalogs to identify transients with activity timescales <30 years. They analyzed X-ray spectra (focusing on eROSITA's soft X-ray data) to classify systems into thermal (1 keV peak) and non-thermal (below 0.2 keV with power-law component) categories. They also compared X-ray luminosities between systems involving giant stars versus main-seq/YSOs.

Result: 738 transients detected, majority being active stars/interacting binaries. Among these, ~40 are compact object systems including 8 new white dwarf systems, 3 known XRBs, 1 pulsar. Two spectral types identified. Giant star systems show significantly higher X-ray luminosities. Estimated transient fractions and detection rates for blind X-ray surveys proposed.

Conclusion: Blind X-ray surveys provide critical population statistics and transient mechanisms insights. The发现 of distinct spectral classes and luminosity differences underscores diverse astrophysical processes. Future missions like eROSITA's all-sky scans will significantly enhance transient detection rates and understanding of Galactic X-ray populations.

Abstract: Although a multitude of studies have focused on targeted observations of
Galactic X-ray transients, blind surveys and population studies have been
limited. We have used the ROSAT, eROSITA and Gaia source catalogs to find
Galactic X-ray transients having timescales $<$30 years. We report the
properties of 738 transients found in our search, majority of which are active
stars or interacting binaries. We have also found $\sim$40 compact object
systems among which are at least 8 newly-identified white-dwarf systems, 3
known X-ray binaries, and one known pulsar. We use eROSITA (soft X-ray) spectra
of the Galactic transients to show that two distinct types of flaring systems
are prevalent: one having peak around 1 keV, well fit by thermal models, and
another having peak below 0.2 keV and requiring a power-law component. Our
study also reveals that single star or interacting binary systems (X-ray
transients) involving giant stars exhibit significantly higher X-ray
luminosities than systems involving only main-sequence stars or young stellar
objects. Finally, we discuss the properties of the transients in the context of
their putative emission mechanisms, the fraction of transients with respect to
the total population, and the rates of Galactic transients expected in blind
searches of the X-ray sky.

### [6] [Exploring the connection between compact object mergers and fast X-ray transients: The cases of LXT 240402A & EP250207b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13015)

Lysenko,Margarita Pereyra Talamantes,Anna Ridnaia,Rubén Sánchez-Ramírez,Hui Sun,Dmitry Svinkin,Mikhail Ulanov,R. Woolf,Bing Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper investigates two fast X-ray transients (LXT 240402A and EP 250207b) linked to nearby galaxies, suggesting they may originate from compact object mergers. Observations with Chandra, VLT, GTC, LBT, Swift, and Einstein Probe support merger-driven explosions with low-mass ejecta but cannot rule out distant supernova alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a connection between compact object mergers and extragalactic FXRTs, which has been hypothesized but not confirmed.

Method: Used Chandra for precise localization, VLT/GTC/LBT for optical/near-infrared observations to search for kilonova and analyze environments, and Swift/Einstein Probe for X-ray monitoring to study afterglows.

Result: Both FXRTs are consistent with merger origins but lack definitive kilonova detection; alternative scenarios like high-redshift supernovae remain possible.

Conclusion: The events are plausible merger candidates, but further observations are needed to conclusively distinguish between merger-driven explosions and distant supernova explanations.

Abstract: The connection between compact object mergers and some extragalactic fast
X-ray transients (FXRTs) has long been hypothesized, but never ultimately
established. In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient
LXT\,240402A and the Einstein Probe EP\,250207b, whose precise positions lie
close to nearby ($z\!\lesssim\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible
probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising
cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to
derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous
associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared
observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the
surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of
neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and
Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that
both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which
produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow.
However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\!\gtrsim\!1$)
core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are
expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA)
frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact
binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of
residual eccentricity at $10$~Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a
significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple
systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and
the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The
latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through
$2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with
small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code
with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different
families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude
librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to
construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the
instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in
\texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform
phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The
orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary
perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the
same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different
orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 50$
binaries can have librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.

*Evgeni Grishin,Isobel M. Romero-Shaw,Alessandro A. Trani*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates eccentric gravitational-wave mergers detectable by LISA, identifying four orbital families through N-body simulations and proposing a waveform analysis method to distinguish these families and infer tertiary companion properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origins of eccentric mergers and differentiate between dynamical/triple system origins versus galactic dynamics, enabling mass measurements and classification.

Method: Using the TSUNAMI N-body code with 3.5PN corrections, the study simulates four orbital families (circulating, small/librating, large/librating, merging). Waveforms are generated via the quadrupole formula from simulation data to analyze distinguishable features.

Result: The four orbital families exhibit distinct waveform characteristics, allowing potential differentiation via LISA observations. Tertiary companion properties can be inferred, providing independent mass estimates and distinguishing different formation channels.

Conclusion: Gravitational-wave observations with LISA can reveal orbital family signatures, offering insights into binary formation mechanisms and enabling tests of triple system dynamics.

Abstract: A significant fraction of gravitational-wave mergers are expected to be
eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency band,
$10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ Hz. Several LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events show potential hints of
residual eccentricity at 10 Hz, pointing to dynamical or triple origins for
part of the population, where von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations can perturb
both the eccentricity and the inclination of the binary. Moreover, the argument
of pericentre, $\omega$ could be fully circulating, or librating, with a
limited range for $\omega$. We use TSUNAMI, a regularised N-body code with
3.5PN corrections to identify four different orbital families: (i) circulating,
(ii) small-amplitude and (iii) large-amplitude librating, and (iv) merging. We
develop a new method to construct gravitational-wave waveforms using the
quadrupole formula from the instantaneous acceleration in TSUNAMI. The four
orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be
distinguished if observed in LISA. In particular, the properties of the
tertiary companion can be inferred and serve as an independent mass measurement
and distinguish field triple dynamics from galactic dynamics.

### [9] [Some problems associated with the standardization of the light curve of type 1a supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13187)
*A. P. Mahtessian,G. S. Karapetian,H. F. Khachatryan,M. A. Hovhannisyan,L. A. Mahtessian,L. E. Byzalov,J. M. Sarkissian*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper argues that the SALT2 and SiFTO models, used to standardize Type 1a supernovae luminosities, introduce redshift-dependent biases. This bias artificially inflates their absolute magnitudes, leading to overestimated distances, which historically supported dark energy. The authors assert that Type 1a supernovae are no longer reliable standard candles under these models, questioning the evidence for cosmic acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reevaluate the reliability of Type 1a supernovae as standard candles in cosmological models, specifically addressing potential systematic errors introduced by fitting methods like SALT2 and SiFTO. The motivation arises from concerns that redshift dependencies in these models may have tainted conclusions about dark energy and cosmic acceleration.

Method: The authors analyze how the SALT2 and SiFTO standardization parameters are influenced by redshift. They demonstrate that increasing redshift leads to higher standardized absolute magnitudes, causing empirical distance estimates to be too large. This was likely done through statistical analysis of observational data, comparing model outputs with theoretical expectations, and evaluating systematic effects.

Result: The key results are: 1) Standardization parameters in SALT2/SiFTO depend significantly on redshift. 2) This leads to systematically larger inferred distances for high-redshift supernovae. 3) Consequently, Type 1a supernovae post-standardization fail as true standard candles. 4) The apparent acceleration of the universe's expansion (attributed to dark energy) may be an artifact of this systematic bias.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current standardization methods (SALT2/SiFTO) are flawed for distance measurement purposes, particularly in high-redshift regimes. Therefore, the evidential basis supporting an accelerating universe and dark energy's existence requires re-examination in light of these systematic uncertainties.

Abstract: We show that the parameters used to standardize the luminosity of Type 1a
supernovae in the SALT2 and SiFTO models are strongly dependent on the redshift
z. Consequently, when standardized with increasing z, the average absolute
magnitudes of Type 1a supernovae are artificially increased. This means that
for a given apparent magnitude they are, on average, assigned larger distances
than they actually are, creating the appearance of their recession with
acceleration and requiring the introduction of the concept of antigravity (dark
energy) to explain it. We also show that after standardization, Type 1a
supernovae cease to be standard candles. We therefore argue that such a
standardization is not suitable for measuring the distances to Type 1a
supernovae, and hence the accelerating expansion of the Universe is called into
question.

### [10] [Monte Carlo simulation of the Compton scattering and disk reflection of a cylinder with hot electrons moving away from a black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13249)
*Wei Meng,Yuan You,Shuang-Nan Zhang,Jia-Ying Cao*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cylindrical jet-based model to address limitations of the traditional lamp-post scenario for accreting black holes. By simulating Compton scattering in a relativistic jet environment, they show that jets can suppress disk reflection while still producing dominant hard X-ray spectra, explaining observations like those from Swift J1727.8-1613.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lamp-post model fails to explain seed photon origins and corona geometry since it simplifies the corona as a point source. This study aims to provide a physically realistic alternative using a cylindrical jet structure and disk multicolor blackbody seed photons.

Method: Monte Carlo simulations with Geant4 for Compton scattering in a relativistic jet, combined with XSPEC's xilconv for disk reflection. The jet's cylindrical geometry and relativistic motion effects are modeled to analyze their impact on X-ray spectra.

Result: Relativistic jets weaken/suppress disk reflection but still contribute prominently to high-energy X-ray spectra via Comptonization. This aligns with observations of weak reflection in Swift J1727.8-1613 despite strong hard X-ray emission.

Conclusion: Cylindrical jet models offer a viable alternative to the lamp-post scenario, resolving its geometric and seed photon shortcomings. The findings help explain observational puzzles involving suppressed reflections and dominant hard X-ray emissions from accreting BH systems.

Abstract: For accreting black holes (BHs), the lamp-post scenario is a simple and
popular model: a hot and point-like corona is located above the black hole,
irradiating the accretion disk with hard X-ray radiation, which is believed to
be generated by inverse Compton scattering in the corona. Although the
lamp-post model successfully explains the disk reflection component, it fails
to address the origin of seed photons and the geometry of the hot corona,
because this model simplistically treats the corona as a point-like source
generating a cutoff powerlaw spectrum. In this paper, we make simulations on a
possible physical realization of the lamp-post scenario: the shape of the
scattering zone is set to be a cylinder, corresponding to the jet base near a
BH. The source of seed photons in this system is assumed to be the multicolor
blackbody radiation of the accretion disk. In our simulations, the Compton
scattering process is simulated with a custom Monte Carlo program based on the
Geant4 package and the disk reflection process is simulated with the xilconv
model in XSPEC. Our simulation results have confirmed that the relativistic
motion of the jet can weaken or even completely suppress the reflection of the
accretion disk, and simultaneously, the Comptonization of disk photons in the
jet can still make a major contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum in high
energy range. We discuss the implications of our simulation results, in light
of the recent observations of a very weak reflection component in the presence
of a strong hard X-ray radiation from the outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extended RELXILL model allowing for a radially extended ring-like corona around black holes, improving constraints on coronal structure and showing that compact coronae close to the ISCO can explain observations as well as point-like models. Applied to ESO 033-G002 data, it constrains corona distance to <3 gravitational radii.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of the lamp-post model which cannot constrain coronal radial size and better understand X-ray reflection features caused by accretion disk geometry and corona properties.

Method: Extended the RELXILL model to include a radially extended ring-like corona source, simulating spectra and fitting XMM-Newton/NuSTAR data of ESO 033-G002. Compared results with traditional lamp-post model.

Result: New model successfully fits data, constrains corona distance <3 gravitational radii but poor angular constraints. Shows radially extended coronae near ISCO can explain reflections as effectively as point sources.

Conclusion: Radially extended coronae models are necessary for constraining corona structure, offering better physical realism. The model provides new insights into coronal geometry and will aid future relativistic spectral analysis.

Abstract: Reflection of X-rays at the inner accretion disk around black holes imprints
relativistically broadened features in the observed spectrum. Besides the black
hole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk the
features also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of
X-rays, often called the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model
for spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the
accretion disk. A commonly used model to explain observed X-ray reflection
spectra is the lamp post, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational
axis of the black hole. While often being able to explain the observations,
this geometric model does not allow for a constraint on the radial size of the
corona. We therefore extend the publicly available relativistic reflection
model RELXILL by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source.
With the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary
source in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and
discuss implications of data fitting compared to the lamp post model. We then
apply this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the
radio-quiet Seyfert-2 AGN ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well,
and we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be
less than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source
is poorly constrained. We show that a compact, radially extended corona close
to the ISCO can explain the observed relativistic reflection equally well as
the point-like lamp post corona. The model is made freely available to the
community.

TL;DR: The study confirms NGC 1068 as the most significant neutrino source in the northern sky, showing its neutrino flux exceeds gamma-rays by two orders of magnitude. By analyzing 47 X-ray bright Seyferts, a 3.3σ excess from 11 sources (excluding NGC 1068) suggests X-ray bright AGN cores are neutrino emitters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disparity between neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes from NGC 1068 and explore if X-ray luminous Seyferts (not previously gamma-ray listed) emit neutrinos.

Method: Analyzed 13.1 years of IceCube data for northern sky neutrino sources, testing 110 preselected gamma-ray sources and an additional 47 X-ray bright Seyferts from Swift/BAT survey.

Result: NGC 1068 remains most significant; its neutrino spectrum follows a power-law (γ=3.4±0.2) with flux 100× higher than gamma-rays. A 3.3σ excess found in 11 X-ray sources (excluding NGC 1068).

Conclusion: X-ray bright cores of active galactic nuclei are likely neutrino emitters, strengthening the link between AGN activity and high-energy neutrino production.

Abstract: Recently, IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC
1068. Using 13.1 years of IceCube data, we present a follow-up search for
neutrino sources in the northern sky. NGC 1068 remains the most significant
neutrino source among 110 preselected gamma-ray emitters while also being
spatially compatible with the most significant location in the northern sky.
Its energy spectrum is characterized by an unbroken power-law with spectral
index $\gamma = 3.4 \pm 0.2$. Consistent with previous results, the observed
neutrino flux exceeds its gamma-ray counterpart by at least two orders of
magnitude. Motivated by this disparity and the high X-ray luminosity of the
source, we selected 47 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies from the Swift/BAT
spectroscopic survey that were not included in the list of gamma-ray emitters.
When testing this collection for neutrino emission, we observe a 3.3$\sigma$
excess from an ensemble of 11 sources, with NGC 1068 excluded from the sample.
Our results strengthen the evidence that X-ray bright cores of active galactic
nuclei are neutrino emitters.

### [13] [The Formation Rate and Luminosity Function of Fast X-ray transients from Einstein probe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13533)
*Yizhou Guo,Houdun Zeng,Junjie Wei,Hao Zhou,Zhiping Jin,Xuefeng Wu,Daming Wei*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The Einstein Probe (EP) telescope detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), and a non-parametric model-independent analysis was used to determine their luminosity function and formation rate. Significant luminosity evolution was found, with a luminosity break at ~4.17×10⁴⁶ erg/s and a formation rate comparable to low-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts, suggesting a potential link between FXTs and collapsar progenitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical origins of FXTs by determining their luminosity function and formation rate, which are crucial for elucidating their nature.

Method: A model-independent, non-parametric approach was applied to the EP-detected FXT catalog to derive luminosity functions and formation rates without assuming specific parametric forms.

Result: The analysis showed significant cosmological luminosity evolution scaling with (1+z)^3.58. The local luminosity function follows a broken power law with a break at 4.17×10^46 erg/s. The formation rate declines gently as (1+z)^-0.21, yielding a local rate of ~28.0 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹, similar to low-luminosity GRBs.

Conclusion: FXTs may be linked to collapsar progenitors given their formation rate similarity to low-luminosity long GRBs, suggesting a shared astrophysical origin.

Abstract: Following its launch on January 9, 2024, the Einstein Probe (EP) telescope
has detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), yet their physical
origins remain elusive. Understanding their luminosity function and formation
rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Based on the latest catalog of
EP-detected FXTs, we present, a model-independent, non-parametric approach to
derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals
significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling
relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we
establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken
power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s.
The formation rate exhibits a gentle decline with redshift, following the
relation $(1+z)^{-0.21}$, yielding a local rate of approximately
$28.0_{-16.4}^{+27.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is comparable to that of
low-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate a potential
correlation between FXTs and LGRBs, supporting the majority of FXTs may be
linked to collapsar progenitors.

### [14] [Optimizing Supernova Classification with Interpretable Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13765)
*Anurag Garg*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient and interpretable XGBoost-based framework for photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae, achieving high performance on imbalanced datasets using PR-AUC and F1-score metrics. The method outperforms deep learning models in precision-recall trade-offs while requiring fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is the challenge of accurately classifying Type Ia supernovae in the face of class imbalance and observational noise, coupled with the need for a model that is both computationally efficient and interpretable, especially for large-scale surveys like LSST.

Method: The method involves using an XGBoost ensemble model optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning to classify light curves from the SPCC dataset. The authors emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as evaluation metrics over ROC-AUC in imbalanced scenarios.

Result: The model achieved a PR-AUC of 0.993, an F1-score of 0.923, and a ROC-AUC of 0.976, demonstrating superior performance in precision-recall trade-offs compared to deep learning models while using fewer resources.

Conclusion: The study concludes that optimized ensemble models like XGBoost provide a viable, efficient, and transparent alternative to deep learning architectures for SN Ia classification, particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments and large surveys such as LSST.

Abstract: Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for
cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and
observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are
often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a
computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that
maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of
PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely
imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian
hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova
Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a
3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of
$0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of
$0.976 \pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on
precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower
overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives,
improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized
ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex
architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the Type-I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts and
eclipses observed from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) EXO
0748--676 with AstroSat during the second known outburst of the source
following a 16-year-long quiescence period. We detect three thermonuclear X-ray
bursts, with two displaying simultaneous coverage in the soft X-rays.
Simultaneous UV observations show evidence of reprocessed burst emissions in
the far-ultraviolet band. The time-resolved spectral analysis reveals the
photospheric radius expansion (PRE) nature for two bursts. We estimate the
distance to the source to be $7.42\pm0.53$ kpc using the peak flux of PRE.
Notably, one of the bursts exhibited a secondary peak, $\sim30$ s after the
primary, particularly dominating in the softer X-rays, which reveals a
correlation with the evolution of burst hotspot radius with no temperature
dependence. The burst properties and corresponding flux values suggest that
mixed H/He burning may have fueled the bursts. We also detect evidence of a
soft excess during one burst, likely arising from the interaction of the burst
photons with the surroundings. We uncover evidence for a hard X-ray deficit
during the peak of all bursts and a hard lag of $\sim4$ s, which can be
attributed to the Compton cooling of the corona by the burst photons. We also
probe the temporal evolution and the energy dependence of the eclipses, which
offer insights into the binary environment. Our study helps gain deeper insight
into the physics of burst ignition, flame propagation, the burst-accretion
interaction, and the evolution of LMXBs.

*Franciele M. da Silva,Adamu Issifu,Luis C. N. Santos,Tobias Frederico,Débora P. Menezes*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores how the structure and rotation of protoneutron stars influence their observable properties and internal dynamics using a relativistic model that considers temperature, particle composition, and exotic matter effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the link between microphysics and global evolution of protoneutron stars, and to constrain the equation of state (EoS) for better modeling in multi-messenger astrophysics.

Method: Employing a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings accounting for temperature and composition, the study analyzes rotation, angular momentum changes due to neutrino emission, particle distributions, temperature, sound speed, energy distribution, and gravitational mass evolution.

Result: Protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution depend on angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons, Δ-resonances) and rapid rotation increase deformation, lowering core temperatures. Slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740+6620 remain nearly spherical. Predicted equatorial radii for this star align with NICER data.

Conclusion: Accurate modeling of protoneutron stars requires integrating rotation, compression, and composition effects. The findings provide constraints for the EoS and improve predictions in multi-messenger astrophysics.

Abstract: The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential
information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties
provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using
a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account
for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation,
neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions,
temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of
protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic
quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish
direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework
of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of
rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star
deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and
composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances) and rapid
rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature,
whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical.
Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} < R_e <
13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings
constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation,
mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model
protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.

### [17] [Solar Cycle Variation of Sustained Gamma-ray Emission Events from the Sun and Related Energetic Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13610)
*N. Gopalswamy,P. Mäkela,S. Akiyama,S. Yashiro,H. Xie*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the solar cycle variations of sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) events during SCs 24 and 25 using Fermi/LAT data, noting a significant decline in observed SGREs in SC 25 despite similar solar activity levels. Instrumental limitations (Fermi's reduced Sun coverage after 2018) suggest an undercount, with actual SGREs being ~3x higher than observed 15 events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why the number of SGRE events decreased in SC 25 compared to SC 24 despite comparable solar activity indicators (SEPs, GLEs, CMEs). The study aims to assess whether this reflects true astrophysical changes or observational biases.

Method: Analysis of Fermi/LAT SGRE observations during SCs 24 (2011-2020) and 25 (2021-present). Correlation of SGREs with SEP events, interplanetary type II radio bursts, and fast/wide CMEs. Accounting for reduced Fermi's solar coverage since 2018 due to solar array issues to estimate correction factor for SGRE counts.

Result: Observed SGRE events in SC25 are ~50% fewer than SC24. Correcting for observational gaps suggests SC25 had ~45 total SGRE events (vs observed 15), indicating no real decline but consistent activity with SC24.

Conclusion: The apparent decrease in SGREs is attributed to Fermi's instrumentation limitations rather than solar activity changes. True SGRE rates in SC25 mirror SC24 levels, aligning with other solar activity metrics (SEPs, CMEs). Future observations with full coverage are needed to confirm trends.

Abstract: The sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is one of the
fascinating high energy phenomena closely related to the acceleration of
protons to energies >300 MeV. Here we report on the solar cycle variation of
SGRE events based on observations from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). This
report covers solar cycles (SCs) 24 and 25 during which Fermi has been
operating. Since SGRE events are closely related to solar energetic particle
(SEP) events and interplanetary type II radio bursts caused by fast and wide
coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we consider these phenomena as well. Many
studies have shown that SC 25 is similar or slightly stronger than SC 24. The
number of SEP events, GLE events, IP type II bursts, and fast and wide CMEs
confirm this conclusion. However, the number of SGRE events observed by Fermi
LAT has diminished significantly in SC 25 relative to SC 24. One of the issues
has been the reduced coverage of the Sun since 2018 due to a mechanical problem
with a solar array of the Fermi mission. By identifying the Fermi LAT gaps and
the number of energetic events (fast and wide CMEs, interplanetary type II
bursts) we conclude that about three times more SGRE events must have occurred
than the 15 events observed by Fermi.

### [18] [XRISM Resolves Relativistic Effects from the Innermost Accretion Disk in Serpens X-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13739)
*R. M. Ludlam,J. M. Miller,E. M Cackett,J. A. Garcia*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The first XRISM/Resolve observation of Serpens X-1 reveals a neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary with a spectrally soft state. The Fe emission line exhibits a dual-peaked structure and red wing, consistent with relativistic reflection models indicating a disk near the neutron star's innermost stable orbit and a low inclination angle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the high-resolution XRISM data to understand the accretion disk geometry and relativistic effects around a neutron star.

Method: Observed Serpens X-1 for 350 ks using XRISM/Resolve, analyzed time-averaged and variable spectra, applied relxillNS reflection model to interpret Fe line profiles.

Result: Detected dual-peaked Fe line with red wing, confirmed inner disk radius at ~1.02 ISCO, and low inclination angle (5°±1°), validating relativistic reflection models over alternatives.

Conclusion: XRISM's resolution enables precise accretion disk studies, confirming disk proximity to the neutron star and supporting prior inclination estimates through relativistic reflection modeling.

Abstract: We present the first XRISM/Resolve observation of the persistently accreting
neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1. The source was observed on
October 17th, 2024, for approximately 350 ks of elapsed time, resulting in 171
ks of exposure. The source exhibited 22% variability with respect to the
average count rate of 73.1 count/s during the observation, but remained in a
spectrally soft state throughout. The time averaged spectrum was analyzed in
conjunction with spectra extracted from periods of different count rate to
check for variations in spectral components. The unprecedented energy
resolution of 4.5 eV at 6 keV of XRISM/Resolve provides a detailed look at the
shape and structure of the Fe emission line within the data, which shows a
dual-peaked structure with an extended red-wing, and steep decline in the
blue-wing of the line profile. Fits with the reflection model relxillNS are
able to describe the structure in the Fe line region, and confirms previous
results that the disk is close to the NS ($R_{\rm in}$ = $1.02_{-0.01}^{+0.21}\
R_{\rm ISCO}$). These models also measure a low systemic inclination
($i=5^{\circ}\pm1^{\circ}$), confirming prior X-ray and optical studies.
Alternative models were explored to describe the structure of the Fe line
profile, however, relativistic reflection provides the simplest and
statistically best explanation of the data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A long-lived central engine embedded in expanding supernova ejecta can alter
the dynamics and observational signatures of the event, producing an unusually
luminous, energetic, and/or rapidly-evolving transient. We use two-dimensional
hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source,
varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We
post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport
code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the
centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently
powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and
accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of
the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing
high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical
impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon
escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of
low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially
hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic
supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity
material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow
emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how
variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise
to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes,
including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and
superluminous supernovae.

Abstract: The polarization of X-ray synchrotron emission in blazars offers a direct
probe into the magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration processes
operating in relativistic jets. We use particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic
reconnection and magnetized turbulence, coupled to polarization-sensitive
radiative transfer code, to interpret IXPE observations of Mrk 421 during a
high flux state recorded in December of 2023. To evaluate the fitness of the
theoretical scenarios, we rely on a quantitative comparison the statistical
properties of simulated and observed X-ray flux and polarization light curves
using five evaluation metrics, rather than attempting to fit individual data
points. We propose a multi-zone model where jet emission is represented as the
sum of the radiative output of many independent cells, each described by a
simulation run viewed at different orientations. Comparison of ensembles of
simulated Stokes-parameter light curves with IXPE data shows that magnetic
reconnection dominated models provide the best match to the observed X-ray flux
and polarization dynamics. The optimal configuration corresponds to N = 15
emitting cells, which reproduces the observed amplitudes and timescales of the
X-ray flux and polarization variations. Magnetized turbulence models
underpredict both the flux and polarization variability. Our results indicate
that a multi-zone, reconnection-powered emission scenario can describe the
X-ray polarization behavior of Mrk 421 and establish a quantitative framework
for testing theoretical models against IXPE observations of other
high-synchrotron-peaked blazars.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) to detect double-bump showers, a rare type of extensive air shower with distinct double-peaked longitudinal profiles caused by high-energy secondary particles. The authors developed a method using the Akaike information criterion to identify these showers in simulations, analyzed their prevalence across different cosmic ray particles and interaction models, and demonstrated how SKAO's capabilities can enable their detailed observation through radio footprint analysis.

Motivation: To detect and study the rare double-bump showers, which can provide new insights into hadronic interactions and high-energy particle cross sections. Existing experiments have failed to directly observe these showers, necessitating advanced detection methods like those enabled by SKAO.

Method: Simulated EAS using CORSIKA with CoREAS for radio emissions. Developed an Akaike information criterion-based method to identify double-bump showers via longitudinal profiles. Tracked particles with at least 1% of primary energy to form a shower 'skeleton' and analyze leading particles. Investigated shower prevalence across primary particles and interaction models.

Result: Confirmed the feasibility of detecting double-bump showers with SKAO due to its antenna density and frequency range. Showed that radio footprints with multiple Cherenkov rings can reveal longitudinal profiles. Found the method effectively identifies double-bump showers and links leading particle properties to measurable parameters.

Conclusion: SKAO will be the first experiment capable of observing double-bump showers in detail, offering unprecedented opportunities to study hadronic interactions at high energies. The developed methods enable robust detection and analysis, paving the way for future SKAO-based investigations into cosmic ray physics.

Abstract: Double-bump showers are a rare class of extensive air showers (EAS) predicted
by Monte Carlo simulations. They occur when a high-energy secondary particle,
the leading particle, travels significantly farther than the rest, creating a
distinct double-peaked longitudinal profile. So far, no experiment has been
able to directly detect these showers. The unique radio footprint of
double-bump showers, characterized by multiple Cherenkov rings, provides a way
to reconstruct longitudinal profiles from radio observations. With its dense
antenna array and broad frequency range, the Square Kilometer Array Observatory
(SKAO) will be the first experiment capable of detecting these features,
offering a new opportunity to probe hadronic interactions and constrain
particle cross sections at high energies.
  In our analysis, we simulate the EAS using CORSIKA with the CoREAS plugin for
radio. We developed a new method based on the Akaike information criterion to
identify double bump showers in simulations by analyzing their longitudinal
profiles. Then we investigate the prevalence of these double bump showers
across different cosmic ray primary particles and various hadronic interaction
models. We create a skeleton of the EAS which consists of all the particles
with at least $1\%$ of the primary energy, allowing us to confirm the leading
particle hypothesis and track shower development following these particles.
This will enable us to relate the attributes of the leading particle to
measurable parameters. Depending on the exact shower properties, the radio
footprint of a double bump shower can create a complex interference pattern,
consisting of multiple rings. From this information, the longitudinal profiles
can be extracted. SKA due to its dense antenna array and frequency range will
be the first experiment able to observe these double bump showers in detail.

### [22] [Differential topology and micro-structure of black hole in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg spacetimes with exponential entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12855)
*Muhammad Yasir,Tong Lining,Kazuharu Bamba*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates exact black holes in the Einstein Euler-Heisenberg theory using an exponential entropy framework and topological current analysis. Different thermodynamic ensembles (canonical, mixed, grand canonical) are employed to explore topology classes and critical points, revealing distinct behaviors in generation/annihilation points, temperature dependencies, heat capacity, and thermodynamic stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore black hole solutions within the Einstein Euler-Heisenberg framework and analyze their thermodynamic properties across various ensembles to understand stability and topological features.

Method: The study uses the topological current Ψ-mapping theory combined with an exponential entropy approach. Three thermodynamic ensembles (canonical, mixed, grand canonical) were applied to examine topology classes, critical points, and their implications on black hole properties. The magnetic charge and potential were varied systematically across ensembles.

Result: Key findings include differing topological charges per ensemble (1, -1, or none for generation/annihilation points), temperature and heat capacity dependencies on horizon radius indicating stability, and analysis of thermodynamic curvatures via geometric methods.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that ensemble choice significantly affects black hole thermodynamic behavior and stability. The topological analysis provides insights into critical points and phase transitions, emphasizing the role of magnetic parameters and geometric methods in understanding black hole physics within quantum corrected gravity theories.

Abstract: Exact black holes in the Einstein Euler-Heisenberg theory are explored with
an exponential entropy framework by using the topological current
$\Psi$-mapping theory. The topology classes are investigated through the
canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles. In particular, the magnetic
charge is fixed for the canonical ensemble, whereas the magnetic potential is
included for the mixed ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble with
maintaining its consistency through the magnetic potential. The topological
charges are analyzed for each ensemble through critical points. As a result, it
is found that the canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles lead to
either $1$, $-1$, or no generation/annihilation points. Moreover, it is shown
how temperature and heat capacity depend on the horizon radius in order to
verify the stability of a black hole. Furthermore, the behavior of the
thermodynamic curvatures of a black hole is investigated through the geometric
methods.

*S. H. Shekh,Anirudh Pradhan,A. Husain,M. Zeyauddin*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates thermodynamic laws in f(Q,𝕋) gravity at the apparent horizon of a flat FLRW universe, testing various models. It finds that linear and mildly nonlinear models are thermodynamically viable, while strongly nonlinear models need parameter tuning to satisfy the generalized second law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the viability of f(Q,𝕋) gravity models using thermodynamic consistency as a criterion, addressing how modified gravity theories can explain cosmic acceleration.

Method: Thermodynamic analysis of f(Q,𝕋) gravity using the Gibbs relation to evaluate entropy change rates at the apparent horizon, testing linear, power-law, quadratic trace, exponential, and cross-coupling models inspired by f(R,𝕋), f(T), and string theory.

Result: Linear/mildly nonlinear models naturally satisfy the generalized second law (GSL), but strongly nonlinear or interaction-type models require finely tuned parameters for GSL compliance.

Conclusion: Thermodynamic considerations are crucial for evaluating modified gravity models' viability and their role in cosmology.

Abstract: Late-time cosmic acceleration has motivated the exploration of various
extensions of general relativity, among which $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, based
on the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and the trace of the energy--momentum tensor
$\mathcal{T}$, has gained increasing attention. In this study, we explore the
thermodynamic aspects of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity by establishing the first
law and generalized second law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of a
flat FLRW universe. By applying the Gibbs relation, we determined the rate of
change of the total entropy and assessed the conditions under which the
generalized second law remains valid for various choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$.
Our analysis focuses on linear, power-law, quadratic trace, exponential, and
cross-coupling models, inspired by frameworks such as $f(R,\mathcal{T})$,
$f(T)$, and modifications motivated by string theory. Our analysis showed that
linear and mildly nonlinear models are generally thermodynamically consistent,
whereas strongly nonlinear or interaction-type models require fine-tuned
parameters for the generalized second law to hold. The present analysis
underscores that thermodynamic considerations serve as effective criteria for
assessing the viability of modified gravity models and their relevance to
cosmological dynamics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass
and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in
characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars.
Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of
state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron
star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical
approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all
known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given
EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of
the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture
for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking.
However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that
it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the
compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for
the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$.
Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass
and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.

Abstract: These proceedings summarize some recent efforts in understanding a class of
vector-tensor theories known as {\it bumblebee} models, which spontaneously
break local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance. Using cosmological
perturbation theory on an exact dS background, we find that for non-minimal
coupling to gravity, the theory contains a ghost mode unless a degeneracy
condition is imposed, after which the model becomes a subset of generalized
Proca theory. We go further to show that scalar perturbations become strongly
coupled in the minimal-coupling limit, which shows the necessity of the
non-minimal coupling. Moreover, we find a constraint on the bumblebee field
from the speed of tensor modes on the order of $10^{-15}$.

*Wen-Mei Li,Jianbo Lu,Shu-Min Wu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines quantum entropic uncertainty and coherence for GHZ and W states in a fermionic field around a higher-dimensional EGB black hole. It analyzes two scenarios involving quantum memories near the horizon versus the measured particle being near, observing dimensional-dependent behavior and differences in robustness against Hawking radiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how quantum resources like entropic uncertainty and coherence behave in curved spacetime, specifically near a spherically symmetric black hole in EGB gravity, and to determine which quantum states (GHZ vs W) are more robust under Hawking radiation in different spatial configurations.

Method: The paper evaluates tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty and quantum coherence for GHZ and W states in a fermionic field within EGB gravity's black hole background. Two scenarios are analyzed: (i) quantum memories near the horizon with Alice in flat space, and (ii) the reverse. Mathematical analysis of dimensional effects (d≥5) on uncertainty and coherence, considering thermodynamic properties and Hawking radiation impacts.

Result: In d>5 dimensions, uncertainty decreases with horizon radius while coherence increases. In 5D, both show non-monotonic behavior. W states maintain higher coherence, while GHZ states resist uncertainty better. Scenario 1 (memories near horizon) always has lower coherence than Scenario 2. For uncertainty, W shows lower in Scenario1, but GHZ higher.

Conclusion: Different quantum resources (uncertainty vs coherence) exhibit distinct behaviors under spacetime curvature and dimensionality. The choice between GHZ and W states depends on desired quantum resource preservation in relativistic quantum information tasks.

Abstract: We investigate tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertain and
quantum coherence for GHZ and W states of a fermionic field in the background
of a spherically symmetric black hole of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity.
Two distinct scenarios are analyzed: (i) the quantum memories (held by Bob and
Charlie) are near the horizon while the measured particle (Alice) remains in
the flat region, and (ii) the reverse configuration. Dimensional dependence is
observed: in $d>5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases
monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in
$d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive
thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W
state exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state
shows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking
radiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors:
quantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near
horizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of
the quantum state. For measurement uncertainty, the W state displays lower
uncertainty in Scenario 1, while the GHZ state exhibits the opposite trend,
with higher measurement uncertainty in Scenario 1. These results indicate that
the characteristics of different quantum resources provide important insights
into the selection and optimization of quantum states for information
processing in curved spacetime.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The quantum nature of the Schwarzschild black hole interior is investigated
through the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The interior of a static,
spherically symmetric black hole is described by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS)
metric, which represents a homogeneous but anisotropic cosmology. We derive the
Hamiltonian for the gravitational system corresponding to the black hole
interior and obtain the associated WDW equation. By varying the gravitational
constant as a parameter controlling quantum effects, we examine how the
solutions of the WDW equation change with respect to this parameter. In the
parameter regime where quantum effects are negligible, we find that the wave
packet solutions closely follow the classical trajectory of the black hole
interior. On the other hand, as quantum effects are enhanced, the wave packet
deviates from the classical trajectory and exhibits behavior suggestive of
singularity avoidance. To quantify this behavior, we introduce an appropriate
"clock" inside the black hole and compute the time to singularity formation
with respect to this clock. The results show that stronger quantum effects lead
to a longer formation time, suggesting a tendency toward the avoidance of
singularity formation due to quantum gravity effects.

Abstract: In massless scalar field cosmology, imposing the universe's physical volume
as fundamentally discrete resolves the big bang singularity via a big bounce.
We use quantum field theory on curved background to numerically track the
number of particles created in the vacuum of a quantum field that propagates
through the cosmological bounce. We find that due to geometry's evolution,
particle production in all modes initially rises, sharply peaks at the bounce,
and varies slowly afterwards. Further, by comparing with the case of a quantum
field propagating on an expanding universe, we discover that the bouncing
universe's imprints on quantum matter are distinct: notably, the late time
particle production across modes resembles a thermal spectrum. We then use
semiclassical gravity and find similar qualitative results. Here, we also
determine how particle production affects geometry's evolution. Our study adds
to existing literature on gravity-matter interactions in the context of a
bouncing universe, contributes to searches of a bouncing universe's signatures,
and strengthens the link between gravity and thermodynamics.

*R. H. Ali,Zi-Yu Tang,Xiao-Mei Kuang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the phase structure of a nonminimally coupled magnetic AdS black hole by linking thermodynamics and particle dynamics. It identifies Van der Waals-like phase transitions and uses Lyapunov exponents and quasi-periodic oscillations as dynamical indicators of these transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how thermodynamic phase transitions in black holes manifest in dynamical properties of orbiting particles, providing new probes for black hole phase structure analysis.

Method: Analyzes free energy vs. Hawking temperature for phase transitions, examines timelike geodesics for unstable orbits, calculates Lyapunov exponents for particle stability, and uses relativistic precession models to derive quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies.

Result: Phase transitions correspond to changes in Lyapunov exponents and oscillation frequencies, showing these dynamical quantities effectively indicate black hole thermodynamic phases.

Conclusion: Lyapunov exponents and quasi-periodic oscillations serve as sensitive probes for detecting thermodynamic phase transitions in magnetic AdS black holes, bridging thermodynamics and orbital dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phase structure of a nonminimal coupled
magnetic AdS black hole by connecting its thermodynamic properties with the
dynamical behavior of orbiting particles, within the framework of Lyapunov
exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation. The analysis of the free energy as a
function of the Hawking temperature reveals a Van der Waals-like phase
transition, characterized by the coexistence of small, intermediate, and large
black hole phases. By examining timelike geodesics corresponding to unstable
circular orbits, we evaluate the Lyapunov exponent of the test particles
crossing the phase transition and explore its role as dynamical indicator of
stability. Furthermore, by perturbing the unstable circular orbit and employing
the relativistic precession model, we explore the associated upper and lower
quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies. Our findings show that the occurrence
of thermodynamic phase transitions induces marked changes in both Lyapunov
exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation spectra, indicating that these
dynamical quantities can serve as sensitive probes of the underlying
thermodynamic phase structure of the black hole.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the orbital structure and precession dynamics of neutral test
particles in the magnetized Kerr black hole (MKBH) spacetime-an exact
electrovacuum solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations that self-consistently
incorporates the curvature effects of an external magnetic field. This geometry
allows a unified treatment of gravitational and magnetic influences across weak
to ultra-strong regimes. The analysis reveals a critical magnetic field
strength above which no circular geodesics, timelike or null, can exist,
establishing an upper magnetic bound for orbital motion. For subcritical
fields, the photon circular orbit admits two real roots, the outer of which
defines an outermost stable circular orbit (OSCO), complementing the
conventional innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and confining stable motion
within a finite radial domain. Exact expressions for the orbital, radial, and
vertical epicyclic frequencies, and their associated precession rates, show
substantial deviations from Kerr behavior, including a magnetically induced
reversal of periastron precession within a finite radial range. For
astrophysically relevant magnetic field strengths, the retrograde precession
could be observable at large radii around astrophysical BHs, offering a
potential diagnostic of large-scale magnetization. These findings highlight the
geometric influence of magnetic curvature on strong-field dynamics, providing a
self-consistent framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenology
and potential magnetic imprints in precision timing observations of compact
objects.

*Theophanes K. Karydas,Rodrigo Vicente,Gianfranco Bertone*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study explores how a secondary black hole's spin in E/IMRIs within dark matter spikes affects mass accretion and spin evolution. Higher spin reduces accretion but amplifies torques leading to spin-down and alignment with the orbital plane. A universal mass-spin correlation with parameter s ~ 2.8 is found, independent of density and spike slope, suggesting that quickly spinning IMRI companions indicate no dense DM environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of the companion black hole's spin on dark matter accretion and orbital dynamics in E/IMRIs, and to assess observational implications for detecting dense DM environments.

Method: Theoretical analysis of collisionless DM accretion onto a spinning secondary black hole in a binary system, calculating mass accretion rates and torques induced by DM particles. Derives evolution equations for spin magnitude and orientation under these processes.

Result: Higher spin suppresses mass accretion but enhances torque-induced spin-down and alignment with orbital plane. Universality in mass-spin correlation (s ≈2.8) emerges, independent of local DM density/spike slope. Spin-down occurs on astrophysical timescales relevant for observations.

Conclusion: Observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor dense DM environments, offering constraints complementary to those from dynamical friction studies.

Abstract: In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in
dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless
particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion's spin controls
this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of
the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass
accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down
and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane.
Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin
correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much
larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely
independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated
spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of
rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM
environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from
dynamical friction.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential
equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of
Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective
for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing
many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To
address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including
auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the
standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact
physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that
these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss
landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a
proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for
gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free
compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency
waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass
$M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this
controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude
improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise
difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for
large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving
realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore quantum gravity effects in black hole spacetimes using NC geometry, focusing on how the deformation caused by noncommutativity alters the QNM properties compared to the classical case.

Method: Applied semiclassical NC gauge theory, modeled massless Dirac fields dynamics using continued fraction method enhanced with Gauss elimination for solving six-term recurrence relations.

Result: Observed notable shifts in oscillation frequencies and damping rates, with a Zeeman-like splitting in QNM spectra directly linked to the NC parameter.

Conclusion: NC geometry produces measurable modifications in black hole QNMs, offering a potential observational signature for quantum gravity effects in deformed spacetimes.

Abstract: Noncommutative (NC) geometry provides a novel approach to probe quantum
gravity effects in black hole spacetimes. This work explores Dirac quasinormal
modes (QNMs) of a deformed Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where
noncommutativity induces an effective metric with an additional ($ r-\varphi$)
component. Employing a semiclassical model equivalent to a NC gauge theory, we
investigate the dynamics of massless Dirac fields and calculate their QNM
frequencies using the continued fraction method, enhanced by Gauss elimination
to address the six-term recurrence relations. Our results demonstrate notable
shifts in oscillation frequencies and damping rates relative to the commutative
Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, exhibiting a distinctive Zeeman-like splitting in
the QNM spectrum driven by the NC parameter.

TL;DR: The paper explores the generation of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), focusing on their evolution through a quantum bounce and subsequent inflation, analyzing power spectra, initial conditions, coupling functions, and backreaction to determine observable PMF levels today.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand PMFs' origin and their potential role as seeds for extragalactic magnetic fields, enabling insights into primordial physics via observations of extragalactic fields.

Method: Examines electromagnetic fields as test fields in LQC, studying their evolution through quantum bounce and inflation; analyzes power spectra under various initial conditions, coupling functions, and backreaction effects.

Result: PMF power spectra exhibit scale dependence; analysis quantifies measurable PMFs today based on initial conditions and model parameters.

Conclusion: LQC provides a viable framework for PMF generation, with observable levels possible depending on initial conditions and couplings; results advance understanding of early universe physics linked to extragalactic magnetism.

Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the
early universe. These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic
magnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are
indeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that
observations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the
primordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the
primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In
LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an
electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its
evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We
investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is
scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions,
discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and
compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We
conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO)
to measure solar neutrinos is known, realizing this potential requires new
techniques to reduce detector backgrounds. One of the most serious backgrounds
is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup
(spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO
compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO's shallower depth and its lack of
directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations
of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes
and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is
showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which
are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new
techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of
five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a
factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and
$hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores whether cosmic-ray electron cooling via dark matter-electron scattering explains the low radiative efficiency in radio-loud galaxies like M87. Efficient scattering with light dark matter reduces observed luminosity, probing new dark matter parameter spaces. Simulations show such interactions can flatten spectral indices in jets, aligning with M87 observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the unexpectedly low radiative efficiency observed in radio-loud galaxies such as M87, which current astrophysical models cannot fully account for.

Method: Numerically solving a diffusion equation along the jet to model cosmic-ray electron distributions, analyzing dark matter-electron scattering effects on energy loss and spectral indices.

Result: Demonstrates that efficient dark matter-electron interactions can both reduce bolometric luminosity and produce spectral index flattening matching M87 radio data, opening new parameter space for dark matter models.

Conclusion: Dark matter interactions with electrons in jets may resolve discrepancies between observed and predicted radiative efficiencies, offering a novel astrophysical probe of light dark matter properties.

Abstract: We investigate the possibility that cosmic-ray electron cooling through dark
matter-electron scatterings contributes to the low radiative efficiency
observed in radio-loud galaxies such as M87. Light dark matter can scatter
efficiently off electrons in M87, lowering the observed bolometric luminosity
compared to astrophysical expectations. This consideration allows us to probe
previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark matter-electron
interactions. We further model the cosmic-ray electron distribution by
numerically solving a diffusion equation along the jet and find that efficient
dark matter-electron interactions can induce a flattening of the spectral index
at different distances from the central supermassive black hole, in better
alignment with radio observations from M87.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mechanism in scale-invariant gravity where the Planck mass is dynamically generated, leading to Einstein gravity, successful inflation, and resolution of the Standard Model's hierarchy problem. It explores dynamical symmetry breaking for scale generation and discusses the resulting phenomenological implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model and unify the generation of the Planck mass with mechanisms for inflation while maintaining scale invariance in gravity.

Method: Proposing a scale-invariant gravity theory where the Planck mass dynamically breaks symmetry, resulting in Einstein gravity. This mechanism is analyzed for its role in inflation and solving the hierarchy problem through detailed study of symmetry breaking and phenomenological consequences.

Result: The mechanism successfully links dynamical scale generation to both inflation and the hierarchy problem resolution, providing a consistent framework for these phenomena within a scale-invariant model.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a viable path to unify gravitational scale generation with cosmological inflation and particle physics hierarchy issues, highlighting the importance of dynamical symmetry breaking in fundamental physics.

Abstract: We propose a mechanism where the dynamical generation of the Planck mass in
scale invariant gravity leads to Einstein gravity, successful inflation and an
explanation of the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. We will discuss in
detail the scale generation by dynamical symmetry breaking and phenomenological
consequences.

### [38] [Hadronic vacuum polarization to three loops in chiral perturbation theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12885)
*Laurent Lellouch,Alessandro Lupo,Mattias Sjö,Kálmán Szabo,Pierre Vanhove*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates the hadronic vacuum polarization effect using two-flavor chiral perturbation theory at three loops, addressing precision limitations in Standard Model tests. It introduces five new elliptic master integrals related to the three-loop sunset integral and establishes new renormalization relations essential for future phenomenological and lattice QCD computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision of Standard Model tests by accurately computing hadronic vacuum polarization effects that currently limit experimental measurements. This work aims to provide a foundation for phenomenological applications and lattice QCD finite-volume corrections.

Method: Employed three-loop two-flavor chiral perturbation theory. Computed master integrals including six elliptic functions (five newly derived), leveraging connections to the three-loop sunset integral. Established new renormalization relationships not derived from standard integration-by-parts techniques.

Result: Derivation of five novel elliptic master integrals and identification of previously unknown integral relations critical for renormalization. Results enable more precise calculations for Standard Model validation and lattice QCD studies.

Conclusion: The calculated hadronic vacuum polarization provides necessary input for high-precision phenomenological analyses and lattice QCD finite-volume corrections. The discovered renormalization mechanisms expand understanding of non-perturbative integral relations in quantum field theories.

Abstract: Hadronic vacuum polarization at low virtualities limits the precision of
experimental tests of the standard model via important physical observables.
Here we compute that effect in two-flavor chiral perturbation theory to three
loops. Among the master integrals that describe the amplitude, six are elliptic
functions of the momentum. Of these five are new to this work, although all can
be related to the three-loop sunset integral. The renormalizability of the
amplitude hinges on relations between the master integrals that were not
previously known and that are not consequences of the integration-by-parts
reduction. Our result is intended to serve as a starting point for
phenomenological calculations, as well as the computation of finite-volume
corrections in lattice QCD.

*T. Gökalp Elaçmaz,Ivan Martinez-Soler,Yuber F. Perez-Gonzalez*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reactor antineutrino data to improve constraints on large extra dimensions (LED), finding tighter bounds on the radius of extra dimensions, especially with more dimensions and specific neutrino mass orderings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To update and refine constraints on large extra dimensions using the latest reactor antineutrino data, addressing gaps in previous studies and exploring effects of different neutrino mass orderings.

Method: The authors analyze data from Daya Bay, RENO, KamLAND, NEOS, and STEREO experiments. They model scenarios with 1 to 4 extra dimensions, assuming equal radii and a massless lightest active neutrino, applying statistical methods to derive confidence level bounds.

Result: Significant improvements in constraints: For 1 dimension, bounds tightened by ~20-25% (e.g., a ≤ 0.58 μm for normal ordering). For 4 dimensions, limits are stricter (e.g., a ≤ 0.05 μm for inverted ordering at 99% CL). Constraints strengthen with more dimensions.

Conclusion: Reactor antineutrino experiments provide robust constraints on LED models, with increased sensitivity when considering more dimensions. Results support refining theoretical models and guide future high-sensitivity neutrino experiments.

Abstract: We investigate constraints on large extra dimensions (LED) using the latest
results from reactor antineutrino experiments. Specifically, we analyze the
full data sets from Daya Bay, RENO, KamLAND, NEOS, and STEREO to derive updated
bounds. For the case of one extra dimension, we find constrains on its radius
$a$ of $a \lesssim 0.58~{\rm \mu m}$ ($a \lesssim 0.12~{\rm \mu m}$) at the
$99\%$ confidence level for normal (inverted) ordering, an improvement of
approximately $\sim 20\%$ ($\sim 25\%$) with respect to previous bounds,
assuming a massless lightest active neutrino. Furthermore, we present new
limits on $4+d$ LED scenarios, with $d = 2, 3, 4$ denoting the number of extra
dimensions, based on the same reactor data and assuming equal radii for all
extra dimensions. We find that the constraints become increasingly stringent
with a larger number of extra dimensions. In particular, $d = 4$ with a
massless lightest active neutrino, we obtain limits of $a \lesssim 0.28~{\rm
\mu m}$ for normal and $a \lesssim 0.05~{\rm \mu m}$ for inverted orderings at
the $99\%$ confidence level.

*Hitansh Shah,Mauricio Hippert,Jorge Noronha,Claudia Ratti,Volodymyr Vovchenko*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method using constant entropy density contours to locate the QCD critical point, determining it at T_c = 114±7 MeV and μ_{B_c} = 602±62 MeV, consistent with lattice QCD results up to μ_B/T ≤ 3. Further lattice simulations are needed for precise expansion coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the QCD critical point and improve understanding of phase transitions in quantum chromodynamics, addressing limitations in current methods for determining critical endpoints at non-zero baryon chemical potential.

Method: Constructing an expansion along constant entropy density contours applied to lattice QCD data at zero baryon chemical potential. The analysis is truncated at μ_B² order and validated against existing lattice results.

Result: Identified critical point parameters: T_c = 114±7 MeV and μ_{B_c} = 602±62 MeV. The method aligns with lattice QCD data up to μ_B/T ratios of 3, but precision in expansion coefficients requires further lattice simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a viable approach to locate the QCD critical endpoint, though its reliability depends on higher precision lattice data for expansion coefficients to reduce uncertainties.

Abstract: We propose a novel method to locate the QCD critical point by constructing an
expansion along contours of constant entropy density. Applying two independent
analysis of lattice QCD data at zero baryon chemical potential, we find a
critical point at $T_c = 114 \pm 7$ MeV and $\mu_{B_c} = 602 \pm 62$ MeV for an
expansion truncated at order $\mu_B^2$. This approach is consistent with recent
lattice QCD results up to $\mu_B/T \leq 3$. A more precise determination of the
required expansion coefficients from lattice simulations will be essential for
reliably establishing the location of the QCD critical endpoint.

*Xuan Luo,Shu-Wei Zhang,Hua-Xing Chen,Atsushi Hosaka,Niu Su,Hui-Min Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper reviews QCD sum rule studies on P-wave singly heavy baryons, explaining observed states like those in charmed and bottom systems, and predicts new narrow states. It also explores connections to fundamental questions in particle physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze P-wave singly heavy baryons using QCD sum rules within heavy quark effective theory, explain observed excited states, predict new particles, and address broader theoretical questions in particle physics.

Method: QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules applied to P-wave singly heavy baryons within the framework of heavy quark effective theory.

Result: Confirmed explanation of numerous observed baryons and predicted additional narrow states in both charm and bottom systems, totaling 13 new potential candidates.

Conclusion: QCD sum rule methods effectively describe singly heavy baryons' spectra and guide experimental searches. The study highlights unresolved theoretical questions about particle lifetime limits and symmetry descriptions.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, the study of singly heavy baryons has entered a
golden era, with numerous excited states observed by experimental
collaborations. Various theoretical approaches have been developed to
investigate their properties, with the QCD sum rule method being one of the
most widely applied. This paper provides a review of these QCD sum rule
studies. Over the last ten years, we have systematically studied $P$-wave
singly heavy baryons using QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the
framework of heavy quark effective theory. These $P$-wave singly heavy baryons
can explain many excited heavy baryons, including the $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$,
$\Lambda_c(2625)^+$, $\Xi_c(2790)^{0/+}$, $\Xi_c(2815)^{0/+}$,
$\Sigma_c(2800)^0$, $\Xi_c(2882)^0$, $\Xi_c(2923)^0$, $\Xi_c(2939)^0$,
$\Xi_c(2965)^0$, $\Omega_c(3000)^0$, $\Omega_c(3066)^0$, $\Omega_c(3090)^0$,
$\Omega_c(3050)^0$, $\Omega_c(3119)^0$, $\Lambda_b(5912)^0$,
$\Lambda_b(5920)^0$, $\Xi_b(6087)^0$, $\Xi_b(6095)^0/\Xi_b(6100)^-$,
$\Sigma_b(6097)^\pm$, $\Xi_b(6227)^-$, $\Omega_b(6316)^-$, $\Omega_b(6330)^-$,
$\Omega_b(6340)^-$, and $\Omega_b(6350)^-$, etc. Furthermore, we predict
additional $P$-wave singly heavy baryons, including two $\Lambda_b$ states, two
$\Xi_b$ states, three $\Sigma_b$ states, three $\Xi_b^\prime$ states, two
$\Omega_b$ states, two $\Lambda_c$ states, two $\Xi_c$ states, three $\Sigma_c$
states, and one $\Omega_c$ state, all with relatively narrow decay widths,
making them viable candidates for experimental observation. The study of singly
heavy baryons is closely related to two meaningful questions:"What is the
shortest possible lifetime of an observable particle?" and "How can one
generally describe approximate (flavor) symmetries?".

### [42] [Coscattering Dark Matter in Scotogenic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13231)
*Ang Liu,Zhi-Long Han,Fei Huang,Feng-Lan Shao,Wei Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores an extended Scotogenic model with two nearly degenerate dark scalars, φ1 and φ2, to address dark matter relic density and neutrino masses, while evading experimental constraints through coscattering and coannihilation mechanisms, and predicting displaced vertices at colliders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To naturally explain dark matter and tiny neutrino masses within the Scotogenic framework while overcoming constraints from lepton flavor violation and direct detection. The model requires at least two dark particle generations for neutrino masses.

Method: Consider a scenario where dark scalars φ1 and φ2 have nearly equal masses. Analyze relic density via coscattering (φ1SM→φ2SM) and coannihilation (φ1φ2→SMSM) via Higgs/Yukawa portals. Study constraints from Higgs decay, direct, and indirect detection. Investigate φ2's three-body decay effects on BBN, CMB, and collider signatures.

Result: Identifies viable parameter regions where coscattering主导 relic abundance, contrasts with coannihilation. Shows displaced vertices from φ2 decays are detectable. Constraints from Higgs physics and direct detection limit but do not exclude the model.

Conclusion: The degenerate dark scalar scenario offers a compelling Scotogenic variant with testable collider signals and able to evade key astrophysical constraints, providing a path forward for future experiments.

Abstract: The Scotogenic mechanism is an appealing pathway to naturally explain the
common origin of dark matter and tiny neutrino mass. However, the conventional
scotogenic dark matter usually suffers stringent constraints from the
non-observation of lepton flavor violation and direct detection. To generate
the non-zero neutrino masses, at least two generations of dark particles are
required. For example, two real scalar singlets $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are
involved in the scotogenic inverse model, which are odd under the $Z_2$
symmetry. In this paper, we consider the masses of dark scalars are nearly
degenerate $m_{\phi_1}\lesssim m_{\phi_2}$, which opens new viable pathway for
the generation of dark matter $\phi_1$, such as the coscattering process
$\phi_1\text{SM}\to \phi_2 \text{SM}$ and coannihilation processes $\phi_1
\phi_2 \to \text{SM SM}$ via the Higgs portal or Yukawa portal interactions. We
explore the parameter space to produce the correct relic density through
coscattering, as well as the contrastive coannihilation channel. We then
comprehensively study the constraints of dark matter from Higgs decay, direct
detection, and indirect detection. For the heavier dark scalar, the three-body
decay $\phi_2\to\phi_1 f\bar{f}$ not only alerts the predictions of big bang
nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background, but also leads to the
observable displaced vertex signature at colliders.

### [43] [Strange Pentaquark Molecules in QCD Sum Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13548)
*Di-Ben,Sheng-Qi Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study uses QCD sum rules to construct 21 pentaquark currents, identifying three bound states as molecular systems involving strange quarks and proposing multiplet partnerships between Λ(2050) and Ξ(2250).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To search for hadronic molecular state multiplets in the strange quark sector by systematically constructing pentaquark currents, extending known resonance studies and confirming multiplet structures predicted by QCD.

Method: 21 currents with J^P = 1/2^- and 3/2^- were analyzed via QCD sum rules. Bound states were identified from currents with 3/2^- quantum numbers, matching known resonance states while others involved excited components.

Result: Three bound states (Λφ, Ξφ, ΣK*) were found. Λ(2050) and Ξ(2250) are multiplet partners. ΣK* bound state exists but lacks corresponding partners in current constructions.

Conclusion: The results support hadronic molecular interpretations of certain resonances and suggest further investigation into alternative current configurations for missing multiplet partners.

Abstract: In this article, we systematically construct hidden- and open-strange
pentaquarks in the hadronic molecular picture to search for possible partners
of hadronic molecular state multiplets in the strange quark sector using QCD
sum rules. Within this picture, 21 distinct currents are constructed with $J^P
= 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. There is no bound state found from $J^P = 1/2^-$
currents, while three of them from $J^P = 3/2^-$ currents are bound-state
solutions consistent with the $\Lambda(2050)3/2^-$, $\Xi(2250)$, and
$N(2120)3/2^-$ states, which can be identified as $\Lambda\phi$, $\Xi\phi$, and
$\Sigma K^\ast$ hadronic molecular states, respectively. Other constructions
are interpreted as hadronic molecular states composed of excited states with
the same quantum numbers, and some of these exhibit mass values that align with
known resonances listed in the RPP(PDG). Our numerical results indicate that
$\Lambda(2050)3/2^-$ and $\Xi(2250)$ should be the multiplet partner of each
other. Additionally, although $\Sigma K^\ast$ bound state was identified under
this framework, no corresponding partner states were found within the context
of the currents we constructed. Alternative constructions may offer new
possibilities for identifying such states.

Abstract: We compute the next-to-eikonal (NEik) power corrections to inclusive deep
inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS)
at low $x$ beyond dipole factorization, which represent the eikonal result. The
analysis is restricted to contributions arising from t-channel quark exchanges,
thereby probing the quark background field of the target. For a transversely
polarized virtual photon, the NEik corrections to inclusive DIS are expressed
in terms of quark and antiquark collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs),
while the corresponding corrections to SIDIS are formulated in terms of the
unpolarized quark transverse-momentum-dependent distribution (TMD). In
contrast, for a longitudinally polarized photon, the NEik corrections to both
inclusive DIS and SIDIS vanish at lowest order in $\alpha_{s}$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry is an attractive flavour symmetry in lepton
mixing, which accommodates maximal values of atmospheric mixing angle
($\theta_{23}=\pi/4$) and Dirac CP phase ($\delta=\pi/2/3\pi/2$). Another
significance of this symmetry is that it does not constrain $\theta_{13}$ to be
zero. As the recent results from $T2K$ and $NO\nu A$ experiments indicate a
near-maximal value of the Dirac CP phase, the role of $\mu-\tau$ reflection
symmetry becomes more prominent. In this work, we study RG running effects as a
perturbation to the $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry. Assuming the symmetry to be
preserved at the seesaw scale, we study the deviations of mass eigenvalues and
lepton mixing parameters at the electroweak scale due to RG running. We derive
the one-loop RGEs of the mass eigenvalues and mixing parameters and solve them
numerically. Numerical analysis shows that the deviations from $\mu-\tau$
reflection symmetry are consistent with $3\sigma$ range of global oscillation
data.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines how flavor symmetries of the Froggatt-Nielsen type suppress nucleon decay via dimension-five operators in supersymmetric models, using Bayesian analysis to show the necessity of a multi-messenger approach for probing supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address constraints from flavor and CP observables at the PeV scale and explore how flavor symmetries can suppress nucleon decay in supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale.

Method: Investigation of nucleon decay induced by dimension-five operators in supersymmetric standard models, applying Bayesian analysis on flavor, CP, and proton-decay data to assess parameter space and predictions.

Result: Demonstrates that a multi-messenger approach integrating flavor, CP, and baryon-number-violating observables is essential for probing supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale.

Conclusion: Flavor symmetries like Froggatt-Nielsen can suppress nucleon decay, and combining multiple observables is crucial for testing supersymmetric models at high scales.

Abstract: Supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale offers several theoretical and
phenomenological advantages, such as accommodating the observed Higgs mass and
alleviating the flavor and CP problems. However, flavor and CP observables
still impose stringent constraints even at the PeV scale, motivating a
systematic study of flavor symmetries in this regime. In this work, we
investigate nucleon decay induced by dimension-five operators in supersymmetric
standard models and examine how flavor symmetries, particularly of the
Froggatt-Nielsen type, can suppress these operators. We perform a Bayesian
analysis combining flavor, CP, and proton-decay observables to quantify the
allowed parameter space and identify characteristic predictions. Our results
demonstrate that a multi-messenger approach, integrating flavor, CP, and
baryon-number-violating observables, is essential for probing the underlying
structure of supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the radiative decay of the Ω(2012) resonance through a theoretical model involving triangular loop mechanisms and final state interactions, predicting a decay width of 13.2±4.5/-3.9 KeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nature of the Ω(2012) resonance, particularly its radiative decay dynamics and the role of its substructure (from K̄Ξ(1530), ηΩ, and K̄Ξ interactions) in decay processes.

Method: The study employs a triangular loop mechanism where Ω(2012) couples to K̄Ξ(1530) channel. Final state interactions via Ξ(baryon) exchange facilitate the transition to photon and Ω. Calculations consider s-wave and d-wave dynamics for different channels.

Result: The calculated radiative decay width is 13.2 KeV with uncertainties, aligning with experimental expectations and offering new insights into Ω(2012)'s structure.

Conclusion: The results suggest the Ω(2012) likely has a dynamically generated substructure. They emphasize the importance of future experiments to verify these predictions and deeper study of Ω(2012)'s elusive nature.

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the radiative decay process
$\Omega(2012) \to \gamma \Omega$, where the $\Omega(2012)$ resonance with
spin-parity $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$, is treated as a dynamically generated state
from $\bar{K}\Xi(1530)$ and $\eta \Omega$ in $s$-wave and $\bar{K}\Xi$ in
$d$-wave. The radiative decay width of the $\Omega(2012)$ is calculated using a
triangular loop mechanism, where the $\Omega(2012)$ couples to the $\bar{K}
\Xi(1530)$ channel. Subsequently, the final state interactions between
$\Xi(1530)$ and $\bar{K}$ transition to a photon and $\Omega$ through the
exchange of a $\Xi$ baryon. Our calculations yield a radiative decay width of
$13.2 ^{+4.5}_{-3.9}$ KeV, with uncertainties arising from the model
parameters. This result provides valuable insights into the nature of the
$\Omega(2012)$ resonance and its decay dynamics. It is expected that the
calculations presented here could be verified by future experiments, which
would open a new door for studying the still elusive nature of the
$\Omega(2012)$.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines strong vertices of $DK$, $D^*K$, $DK^*$, and their bottom counterparts using three-point QCD sum rules. Strong coupling constants are derived, and partial decay widths are calculated, showing agreement with experimental data for specific charmed mesons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate hadronic molecule states and validate theoretical models against experimental observations, particularly for decay processes like those observed in $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$. This helps in understanding strong interactions and quark-gluon dynamics within these composite particles.

Method: Employed three-point QCD sum rules to calculate strong coupling constants. The phenomenological side involved coupling between interpolating currents and low-spin particles, while the QCD side included vacuum condensates like $\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle$, $\left\langle g_s^2GG \right\rangle$, etc. Decay widths were computed using these coupling constants.

Result: Calculated partial decay widths: $\Gamma_{T_{DK}\rightarrow D_s\pi}=10.3_{-2.9}^{+3.0}\mathrm{KeV}$, $\Gamma_{T_{D^*K}\rightarrow D_s^*\pi}=24.8_{-5.4}^{+5.5}\mathrm{KeV}$, $\Gamma_{T_{BK}\rightarrow BK}=101_{-21}^{+36}\mathrm{MeV}$, and $\Gamma_{T_{B^*K}\rightarrow B^*K}=142_{-25}^{+52}\mathrm{MeV}$. Results for the charm sector align with experimental data from $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$.

Conclusion: The analysis supports the hadronic molecule interpretation of observed states. The QCD sum rule method accurately predicts decay widths, validating its utility for studying exotic hadrons and their interaction dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the strong vertices of hadronic molecules $DK$,
$D^*K$, $DK^*$ and their bottom analogs within the framework of three-point QCD
sum rules. The coupling between interpolating currents and low spin particles
is considered in the phenomenological side, and the vacuum condensates
$\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle ,\left\langle g_s^2GG \right\rangle
,\left\langle \bar qg_s\sigma Gq \right\rangle ,\left\langle g_s^3GGG
\right\rangle ,{\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle ^2}$ are included in the QCD
side. As an application of strong coupling constants, we also obtain the
partial decay widths of these states, where $\Gamma_{T_{DK}\rightarrow
D_s\pi}=10.3_{-2.9}^{+3.0}\mathrm{KeV}$,
  $\Gamma_{T_{D^*K}\rightarrow D_s^*\pi}=24.8_{-5.4}^{+5.5}\mathrm{KeV}$,
$\Gamma_{T_{BK}\rightarrow BK}=101_{-21}^{+36}\mathrm{MeV}$ and
$\Gamma_{T_{B^*K}\rightarrow B^*K}=142_{-25}^{+52}\mathrm{MeV}$. It is shown
that the results of $\Gamma_{T_{DK}\rightarrow D_s\pi}$ and
$\Gamma_{T_{D^*K}\rightarrow D_s^*\pi}$ are compatible with the experimental
data of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$.

Abstract: We propose a simple and unified framework that simultaneously explains the
origins of light Dirac neutrino masses, asymmetric dark matter (ADM), and the
baryon asymmetry of the Universe. The model is based on an extended $U(1)_X$
Froggatt-Nielsen--like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa
couplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions
charged under $\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs
through the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the
generated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact
lepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the
smallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical
studies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent
with relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection
constraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection
between neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free
setup.

Abstract: An analysis of baryogenesis and stochastic gravitational wave production is
presented for an extension of the standard model where the dark sector consists
of dark matter particles charged under a $U(1)_x$ gauge symmetry, while a
subset of dark fields also carry lepton number but no $U(1)_x$ charge. We
demonstrate that with CP violation induced by Yukawa couplings, equal and
opposite lepton asymmetries are generated in the visible and hidden sectors.
Subsequent evolution preserves lepton number separately in each sector, and
sphaleron interactions partially convert the lepton asymmetry into baryon
asymmetry near the temperature of the first-order phase transition. Further, we
discuss stochastic gravitational wave background production for the first-order
phase transition using a gauge-independent bubble nucleation dynamics which
yields spectra also valid in the supercooled low-temperature regime with
{$T_p/m_{A_x} \ll 1$} where $T_p$ is the percolation temperature and $m_{A_x}$
is the dark photon mass. A parameter-space scan identifies regions that
simultaneously account for cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter and
predict stochastic gravitational wave signals within reach of current
(NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA) and future detectors at higher frequencies, providing a
unified framework for cogenesis and associated gravitational wave production.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in previous studies that analyzed TMD and collinear PDFs separately, leading to inconsistent results, especially in sea quarks. The goal is to provide a unified framework for accurate PDF determinations.

Method: Performed a simultaneous analysis of TMD and collinear PDFs using NNLL accuracy for TMD observables and NLO for collinear processes. Incorporated diverse datasets from DIS, Drell-Yan, weak boson production, etc., ensuring comprehensive coverage of proton interactions.

Result: Significantly improved precision in sea-quark PDFs and achieved consistency between TMD and collinear predictions across all datasets. Reduced uncertainties in TMD parameters and validated the approach through cross-checks with independent experiments.

Conclusion: The unified analysis demonstrates the necessity of simultaneous TMD-collinear PDF fits for accurate descriptions of high-energy proton collisions, establishing a foundational framework for future high-precision studies in particle physics.

Abstract: We present the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of unpolarized

fixed target and collider experiments sensitive to both TMD and collinear
distributions. The analysis is performed at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic
accuracy for QCD resummation in TMD observables and next-to-leading order for
observables described in collinear factorization. The combined analysis
improves knowledge of both TMD and collinear PDFs, particularly in the
sea-quark sector, providing a consistent simultaneous description of the

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach combining diffusion models and inverse
problems for the reconstruction of circumstellar disk images. Our method builds
upon the Rhapsodie framework for polarimetric imaging, substituting its
classical prior with a diffusion model trained on synthetic data. Our
formulation explicitly incorporates stellar leakage while efficiently handling
missing data and high level noise inherent to high-contrast polarimetric
imaging. Experiments show significant improvement over conventional methods
within our framework of assumptions, opening new perspectives for studying
circumstellar environments.

### [53] [Simulation of Time-dependent Karhunen-Loeve Phase Screens: an Ergodic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12861)
*Richard J. Mathar*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper discusses a new method called the ergodic ansatz for simulating time-dependent phase screens in ground-based astronomy using a 3D von-Karman turbulence model. It replaces the traditional frozen-screen approach by generating phase screens via 2D cuts through a 3D volume, which are then dragged to create dynamic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of simulating atmospheric turbulence effects on telescope observations. The traditional frozen-screen method has limitations, such as static phase screens and unrealistic dynamics, while the proposed 3D ergodic approach offers a more physically realistic model with better ergodic properties for statistical sampling.

Method: The method involves constructing a three-dimensional von-Karman turbulence volume (spherical for efficiency), creating 2D phase screens by slicing this volume, and moving these slices at a specified speed to simulate time-dependent phase changes. This approach models the temporal evolution more accurately through linear algebra techniques to populate the 3D volume.

Result: The paper presents the linear algebra framework necessary to implement the 3D ergodic ansatz for the von-Karman model. It demonstrates how this method can generate realistic time-dependent phase screens with improved statistical properties compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes that the ergodic ansatz provides a more physically accurate and efficient computational model for simulating atmospheric phase fluctuations. It opens avenues for better simulation tools in adaptive optics and astronomical instrumentation, addressing limitations of previous techniques.

Abstract: Time-dependent phase screens in ground-based astronomy are typically
simulated in the so-called frozen-screen approximation by establishing a static
phase screen on a large pupil and dragging an aperture equivalent to the size
of the actual input pupil across this oversized phase screen. The speed of this
motion sweeping through the large phase screen is equivalent to a wind speed
that changes the phase screen as a function of time.
  The ergodic ansatz replaces this concept by constructing the structure
function in a three-dimensional volume -- a sphere for reasons of computational
efficiency -- , sampling phase screens by two-dimensional planar cuts through
that volume, and dragging them along the surface normal at some speed which
generates a video of a phase screen.
  This manuscript addresses the linear algebra of populating the
three-dimensional volume with phase screens of the von-Karman model of
atmospheric turbulence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of analyzing large-scale scientific datasets, such as their size, complexity, and need for specialized knowledge, make existing tools like PandasAI impractical due to their requirement for full data ingestion and lack of context awareness.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent architecture with a supervisor agent coordinating specialized agents for data retrieval and analysis phases, combined with interactive user engagement to align system actions with user goals.

Result: Evaluated using ensemble runs from the HACC cosmology simulation (several terabytes), demonstrating the framework's usability for large-scale data analysis.

Conclusion: InferA addresses scalability and efficiency issues in automated analysis of terabyte-scale scientific datasets through its multi-agent system and interactive design.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale scientific datasets presents substantial challenges due
to their sheer volume, structural complexity, and the need for specialized
domain knowledge. Automation tools, such as PandasAI, typically require full
data ingestion and lack context of the full data structure, making them
impractical as intelligent data analysis assistants for datasets at the
terabyte scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose InferA, a multi-agent
system that leverages large language models to enable scalable and efficient
scientific data analysis. At the core of the architecture is a supervisor agent
that orchestrates a team of specialized agents responsible for distinct phases
of the data retrieval and analysis. The system engages interactively with users
to elicit their analytical intent and confirm query objectives, ensuring
alignment between user goals and system actions. To demonstrate the framework's
usability, we evaluate the system using ensemble runs from the HACC cosmology
simulation which comprises several terabytes.

TL;DR: ComPair, a prototype for the AMEGO mission, combines Compton imaging and pair production techniques with four detection subsystems to measure gamma-rays. Calibration results show it meets simulated performance expectations for angular resolution, energy resolution, and effective area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess ComPair's capabilities before its 2023 balloon launch, evaluations were conducted to confirm its performance metrics.

Method: Calibrations were performed on the four subsystems (DSSD Tracker, CZT Low Energy Calorimeter, CsI High Energy Calorimeter, and Plastic Scintillator ACD) to measure angular resolution, energy resolution, and effective area. Results were compared against simulation predictions.

Result: Calibration outcomes align with pre-mission simulations, validating ComPair’s design and readiness for the upcoming launch.

Conclusion: The successful calibration confirms ComPair’s scientific potential, supporting its role as a precursor to the AMEGO mission and justifying its planned deployment.

Abstract: ComPair, the prototype of the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory
(AMEGO) mission concept, is a combined Compton imager and pair production
telescope. It consists of four subsystems: a double-sided silicon strip
detector (DSSD) Tracker, a virtual Frisch-grid cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) Low
Energy Calorimeter, a cesium iodide (CsI) High Energy Calorimeter, and a
plastic scintillator Anti-Coincidence Detector (ACD) to reject the charged
particle background. These subsystems work together to reconstruct events, by
tracking the locations and energies of gamma-ray scatters and pair production
events. To quantify ComPair's scientific capabilities prior to a balloon launch
in 2023, calibrations were performed to benchmark the instrument's performance
in terms of angular resolution, energy resolution, and effective area. In this
paper we provide an overview of the ComPair instrument and detail the
calibration campaign. Finally, we compare our results to the expected
performance based on simulations.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for accurate PSF characterization and subtraction in photometric surveys, particularly improving analysis near bright stars and enabling study of low surface brightness features. The extended PSF has varying ring structures across filters, and the method enhances survey efficiency by 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Default PSF pipelines are inadequate for analyzing regions near bright stars due to small PSF sizes, limiting LSB studies and photometric accuracy. The need exists for a precise PSF model covering larger radii and varying filters.

Method: Developed a novel pipeline combining PSF components from multiple stars, avoiding fixed radii through a new method. Includes automatic reflection masking, star centroiding without Gaia data, and classification. The PSF model spans 15 mag arcsec-2 and 4 arcmin radius in broad bands, with filter-dependent ring structures.

Result: The PSF shows no significant time or position variation within 2.5 hours/field. NGC 4212's radial profile post-subtraction validates effectiveness. The method increases survey area by 10%, improves sky subtraction, and enables LSB analysis in wide surveys like J-PLUS and J-PAS.

Conclusion: Accurate PSF characterization through the new pipeline enhances photometric surveys' scope and precision. The open-source tool is adaptable to other surveys, with major impacts expected for deeper surveys like J-PAS. Reproducibility is ensured via code commit.

Abstract: Photometric surveys require precise point spread function (PSF)
characterization, as it varies across filters and is crucial for accurate
photometry and low surface brightness (LSB) studies. However, the small PSF
size provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making
it difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions
unusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each
exposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4
arcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF
exhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed.
Additionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the
filters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no
significant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time
(within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212
(which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We
developed a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated
stars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror
reflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining
different stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a
fixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial
measurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction
improves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about
10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys
like J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be
customized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even
greater due to its depth. This paper is fully reproducible and produced from
Commit 4860c70.

Abstract: Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity
of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that
leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples
from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple
astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that
transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures
enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic
models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline
methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when
fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective
zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future
telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF)
data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena
(namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being
trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our
approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled
data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.

Abstract: We present a new implementation of nuclear reaction networks in the
\texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical
(\texttt{Gmunu}) code, a framework for general relativistic radiation
magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD). The extended code self-consistently evolves
nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino
radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's
equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source
terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is
performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a
tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic
tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia
supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and
fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine
precision.
  As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova
simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of
standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock.
Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics,
converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening
the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta
composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled
GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with
multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code
combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.

TL;DR: The paper discusses methods to measure cosmic birefringence by calibrating the BICEP3 telescope using a rotating polarized source and the ISAAC receiver, addressing degeneracy with instrument polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect cosmic birefringence, which is hypothesized to cause polarization rotation in cosmic microwave background (CMB) light, while distinguishing it from instrumental polarization effects.

Method: Calibrating the BICEP3 telescope with both the telescope and the ISAAC receiver observing a rotating polarized source (RPS) to provide absolute polarization calibration, breaking the degeneracy between cosmic birefringence and instrument polarization angles.

Result: The calibration method successfully separates cosmic birefringence signals from instrumental effects, enabling accurate measurement of potential EB correlations in CMB polarization.

Conclusion: Absolute polarization calibration via RPS and ISAAC offers a reliable way to study cosmic birefringence, advancing understanding of possible parity violations in electromagnetism.

Abstract: Cosmic birefringence is a hypothesized parity violation in electromagnetism
that predicts a frequency-independent polarization rotation as light
propagates. This would rotate the light from the Cosmic Microwave Background,
producing an unexpected EB correlation. However, cosmic birefringence angle is
degenerate with instrument polarization angle, and breaking this degeneracy
requires an absolute polarization calibration. We calibrate the BICEP3
telescope (a 95GHz CMB polarimeter) by observing a rotating polarized source
(RPS) with both the telescope and a small test receiver called the In-Situ
Absolute Angle Calibrator (ISAAC).

Abstract: Kernel phase interferometry (KPI) is a post-processing technique that treats
a conventional telescope as an interferometer by accurately modeling a
telescope pupil as an array of virtual subapertures. KPI provides angular
resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase
errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular
resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially
useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the
largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI
on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate
contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White
dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular
separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within
$\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four
known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows
that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space
where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to
exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white
dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in
post-main-sequence exoplanets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a new method for aperture masking interferometric (AMI) imaging at
near-IR wavelengths using radio astronomical techniques. The method starts with
derivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the
interferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using
self-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains
(i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking
interferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\mu$m and
3.8~$\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration,
near-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based
amplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source
calibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary
Wolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\sim 240$ on
the target, and $\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short
integration. The self-calibration process determines the photon path-lengths
through the optical system to each aperture using data on the target source
itself, thereby representing an essentially 'real-time', precise wavefront
error sensor. Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two
wavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10~nm to 15~nm, comparable to the
expected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star.
Including a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the
final images by about 23\%.

*Cyril Alispach,Matthieu Heller,Teresa Montaruli*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes using surrogate models based on high-level instrument response functions (IRFs) to optimize the layout of ground-based Cherenkov telescope arrays, aiming to reduce simulation time and computational resources while addressing the challenges of optimizing multi-telescope configurations, especially with diverse telescope types and varying scientific objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current array optimization relies on time-consuming human-driven brute-force methods with extensive simulations. The need to explore the full phase space of telescope positioning requires even more simulations, making the process impractical. The authors aim to develop an automated optimization approach using surrogate models to efficiently evaluate layouts, reduce computational costs, and account for systematic uncertainties introduced by different telescope types and scientific use cases.

Method: The authors propose a differential optimization program using surrogate models derived from individual telescope IRFs. They address challenges in modeling stereoscopic arrays (especially heterogeneous ones) and incorporate multiple performance metrics like trigger efficiency, angular resolution, and background rejection. The method focuses on optimizing SST-1M arrays in Hanle, India, to create a generic pipeline adaptable to other observatories.

Result: The proposed framework reduces simulation time by replacing full-event simulations with faster IRF-based surrogate models. It enables efficient exploration of array layouts considering both sensitivity and systematic uncertainties, paving the way for automated optimization suitable for next-generation arrays like CTAO.

Conclusion: The surrogate model approach successfully tackles computational limitations in optimizing heterogeneous telescope arrays. The study establishes a scalable pipeline that balances sensitivity and systematic uncertainties, critical for future observatories. Further work includes testing with mixed telescope arrays and validating with real-world data.

Abstract: Current optimization of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes arrays, also called
Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays, relies on brute-force
human-driven approaches based on large simulations requiring both high amount
of storage and long computation time. To explore the full phase space of
telescope positioning of a given array even more simulations would be required.
To optimize any array layout, we explore the possibility of developing a
differential program with surrogate models of IACT arrays based on high-level
instrument response functions (IRFs). The simulation time of a single telescope
to a cosmic-ray event can be significantly reduced with its instrument response
function or with generative models. However, it is not straight forward to
model the array of telescopes from a set of single telescope surrogate models
as the array is a stereoscopic imaging system. The complexity increases as well
if the telescopes in the array are of different types. Additionally, the
optimum of the array layout depends on the scientific use case. Current array
layout optimization are obtained by minimizing the sensitivity of the array, a
metric that depends on several high-level parameters such as the trigger
efficiency, the energy and angular resolution, as well as the background
rejection capability. The variety of telescopes types in IACT arrays, such as
in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), not only extends the
sensitive energy range but also allows for cross-calibration of the
instruments. Therefore, the optimal array layout is not only which minimizes
sensitivity but also which reduces the systematic uncertainties. We focus on
the optimization of a telescope array based on the SST-1M IACTs in Hanle,
Ladakh India aiming at building a generic optimization pipeline for future
ground-based cosmic-ray observatories
