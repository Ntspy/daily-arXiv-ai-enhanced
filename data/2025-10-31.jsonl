This thesis builds a deep learning pipeline for radio pulsar\ncandidate selection that fuses array-derived features with image diagnostics.\nFrom approximately 500 GB of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data, raw\nvoltages are converted to filterbanks (SIGPROC), then de-dispersed and folded\nacross trial dispersion measures (PRESTO) to produce approximately 32,000\ncandidates. Each candidate yields four diagnostics--summed profile, time vs.\nphase, subbands vs. phase, and DM curve--represented as arrays and images. A\nbaseline stacked model (ANNs for arrays + CNNs for images with\nlogistic-regression fusion) reaches 68% accuracy. We then refine the CNN\narchitecture and training (regularization, learning-rate scheduling, max-norm\nconstraints) and mitigate class imbalance via targeted augmentation, including\na GAN-based generator for the minority class. The enhanced CNN attains 87%\naccuracy; the final GAN+CNN system achieves 94% accuracy with balanced\nprecision and recall on a held-out test set, while remaining lightweight enough\nfor near--real-time triage.

MADs experience\npowerful flux eruptions-episodic ejections of magnetic flux from the black hole\nhorizon-that may drive the observed luminosity variations. In this work, we\ndevelop and validate a new formalism describing large-scale magnetic field\ntransport in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of MADs with\ngeometrical thicknesses of $h/R=0.1$ and $h/R=0.3$. We introduce a net flux\ntransport velocity, $v_\\Phi$, which accounts for both advective and diffusive\nprocesses. We show that MADs maintain a statistical quasi-steady state where\nadvection and diffusion nearly balance. Flux eruptions appear as small\ndeviations from this equilibrium, with $v_\\Phi/V_k\\ll1$, where $V_k$ is the\nlocal Keplerian velocity. Using this framework, we analytically derive a\nrecurrence timescale for flux eruptions, $t_{\\rm rec}\\sim1500\\, r_g/c$. This\ntimescale closely matches simulation results. The smallness of $v_\\Phi$\nexplains the long recurrence times of flux eruptions compared to other system\ntimescales.

We then\nestimate the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, defined as the ratio of\nturbulent viscosity to turbulent resistivity.

While flux eruptions excite large-scale\nnon-axisymmetric modes and locally enhance turbulent resistivity, magnetic\nfield diffusion is dominated by smaller-scale turbulent motions.

Prepared for submission to MNRAS", "summary": "The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have\nbecome the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in\ncurved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable\nreconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining\nstrong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the\nGRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high\nmagnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as\nelectron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an\nexplicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the\nstrong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be\ncrucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid\nmodel which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an\narbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared\nelectromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus\nallowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model\nmay be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the\nrelativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered\nin the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity.\nWe present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid\nequations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD\nequations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our\nmultifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the\nmagnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate\nsignificantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both\nblack hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either\naccuracy or stability."}

To investigate the possible reasons\nbehind the depolarization, we carry out analytical and full polarized radiative\ntransfer (PRT) calculations of radio point sources behind a merging galaxy\ncluster simulated using the FLASH code. With uniform background light, we\nanalyzed the rotation measure (RM) morphology near the shock front and the\ncluster center, where sloshing cold fronts appear. For the shock scenario, we\nfind a local RM enhancement by $\\sim56\\%$ behind the shock front on megaparsec\nscales, arising from the compression of hot gas and magnetic field lines.\nBehind the sloshing cold front, the cluster center shows decrement in RM\nmagnitude by $\\sim23.3\\%$, as a result of the cancellation effect of\nrandomly-oriented magnetic fields induced by sloshing-driven turbulence. We\nfind that beam depolarization increases behind shock fronts and across sloshing\ncold fronts, indicating enhanced magnetic field fluctuations across the plane\nof the sky in both scenarios. By fully accounting for all radiative transfer\ncoefficients in the PRT calculations, the uniform background light becomes more\ndepolarized near the cluster center, with the effect growing more pronounced as\nbackground intensity decreases. This suggests that synchrotron emission and\nFaraday rotation of the intracluster medium can significantly influence the\npolarization of background sources."}

Over the last few\ndecades, several numerical studies have concluded that shock-induced\ndissipation occurs as the stream returns to pericentre (i.e.,\npre-self-intersection), resulting in efficient circularisation of the debris.\nHowever, the efficacy of these shocks is the subject of intense debate. We\npresent high-resolution simulations (up to 10^10 particles) of the disruption\nof a solar-like star by a 10^6M_sun black hole with the new, GPU-based,\nsmoothed-particle hydrodynamics code SPH-EXA, including the relativistic\napsidal precession of the stellar debris orbits; our simulations run from\ninitial disruption to the moment of stream self-intersection. With 10^8\nparticles - corresponding to the highest-resolution SPH simulations of TDEs in\nthe pre-existing literature - we find significant, in-plane spreading of the\ndebris as the stream returns through pericenter, in line with previous works\nthat suggested this is a significant source of dissipation and luminous\nemission. However, with increasing resolution this effect is dramatically\ndiminished, and with 10^10 particles there is effectively no change between the\nincoming and the outgoing stream widths. Our results demonstrate that the\nparadigm of significant dissipation of kinetic energy during pericentre passage\nis incorrect, and instead it is likely that debris circularisation is mediated\nby the originally proposed, stream-stream collision scenario."}

Specifically, the\nCME was relatively slow (~600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary\ntype-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically\ndetected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not\nextend to kHz frequencies and disappeared ~5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end\ntime.

Nevertheless, they face\nsignificant experimental challenges, primarily because the energy scale\nassociated with the seesaw mechanism is too high to be directly probed in\nterrestrial experiments. In this paper, we explore the gravitational waves\n(GWs) generated via graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of seesaw\nparticles in the early Universe. Specifically, we compute the GW spectrum\nresulting from the decay of the Higgs triplet within the type-II seesaw model.\nOur results demonstrate that the resulting GW spectrum depends sensitively on\nthe mass of the Higgs triplet and its couplings to the Standard Model Higgs\ndoublet and the left-handed lepton doublet. The detection of such a\nhigh-frequency GW background could offer a unique experimental window into the\nseesaw mechanism and provide indirect evidence for its validity."}

Using an analogy with charged\nrotating soap bubbles, we demonstrate that charge contributes to the total\nangular momentum and affects the entropy-event horizon relationship. By\napplying the Gouy-Stodola theorem, we establish a consistent thermodynamic\nformulation for charged black holes, showing that the first law of\nthermodynamics remains valid in this context.

The portal between\nthe dark sector and the Standard Model is provided by a kinetic mixing between\nthe dark gauge symmetry, $SU(2)_X$, and the hypercharge, $U(1)_Y$, induced by a\ndimension-six operator. The dark-matter candidates, $X^\\pm$, are charged under\na custodial symmetry and therefore stable, while the mediator is a massive dark\nphoton, $Z_D$, mixing with the photon and the $Z$. We show how the observed\ndark-matter abundance can be reproduced via freeze-out or freeze-in, through\neither the kinetic mixing or the dark gauge interaction.

The transformer predicts the learned\ndipole amplitude and the leading order inclusive deep inelastic scattering\ncross section very accurately, allowing for efficient fitting of the initial\ncondition to the experimental data.
