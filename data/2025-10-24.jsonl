Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present a fully analytical framework that unifies weak-field and\nstrong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild\nspacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric,\neven-parity quasinormal mode with $\\ell=2$, $m=0$ and complex frequency\n$\\omega$. Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while\nkeeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent\nline-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a\nstatic observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic\nexpansion yields the familiar weak-field $1/b$ law with a ringdown-frequency\ncorrection that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere\nexpansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic\nstrong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small\noscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the\nbackground static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities like centroid\nmotion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, and photon-ring morphology are\ngauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing\nthat the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius\nmodulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field\ncorrection. The result is a coherent, purely theoretical account of how\nringdown physics imprints on imaging observables without numerical ray tracing."}

However, direct signatures of extra dimensions\nare difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if\nthe energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or\nGrand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting\nopportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with\nhigh-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK)\ngravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we\nillustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation\nand leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we\nconsider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized\nas inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an\nexplicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the\nradion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of\nfreedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature\nperturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory\nshape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which\ncan already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future.\nOur study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe\non-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years."}

To do\nso, we implemented a constraint-satisfying initial data solver based on the\npuncture method, we improved the accuracy of our open-source software Canuda to\neighth order finite differences, and we reduced the initial orbital\neccentricity. We investigate the impact of the scalar mass on the gravitational\nand scalar radiation. We find that binaries can undergo a delayed or an\naccelerated merger with respect to the vacuum. Our study highlights the\nchallenge and importance of accurately modeling black-hole binaries in dark\nmatter environments."}

It is based on the postulations\nthat quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints,\nrepresent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift\ngenerate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses\ntoward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the\nscale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,\nvector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of\ntime for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,\nthe tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra\nmodes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the\nconstraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over\nall length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave\nvector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations\nwith large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range\ninteractions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them\nundetectable without sufficient temporal resolution.

We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass\nlens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing\ndepends on cosmological distances, string tension $\\Delta$, and wavelength\n$\\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical\ngeometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent\nratio $\\sim M_{Lz}/\\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of\nthe lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers\nlensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating\npattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on\nthe string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS\nlensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a\nwide region of parameter space."}

In this work we challenge this view\nby analyzing a charged spherically symmetric black hole formed through\ngravitational collapse and evaporating via Hawking radiation. We show that the\nelectromagnetic repulsion and the violation of energy conditions due to the\npresence of Hawking radiation are be sufficient to avoid the formation of both\na singularity and a Cauchy horizon. We argue that a similar mechanism may apply\nto astrophysical black holes in which the role of the electric charge is\nreplaced by the angular momentum."}

However, is there\nany justification for avoiding time slices that cover inside the event horizon?\nTo answer the question, we investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, where the\ntime slices can cover both inside and outside the event horizon. We find that\none can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave\nfunction must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly\nsuggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface\nthat crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must\nkeep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the\nevent horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single\ncoherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a\nsuperposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a\nhorizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum\nmacroscopic object. We provide a synthetic approach to understanding the\ninformation loss paradox from this perspective."}

Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on\nstandard General Relativity or other modifications, this inclusion allows for a\nmodified entropy formulation, facilitating the computation of key thermodynamic\nquantities such as Gibbs free energy, the first law of thermodynamics, the\nequation of state, and Hawking temperature. We identify critical points and\ngraphically represent the relationship between temperature and Gibbs free\nenergy as a function of the horizon radius. Ultimately, we assess the thermal\nstability of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-AdS black hole within the framework of\nGauss-Bonnet gravity, emphasizing the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term unlike\nprevious studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other\nmodifications. As a result, it is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling\nsignificantly alters the thermodynamic behavior and stability structure of the\nblack hole, revealing richer phase transition phenomena."}

CSs, whose\ndetection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early\nUniverse, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a\ndedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission\nfactor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the\ncharacteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime\naround a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass\nlens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing\ndepends on cosmological distances, string tension $\\Delta$, and wavelength\n$\\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical\ngeometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent\nratio $\\sim M_{Lz}/\\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of\nthe lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers\nlensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating\npattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on\nthe string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS\nlensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a\nwide region of parameter space."}

At the final stage of the evolution of such\nsystems, the low-mass neutron star fills its Roche lobe, whereupon its mass is\ngradually transferred to the more massive component. At a certain point, the\nstability of the mass transfer is lost, causing the minimum-mass neutron star\nto explode. In the present stripping calculations, the effect of\nnon-conservative mass transfer has been taken into account for the first time,\nresulting in an increase in the duration of stable mass transfer from a few\ntenths of a second to a few seconds. This allows the time delay of 1.7 s\nbetween the loss of the gravitational-wave signal and the detection of the\ngamma-ray burst from the multimessenger event GW170817-GRB170817A to be\nnaturally explained. The interaction of the envelope of the exploded\nminimum-mass neutron star with the matter ejected during non-conservative mass\ntransfer may explain two episodes in the light curve of this gamma-ray burst."}
