Observation of this symmetry in the\nvacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies\nthat the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark\ncondensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are\nnot directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry\nrestoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with\nchirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining\nelectric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature\nT_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears\nsuggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a\nvery smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has\nbeen further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy\ndensity, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as\nN_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We\nhave analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above\nT_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid.\nWhen N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the\nthree-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally\nsymmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry\nrestoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet\nquark-antiquark systems that become very large at T > T_ch.
