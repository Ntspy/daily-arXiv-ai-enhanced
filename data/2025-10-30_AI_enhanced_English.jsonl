The case of a dipole magnetic\nfield is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a\nnotable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone.\nWithin the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in\nthe post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons, gained\nthe energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the\nthermal Doppler effect, are responsible for the formation of high-energy\nregions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a 3D numerical simulation of the radiation-dominated polar emission region in an accreting X-ray pulsar, incorporating various radiative processes like induced Compton scattering and cyclotron emission. It finds that induced Compton effects significantly influence electron temperature in post-shock zones, leading to higher temperatures than bulk-heating alone. The resulting photon interactions contribute to high-energy features in polarization spectra.", "motivation": "To understand how radiative processes, particularly induced Compton scattering and bulk Comptonization, affect electron temperature and photon energy distribution in accreting X-ray pulsars' shock regions, and their impact on observed polarization spectra.", "method": "A 2D geometric model with self-consistent radiative transfer calculations. Incorporates magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on photon energy/polarization, bulk Comptonization, induced scattering, polarization mode switching, free-free processes, cyclotron emission from electron-proton collisions, and realistic accretion channel geometry. Simulates a dipole magnetic field configuration.", "result": "Induced Compton scattering notably elevates electron temperature post-shock beyond bulk heating effects. Photons energized by shock bulk motion and thermal Doppler effects create high-energy regions in polarization mode spectra. The model reproduces key features of observed X-ray pulsar continua.", "conclusion": "Induced Compton effects are critical in post-shock thermal evolution, providing a mechanism to explain high-energy polarization features in X-ray pulsar spectra. The comprehensive model advances understanding of shock physics in strongly magnetized accretion systems."}}

These two types of experiments are complementary in that\nthey allow exploration of different parameter regions of a model. In our\nscenario, the presence of multiple massive gauge bosons as Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nparticles leads to an enhancement in the signal events compared to the\ncorresponding four-dimensional scenario. In particular, the decay process into\nmuon pairs enables mass reconstruction of the parent particle, making it\npossible to directly demonstrate the existence of multiple KK particles in at\nleast some parameter regions. This can provide clear evidence that the origin\nof the $U(1)_{L_\\mu - L_\\tau}$ interaction lies in five dimensions.\nFurthermore, the muon $(g-2)$ value, which is now consistent with the SM, can\nbe used to exclude specific parameter regions for new particles interacting\nwith muons.
