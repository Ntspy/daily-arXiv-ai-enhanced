However, their\ndetection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals'\ncomplexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search\nstrategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform\ntemplates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single\nmildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection\nstatistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is\nmodeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The\npipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency,\nenabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on\na single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at\n$\\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the\nfrequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping\nthe EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show\nthat the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision\nestimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a\ncomputationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the\nLISA global fit."}

Consequently,\nobservations and modeling of radiation produced by the interaction in various\ntypes of supernovae have provided valuable insights into their progenitors.\nDetailed studies have shown that the interaction in supernovae begins and\nsustains over various timescales and lengthscales, with differing mass-loss\nrates in distinct sub-classes. This reveals diverse progenitor histories for\nthese stellar explosions. This review paper summarizes various supernova\nsubtypes, linking them to stellar death pathways, and presents an updated\nsupernova classification diagram. We then present a multi-wavelength study of\ncircumstellar interaction in different supernova classes. We also present\nunpublished Chandra X-ray as well as radio observations of a type IIn\nsupernova, SN 2010jl, which allow us to extend its circumstellar interaction\nstudies to about 7 years post-explosion. The new data indicates that the\nextreme mass-loss rate 0.1 Msun/yr in SN 2010jl, reported by Chandra et al.\n(2015), commenced within the last 300 years before the explosion. We summarize\nthe current status of the field and argue that via detailed studies of the\ncircumstellar interaction, a.k.a.

Seven SD stations, configured with a centered-1-PMT\ndesign, are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with one station in the center,\nwith 1.5 km spacing, mirroring the Auger layout. The eighth station, which\nfeatures a standard 3-PMT Auger station, is located in conjunction with a TA\ndetector at the center of the hexagon, forming a triplet for high-statistics\nand low-uncertainty cross-calibration. A custom communication system that uses\nreadily available components enables seamless communication between stations\nand remote access to each station through a central computer.

We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and\nDrift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden.\nThe interaction of DKI and KHI generates qualitatively new structures, marked\nby a thickened shear layer with very weak electromagnetic field, modulated by\nKH vortices. Over a range of moderately strong velocity shears explored, the\ninteraction of DKI and KHI results in a significant enhancement of dissipation\nover cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we\nobserve a new and efficient way of particle acceleration where particles are\nstochastically accelerated by the motional electric field exterior to the shear\nlayer as they meander in an S-shaped pattern in and out of it. This process\ntakes advantage of the bent geometry of the shear layer caused by the DK-KHI\ninteraction and is responsible for most of the highest-energy particles\nproduced in our simulations. These results further our understanding of\ndissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures, which are\npresent in plasma turbulence across a wide range of astrophysical contexts such\nas in AGN jet sheaths, potentially relevant to limb-brightened emission, etc.,\nand highlight the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple interacting\ninstabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their\nnonlinear interaction at the kinetic level."}

They\noperate in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively, at similar\nlatitudes but with distinct surface detector (SD) designs. A significant\nchallenge in studying UHECR physics across the full sky is the apparent\ndiscrepancy in flux measurements between the two experiments. This discrepancy\ncould arise from astrophysical differences and/or systematic effects related to\ntheir detector designs and sensitivities to extensive air shower components. To\naddress this, the Auger@TA working group aims to cross-calibrate the two\nobservatories with a self-triggering micro-Auger array within the TA array.\nThis micro-array consists of eight Auger Surface Detector (SD) stations\nequipped with Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) and AugerPrime Surface\nScintillator Detectors. Seven SD stations, configured with a centered-1-PMT\ndesign, are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with one station in the center,\nwith 1.5 km spacing, mirroring the Auger layout. The eighth station, which\nfeatures a standard 3-PMT Auger station, is located in conjunction with a TA\ndetector at the center of the hexagon, forming a triplet for high-statistics\nand low-uncertainty cross-calibration. A custom communication system that uses\nreadily available components enables seamless communication between stations\nand remote access to each station through a central computer. The micro-array\nis now fully deployed, and initial data-taking is about to start. This\npresentation will detail the instrumentation, communication systems, central\ndata acquisition system, expected performance of the micro-array, and\npreliminary results as appropriate."}

However, their\ndetection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals'\ncomplexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search\nstrategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform\ntemplates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single\nmildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection\nstatistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is\nmodeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The\npipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency,\nenabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on\na single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at\n$\\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the\nfrequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping\nthe EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show\nthat the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision\nestimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a\ncomputationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the\nLISA global fit."}

Over the past\nfew decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable\nattention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$\nframework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members\nof the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to\ngeneral relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential\nastrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation\non the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and\ngravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry\nfollowed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate\nvalue, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all\nmembers) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN) BH. In its turn,\nfor a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe\ndiscrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those\nof the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius\nA$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the\ncharge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs."}
