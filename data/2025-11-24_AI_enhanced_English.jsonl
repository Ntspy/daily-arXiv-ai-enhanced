At the differential level, they are continuous global variables akin classical event shapes and $n\\to n+1$ jet-resolution parameters, which probe the geometry and hierarchical structure of the radiation in an event. At the integrated, cumulative level, they naturally define $n$ jet rates, providing a jet-multiplicity-based characterisation of multi-jet final states. Their definition applies to scattering processes with any number of resolved jets in the final state, as well as to groomed jets. They are thus usable as resolution variables in the context of higher-order calculations via phase-space slicing, matching fixed-order calculations to parton showers, and testing the logarithmic accuracy of shower algorithms. From a theoretical viewpoint, such observables feature a simple all-order structure and are free of non-global logarithmic corrections. As an initial application, we derive next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accurate predictions for processes with two QCD legs at $e e$, $pp$ and $e p$ colliders, and matched predictions to next-to-next-to-leading order for the LHC, discussing aspects of collider phenomenology.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Lund-Tree Shapes (LTS), a new class of collider observables derived from declustering trees in the Lund jet plane.

Although the coupling is too feeble to thermalize the ALP, coherent forward scattering between the two sectors induces temperature-dependent mass shifts that substantially modify both WIMP freeze-out and ALP misalignment dynamics, giving rise to a novel coherent freeze-out mechanism. At high temperatures, the WIMP thermal bath spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the ALP potential, displacing the field to a new vacuum. The resulting back-reaction reduces the WIMP effective mass and delays its freeze-out. Depending on the strength of the coupling, symmetry restoration occurs via either a first-order phase transition (FOPT) or a crossover. In the FOPT regime, dark matter consists solely of WIMPs, whose delayed freeze-out permits annihilation cross sections up to two (five) orders of magnitude above the standard value for $s$-wave ($p$-wave) annihilation, while still yielding the correct relic density. In the crossover regime, both WIMP and ALP can contribute to dark matter.

Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\\sim 2.1~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR~J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\\sim1\u03c3$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study demonstrates that even with significant underestimation of background components in X-ray data from NICER and XMM-Newton, neutron star radius estimates remain robust, showing only ~1\u03c3 deviation from true values when using accurate models.", "motivation": "To assess the impact of background model inaccuracies on neutron star radius measurements, a crucial but understudied systematic error, ensuring reliable density measurements of neutron star cores.", "method": "Synthetic data from NICER and XMM-Newton were analyzed using PSR J0740+6620 as a case study, comparing scenarios with correct versus underestimated background models.", "result": "Underestimating the background by up to fivefold caused only ~1\u03c3 radius shifts, and correct models showed higher Bayesian evidence.

To solve this problem, we present a flexible, data-driven method: the GausSian PIxelwise Conditional Estimator (GSPICE) that models an ensemble of spectra as a multivariate Gaussian and estimates the expected value and expected variance of each pixel in each spectrum conditional on others. GSPICE compares observed fluxes and errors to its own flux and error estimates to reveal outliers, which then can be completely masked or replaced by their estimates.

Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of more significant extinction and the exact evolutionary status of the supposed helium star is uncertain, by comparing J1928$+$1815 with other pulsar binaries, we propose a natural alternative solution: that J1928$+$1815 is a heavyweight black widow system with a massive ablated white dwarf. Due to the pulsar's relatively high spin-down power and short orbital separation, the irradiation heating timescale is uniquely shorter than the cooling timescale for the WD companion. As a result, the WD effectively boils, with its outer layers expanding, overfilling the Roche lobe and producing low-density binary-scale haze opaque in the radio band. If this interpretation is correct, J1928$+$1815 would represent a new category distinct from canonical lightweight black widow systems. Radio eclipses can occur in pulsar binaries across a wider range of WD companion masses than previously thought.

M. Keck I telescope that aims to deliver near diffraction-limited angular resolution at optical wavelengths. Our proposed architecture, the Keck Optical Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics System (KOLA), combines multiple laser guide stars (LGS) and deformable mirrors to enable wide-field correction across a 60 arcsecond field of view. Simulations were conducted using the open-source Multi-Threaded Adaptive Optics Simulator (MAOS), which we validated against on-sky data for the current Keck I adaptive optics system. We evaluated KOLA performance across a range of design parameters and report key point spread function metrics, including Strehl ratio, full width at half maximum, and encircled energy radius. Example science-driven requirements include resolving black hole spheres of influence, probing crowded stellar fields, and imaging protoplanetary disks. Trade studies on actuator count and laser guide star configuration help inform future design decisions. We present a nominal KOLA design (10 LGS, 3 tip-tilt natural guide stars (TTNGS), and 3600 actuators on the adaptive secondary mirror). Performance simulations show a 15 mas angular resolution with a Strehl ratio of 34% at 652 nm on-axis. More work is needed to explore alternative LGS/TTNGS asterisms, optimize conjugation heights for high-altitude deformable mirrors, and test performance under poorer seeing conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Ions were classified as thermal, suprathermal, or nonthermal, depending on the energy they achieved and the acceleration regime they fell under. These classifications were used to train deep learning models to predict which particles are injected into the acceleration process with high accuracy (>90%), using only time series of the local magnetic field they experienced during their initial interaction with the shock. An autoencoder architecture was also tested, for which time series of various parameters were reconstructed from encoded representations.

Observing many black holes over different timescales can enhance our chances of detecting variability coming from (partial) tidal disruption events, massive black hole binaries, changing state AGN, blazar activity and much more. X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries.
