In the former case we compare to the\nATLAS measurement of dielectron production and find that our predictions match\nthe data very well. In the latter case we show that this contribution is too\nsmall to explain the observed broad in diphoton acoplanarity background to the\npurely coherent light-by-light scattering signal. We in addition consider a new\n`quark emission' topology, which while naively might be expected to dominate\nthe incoherent diphoton production channel, is in fact found to be\nkinematically suppressed. Finally, we revisit QCD-initiated diphoton production\nand issue of theoretical uncertainties in this case. We find that this again\ncannot explain the observed size of the higher acoplanarity background. The\nproduction mechanism leading to this background to light-by-light production,\nand the reason for its observed enhancement in comparison to the dilepton case,\ntherefore remains unclear."}

Moreover, real-world\nexperiments may not exactly respect fundamental symmetries at the level of\nfinite granularities and energy thresholds. In this work, we explore an\nalternative approach to create symmetry-aware machine learning models. We\nintroduce soft constraints that allow the model to decide the importance of\nadded symmetries during the learning process instead of enforcing exact\nsymmetries. We investigate two complementary approaches, one that penalizes the\nmodel based on specific transformations of the inputs and one inspired by group\ntheory and infinitesimal transformations of the inputs.

Standard PTA\nanalyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can\nintroduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this\nlimitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise\npriors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the\nchallenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise\nparameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure\nvariations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal\nreparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows.\nWe also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore\nthe resulting higher-dimensional parameter space.

UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos\ndecouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d}\n\\approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann\nsuppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much\ngreater than $m_{\\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at\nfreeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for\nDM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying\nincompatibility with $\\Lambda$CDM, we show that when the approximation of\ninstantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and\naccount for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter\nspace. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo\nUFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative,\npost-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination. For some\ninteractions, such as a contact interaction between the Higgs and DM scalars,\nthere is a seamless transition between the WIMP and FIMP regimes which excludes\nUFO.

In this context, an accurate analysis of the optical emission,\nwhich is mostly dominated by the companion star, is essential for a\ncomprehensive characterization of these systems and their role within their\nenvironment. In this work, we present a multi-wavelength investigation of five\nbinary MSPs in the Galactic GC M3 (NGC 5272) using archival Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) data. Our analysis builds on the timing solutions obtained with\nthe FAST radio Telescope by Li et al. (2024). For each MSP, we carry out\nprecise astrometric cross-matching with the accurate radio positions to\nidentify potential counterparts. When a match is found, we analyse its location\nin the colour-magnitude diagrams and compare the results with updated binary\nevolution models to infer the system properties. We confirm the identification\nof the optical companion to M3B, matching the source previously reported by\nCadelano et al. (2019), and successfully identify and characterize the optical\ncompanions to M3D and M3F. All three are consistent with helium white dwarfs,\nas expected from the canonical formation scenario. For M3A and M3E, no reliable\ncounterparts are found, but we place strong upper limits on the brightness and\nmass of the undetected companion. In the case of M3E, we detect a red object\nnear the radio position in two F814W observations; however, astrometric\nmeasurements over a 15-year baseline reveal a significant proper motion\ninconsistent with cluster membership, identifying the source as a foreground\ncontaminant.

The\nDyson-Schwinger equation of the quark propagator is truncated using the\nMaris-Tandy model for the dressed gluon propagator, which incorporates both the\ninfrared enhancement and the perturbatively correct ultraviolet behavior.\nAdditionally, for the dressed quark-gluon vertex, we apply its bare form and\nthe Ball-Chiu model, which minimally satisfies the constraint imposed by the\ngauge symmetry through its Ward-Green-Takahashi identity. Consistent truncation\nof both Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson-Schwinger equations requires that axial-vector\nWard-Takahashi identity, arising from chiral symmetry of the Lagrangian of\nquantum chromodynamics, must not be violated. We utilize this identity as an\nadditional constraint to truncate the Bethe-Salpeter equation and examine the\nimpact of two choices of quark-gluon vertex, along with the application of the\nMaris-Tandy model on the light meson spectrum. To extract the masses of\nflavored and unflavored light mesons, we solve the inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter\nequation using the Pad$\\acute{e}$ approximation, which enables us to locate the\npoles of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude without requiring a numerical solution in\nthe timelike region of momentum space.

Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by\nlabeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr\nprograde fundamental modes.

The\ngeneralized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the\nRiemannian metric $\\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nrepresentation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a\nspecific relationship between the component of the one-form $\\beta$ and the\nconformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is\ndetermined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free\nparameter $\\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological\nmodels are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic\nChronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of\n$\\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is\nalso performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating\nBarthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple,\nalternative to standard cosmological models."}

We demonstrate that\nfits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically\npreferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also\nfind that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with\nthose of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits\nstruggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by\nlabeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr\nprograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with\nthe ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the\ndata better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When\nfitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the\ninclusion of a third mode, an ${(\\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone,\nimproves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of\ngeneral relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency\nspectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency\nand damping rate spectrum to within $\\pm10\\%$ at the 90$\\%$ credible level\nusing a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\\pm8\\%$ constraints using a\nmodel with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain.\nUnderstanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate\nanalyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary\nformation studies -- our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher\nremnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models\nincluding NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have\nastrophysical implications."}
