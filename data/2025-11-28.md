Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies relativistic tidal forces around a black hole with a cloud of strings, showing that tidal effects and orbital parameters evolve differently compared to traditional Schwarzschild scenarios due to parameters of the string cloud.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how a cloud of strings modifies relativistic tidal forces and geodesic motion around a black hole, extending beyond standard Schwarzschild solutions by examining the generalized Letelier-Alencar spacetime.

Method: The authors analyze the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution by calculating the Kretschmann scalar to assess curvature divergence, studying photon and massive particle geodesics (including circular orbits and radial infall), computing tidal forces, and examining their behavior under varying parameters g_s and l_s.

Result: Key findings include increased photon sphere and innermost stable orbit radii with g_s, decreased radii with l_s, parameter-dependent nonexistence of circular orbits, tidal force inversion in radial motion (often within the horizon), and modified tidal profiles/circular Keplerian frequencies influenced by the cloud of strings even at large distances without tidal component sign changes.

Conclusion: The cloud of strings significantly alters black hole dynamics, affecting tidal forces and orbital characteristics, suggesting observable differences from standard black hole metrics and highlighting the importance of string cloud parameters in relativistic astrophysics.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate relativistic tidal forces around a black hole sourced by a cloud of strings, described by the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution. We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.

### [2] [Cosmological Probes of Lepton Parity Freeze-in Dark Matter: $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ & Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21634)
*Ernest Ma,Partha Kumar Paul,Narendra Sahu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework in the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism where a Majorana fermion S with lepton parity becomes a dark matter candidate. The DM relic can be produced through two channels depending on reheating temperatures, and the model offers observable imprints like gravitational waves and modified relativistic degrees of freedom.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore a viable dark matter candidate within the type-I seesaw model while addressing production mechanisms and observable signatures that can be tested experimentally.

Method: The method involves introducing a lepton parity even Majorana fermion S and a scalar σ. The relic density is calculated via two DM production channels: right-handed neutrino decay (for high reheating temperatures) and Higgs decay (for lower temperatures). The impact of σ-higgs interactions on electroweak phase transitions and late-time decays is analyzed.

Result: The model allows a DM mass range from MeV to TeV and predicts detectable signals through gravitational waves (from phase transitions) and ΔNeff (from σ decays), offering complementary experimental probes.

Conclusion: The framework provides a versatile mechanism for dark matter within seesaw models, with observable consequences that can be tested by future gravitational wave and cosmic microwave background experiments.

Abstract: In the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses, a residual symmetry known as lepton parity: $(-1)^L$, remains preserved. Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $σ$ allows for the coupling $N S σ$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\rm rh}>m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\rightarrow Sσ$), and (ii) for $T_{\rm EW}<T_{\rm rh}\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $σ-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\langleσ\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $σ-h$ coupling is small, then $σ$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($σ\rightarrow Sν$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($Δ{N}_{\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $Δ{N}_{\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.

### [3] [Updated bounds on the (1,2) neutrino oscillation parameters after first JUNO results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21650)
*Francesco Capozzi,Eligio Lisi,Francesco Marcone,Antonio Marrone,Antonio Palazzo*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper updates the bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters δm² and sin²θ₁₂ using latest SNO+ and JUNO data, reducing uncertainties to 1.3% and 2.4% respectively. Future experiments may resolve mass-ordering degeneracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine the precision of neutrino oscillation parameters δm² and sin²θ₁₂ beyond previous estimates using new experimental constraints.

Method: Conducted a global analysis incorporating updated SNO+ constraints and initial JUNO results to re-evaluate parameter uncertainties with improved statistical and systematic precision.

Result: Obtained updated parameters: δm² = 7.48±0.10×10⁻⁵ eV² and sin²θ₁₂ = 0.3085±0.0073, with reduced uncertainties compared to 2024 analysis.

Conclusion: Current measurements set tighter constraints on neutrino parameters, with future studies needing to address residual degeneracies for further improvements.

Abstract: Within the standard $3ν$ framework, we discuss updated bounds on the leading oscillation parameters related to the $(ν_1,\,ν_2)$ states, namely, the squared mass difference $δm^2=m^2_2-m^2_1$ and the mixing parameter $\sin^2θ_{12}$. A previous global analysis of 2024 oscillation data estimated $δm^2$ and $\sin^2θ_{12}$ with fractional $1σ$ errors of about $2.3\%$ and $4.5\%$, respectively. First we update the analysis by applying the latest SNO+ constraints, that slightly shift the $(δm^2,\,\sin^2θ_{12})$ best fits. Then we apply the constraints placed by the first JUNO results, that significantly reduce the uncertainties of both parameters. Our updated global bounds (as of 2025) can be summarized as: $δm^2/10^{-5}{\rm eV}^2 = 7.48\pm 0.10$ and $\sin^2θ_{12}=0.3085\pm0.0073$ (with correlation $ρ=-0.20$), corresponding to $1σ$ uncertainties as small as $1.3\%$ and $2.4\%$, respectively. We also comment on minor physical and statistical effects that, in the future, may contribute to lift the current mass-ordering degeneracy of $(δm^2,\,θ_{12})$ estimates.
