### [1] [High-energy radiation from the pulsar Equatorial Current Sheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20682)
*Ioannis Contopoulos,Jerome Petri,Ioannis Dimitropoulos*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method to study pulsar high-energy radiation by analyzing the Equatorial Current Sheet (ECS) using ideal force-free solutions and considering dissipation effects. The method generates realistic sky maps that align with PIC simulations and suggests the ECS's stabilization via magnetospheric reconnection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainties in existing PIC simulations and validate their extrapolation to realistic pulsar parameters. The motivation is to accurately model high-energy radiation origins in neutron star magnetospheres through first-principles approaches.

Method: 1. Determine ECS shape and external magnetic field using steady-state ideal force-free solutions. 2. Incorporate extra field components from dissipation effects. 3. Simulate particle acceleration/radiation under realistic field/particle parameters. 4. Generate and compare sky maps with PIC results, showing ECS stability via split-monopole solution beyond the light cylinder.

Result: Sky maps produced match PIC simulations and reveal ECS stability from magnetospheric reconnection's normal magnetic field component. This validates the method's effectiveness in explaining pulsed high-energy radiation mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a reliable framework for understanding pulsar magnetospheric physics, clarifying how particle acceleration and radiation arise from ECS dynamics stabilized by global magnetic processes.

Abstract: Pulsars emit beams of radiation that reveal the extreme physics of neutron star magnetospheres. Yet, their understanding remains incomplete. Recent global Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations have raised several questions that led us to question their validity and their extrapolation to realistic particle Lorentz factors, electric and magnetic fields. We want to generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation from first principles. We propose a novel method to study the Equatorial Current Sheet (ECS) where most of the particle acceleration and the high-energy radiation is expected to originate. We first determine its shape and external magnetic field with a steady-state ideal force-free solution. Then, we consider the extra electric and magnetic field components that develop when dissipation is considered. Finally, we study the particle acceleration and radiation that is due to these extra field components for realistic field and particle parameters. We generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation and compare them with those obtained via PIC simulations. These sky maps may also be closely reproduced using the ECS of the split-monopole solution beyond the light cylinder. The ECS is probably stabilized by the normal magnetic field component that is due to the global magnetospheric reconnection. Our method helps us better understand the origin of the pulsed high-energy radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere.

### [2] [From Observations to Simulations: A Neural-Network Approach to Intracluster Medium Kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20755)
*E. Gatuzz,J. ZuHone,J. S. Sanders,A. Fabian,A. Liu,C. Pinto,S. Walker*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network to compare observed galaxy cluster velocity maps with simulations, finding that ICM dynamics result from sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor mergers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain the physical conditions and dynamical states of the intracluster medium (ICM) via a data-driven comparison between observational data and simulations.

Method: A Siamese CNN was developed to match observed velocity maps from XMM-Newton (for four clusters) with synthetic maps from TNG-300 simulations, focusing on morphology comparison to identify analogous systems.

Result: The best-matching simulations reproduce observed velocity gradients and substructures, attributing ICM motions to gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor mergers.

Conclusion: Deep learning effectively links X-ray observations to simulations, providing new insights into cluster dynamics and ICM turbulence drivers.

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison between {\it XMM-Newton} velocity maps of the Virgo, Centaurus, Ophiuchus and A3266 clusters and synthetic velocity maps generated from the Illustris TNG-300 simulations. Our goal is to constrain the physical conditions and dynamical states of the intracluster medium (ICM) through a data-driven approach. We employ a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify the most analogous simulated cluster to each observed system based on the morphology of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests. We find that the best-matching simulated halos reproduce the observed large-scale velocity gradients and local kinematic substructures, suggesting that the ICM motions in these clusters arise from a combination of gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor merger activity. Our results demonstrate that deep learning provides a powerful and objective framework for connecting X-ray observations to cosmological simulations, offering new insights into the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters and the mechanisms driving turbulence and bulk flows in the hot ICM.

### [3] [High-Order Photon Rings around Kerr Naked Singularities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20756)
*Hina Suzuki,Yosuke Mizuno,Akhil Uniyal,Indu Kalpa Dihingia,Tintin Nguyen,Chi-kwan Chan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes higher-order photon rings of an accreting Kerr naked singularity (KNS) with a spin parameter a=1.01, comparing its observational signatures to Kerr black holes. It highlights morphological differences like a pronounced shadow gap at high inclinations and measurable visibility deviations, suggesting these features can test general relativity and distinguish KNS from black holes with future VLBI missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by horizon-scale VLBI observations (e.g., EHT and BHEX), the study aims to identify observable differences between KNS and Kerr black holes to test general relativity and the existence of event horizons.

Method: The researchers analyzed image morphology and interferometric visibilities of a spinning KNS (a=1.01). They computed photon ring structures, shadow properties, and visibility curves under varying observer inclinations.

Result: Key findings include photon rings concentrated within the shadow region, a visible gap in the shadow at high inclinations, and significant visibility deviations from Kerr black holes at horizon-resolving baselines.

Conclusion: The results propose that photon ring structure and visibility diagnostics can directly test for the presence of event horizons, offering a path to validate general relativity through upcoming observations like BHEX.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of higher-order photon rings of an accreting Kerr naked singularity (KNS) with dimensionless spin parameter $a=1.01$; i.e., a horizonless, overly spinning compact object. Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal ``shadow'' region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations.

### [4] [The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models: II. Quasi-Equipartition and the Impact of Various Angular Reconstruction Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20767)
*Tianshu Wang,Adam Burrows*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates fast flavor conversion (FFC) in 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova simulations, comparing angular reconstruction methods and neutrino transport schemes. FFC has minimal hydrodynamic impact but can be approximated with a 'quasi-equipartition' method for neutrino signals with low errors (≤2% in 1D, ≤10% in 2D).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand FFC's role in CCSN dynamics and develop a computationally efficient approximation for neutrino property estimation without full FFC simulations.

Method: Compared FFC effects in 1D and 2D CCSN models using different angular reconstructions and 3/4-species neutrino transport. Derived and tested the quasi-equipartition approximation on post-processed neutrino data.

Result: FFC effects are insensitive to tested methods and minimally alter hydrodynamics. The quasi-equipartition method achieves ≤2% error in 1D and ≤10% in 2D for luminosities, offering a simplified implementation alternative.

Conclusion: FFC can be effectively approximated using the quasi-equipartition method, enabling cost-effective inclusion of FFC effects in neutrino signal analysis without complex simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we explore in a consistent fashion the effects of fast flavor conversion (FFC) in 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. In addition, we investigate the impact of various angular reconstruction methods and compare the ``3-species'' and ``4-species'' neutrino transport schemes. We find that the FFC effects are insensitive to the different methods tested and that the FFC alters supernova hydrodynamics is only minor ways. We also present a ``quasi-equipartition'' approximation which can be used to estimate the FFC-altered neutrino properties by post-processing the neutrino signals extracted from no-oscillation CCSN simulations. The relative errors in neutrino number and energy luminosities of this phenomenological method are less than 2\% for 1D models, and less than 10\% for 2D models. This method provides a simple way to include the effects of FFC on neutrino signals without implementing a complex and expensive FFC scheme or redoing simulations.

### [5] [Is there a retrograde accretion disk around 4U 1626$-$67? Tracking torque reversals with a state-space model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20847)
*Joseph O'Leary,Andrew Melatos,Tom Kimpson,Dimitris M. Christodoulou,Nicholas J. O'Neill,Patrick M. Meyers,Sayantan Bhattacharya,Silas G. T. Laycock*

TL;DR: Summary generation failed

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: X-ray timing studies of the persistent, Galactic, accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1626$-$67 reveal torque reversals, during which the pulse frequency $ν(t)$ alternates between multiyear episodes of secular acceleration and deceleration, separated by transitions lasting $\lesssim 150 \, \rm{days}$. Here an unscented Kalman filter is applied to track the $ν(t)$ fluctuations observed in 22.7 years (3340 samples) of publicly available Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory and Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope data to test the canonical picture of magnetocentrifugal accretion for consistency with prograde-prograde and retrograde-prograde accretion disk configurations on either side of the 2008 torque reversal. It is found that the retrograde-prograde model is preferred, with a log Bayes factor equal to 0.44 and maximum a posteriori log likelihood ratio equal to 2.5. The mass accretion rate $Q(t)$ and magnetocentrifugal fastness $ω(t)$ transition smoothly between episodes of deceleration and acceleration; $Q(t)$ shifts by $\leq 0.34 \, {\rm dex}$ across the reversal, and one measures $ω(t) \approx 0.25$ and $ω(t) \approx 0.30$ during deceleration and acceleration, respectively. The angular acceleration $\dotΩ(t)$ satisfies $-9 \lesssim \dotΩ(t)/(10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}) \lesssim -5$ and $2 \lesssim \dotΩ(t)/(10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}) \lesssim 9$ before and after the 2008 reversal, respectively, compared to $\dotΩ \approx -3.0 \times 10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}$ before reversal and $\dotΩ \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}$ after reversal, as inferred from previous long-term X-ray timing and spectral analysis of 4U 1626$-$67.

### [6] [The Intermediate Mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri: Constraints on Accretion from JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20945)
*Steven Chen,Jeremy Hare,Oleg Kargaltsev,Hui Yang,Denis Cioffi,Maximilian Häberle,Anil Seth*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper uses JWST observations to analyze the central region of ω Cen near a proposed IMBH candidate, finding no evidence of IMBH accretion in UV/IR SEDs. Non-detection refines constraints on IMBH mass and accretion efficiency without conflicting with HST-based mass estimates, suggesting deeper observations are needed for stronger conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the existence of an IMBH in ω Cen’s core by searching for accretion signatures via JWST, following HST kinematic evidence from Haberle et al. 2024a.

Method: Performed PSF-fitting photometry with JWST/NIRCam and MIRI data, combined with HST oMEGACat photometry to create SEDs of central region stars. Compared SEDs against IMBH accretion models from Pesce et al. 2021.

Result: No IMBH SED signatures detected. JWST constraints on IMBH mass/accretion efficiency are tighter than radio limits below ~20,000 M☉. Non-detection aligns with HST’s mass estimate range, but emission could mimic nearby starlight.

Conclusion: JWST observations constrain low-accretion IMBH scenarios but require better localization, deeper data, and intracluster medium measurements for definitive confirmation.

Abstract: We analyze JWST observations of the central region of the globular cluster $ω$ Centauri (NGC 5139, $ω$ Cen hereafter), around the position of the candidate IMBH inferred by Haberle et al. (2024a) from the motion of fast-moving stars in multi-epoch HST observations. We performed PSF-fitting photometry for sources in NIRCam (F200W and F444W) and MIRI (F770W and F1500W) and constructed UV to IR SEDs for sources within the central region of the cluster by using HST photometry from oMEGACat (Haberle et al. 2024b). None of the SEDs of reliably measured sources within this region resembles the SEDs computed from models of Pesce et al. 2021 for IMBHs accreting from intracluster medium at low rates. Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses $\lesssim 20,000 M_{\odot}$. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star. Tighter limits on accretion onto the candidate IMBH can be placed with deeper observations, a more precise localization of the IMBH, and better measurements of the local intracluster medium density and temperature at the center of the cluster.

### [7] [The diverse morphology of gravitational wave signals from merging neutron-star white-dwarf binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20970)
*Shenghua Yu,Youjun Lu,C. Simon Jeffery,Zhanwen Han,DongDong Liu,Jie Yang,Xilong Fan,Bo Peng,Jianbin Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the orbital evolution of neutron star-white dwarf binaries, showing how mass transfer dynamics and gravitational waves lead to branched evolutionary paths and diverse detectable gravitational wave signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the critical factors determining the evolution of NSWD binaries, particularly the role of angular momentum exchange and gravitational wave effects, and to provide models for detecting their gravitational wave signals.

Method: Computed orbital evolution across a broad parameter space incorporating four key variables affecting mass transfer and gravitational wave emission, analyzing outcomes in a mass-mass diagram.

Result: Identified distinct mass thresholds in NS-WD systems where binaries above these coalesce rapidly; revealed branched evolutionary pathways and diverse gravitational wave signals detectable by space observatories.

Conclusion: NSWD binaries exhibit polymorphic evolution leading to varied merger outcomes, and their gravitational waveforms can diagnose system parameters, aiding real-time detection with provided waveform templates.

Abstract: In sufficiently compact neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) binary systems, orbital decay means the white dwarf eventually fills its shrinking Roche lobe, initiating a phase of mass transfer. The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data.

### [8] [Impact of Cosmic Ray Distribution on the Growth and Saturation of Bell Instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21154)
*Saikat Das,Siddhartha Gupta,Prateek Sharma*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines how different cosmic ray (CR) momentum distributions—mono-energetic and power-law—affect the growth and saturation of the nonresonant streaming instability (NRSI). Key findings include that linear growth is uniform across distributions but saturation varies: mono-energetic CRs efficiently amplify magnetic fields through isotropization, while power-law distributions see low-energy CRs drive saturation, leaving high-energy CRs mostly unaffected. A new saturation model and a layered CR-confinement scenario for astrophysical shocks are proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how CR momentum distributions influence magnetic field amplification via NRSI, critical for modeling cosmic ray acceleration in astrophysical shocks.

Method: 1D kinetic simulations analyzing mono-energetic vs power-law CR distributions' impact on NRSI growth and saturation dynamics.

Result: Linear growth rate independent of CR distribution; saturation dominated by CR isotropization. Mono-energetic CRs maximize field amplification. For power-law CRs, low-energy particles drive saturation, preserving high-energy CR anisotropy. Revised saturation model and layered confinement concept introduced.

Conclusion: CR distribution significantly affects NRSI saturation mechanisms, with implications for magnetic field generation and particle acceleration in environments like supernova remnants. Proposed models improve understanding of high-energy cosmic ray propagation and acceleration.

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) streaming in weakly magnetized plasmas can drive large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations via nonresonant streaming instability (NRSI), or Bell instability. Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies.

### [9] [Broad-band temporal and spectral study of TeV blazar TXS 0518+211](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21182)
*Avik Kumar Das,Pankaj Kushwaha,Veeresh Singh,Goldy Ahuja,Deekshya R. Sarkar*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes a 16-year multi-wavelength dataset of TXS 0518+211, identifying 11 flux variability epochs. X-rays showed higher variability than other bands with weak correlations between bands. Notable exceptions include an X-ray orphan flare in Epoch-I and an unaccompanied X-ray dip in Epoch-K. A two-zone leptonic model best explains the emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the temporal and spectral variability of the TeV BL Lac object TXS 0518+211 using simultaneous optical/UV/X-ray/gamma-ray data over a long period to understand jet emission mechanisms.

Method: Analyzed 16-year Swift/XRT/UVOT and Fermi-LAT light curves divided into 11 epochs. Performed fractional variability analysis, flux-flux correlations, and two-zone leptonic modeling.

Result: X-rays exhibited higher fractional variability than other bands. Flux correlations were weak (0.29-0.58). Epoch-I had an X-ray flare without optical/UV counterparts. Epoch-K showed an X-ray dip without counterparts. Two-zone models fit all epochs well.

Conclusion: The jet emission in TXS 0518+211 shows complex, non-simultaneous variability patterns across bands, requiring a two-zone leptonic model to explain the broadband emission characteristics observed.

Abstract: We present a long-term broad-band temporal and spectral study of a TeV BL Lac source TXS 0518+211 by analyzing nearly 16 years (MJD 54682 -- 60670) of simultaneous optical, UV and X-ray light curves from Swift-XRT/UVOT and gamma-ray light curves from Fermi-LAT. Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands. Overall, our study reveals several changes in the flux states and complex nature of jet dominated emission processes. In all the epochs, two-zone leptonic model provides a better description of the broad-band emission in this TeV BL Lac source.

### [10] [The Faintest, Extremely Variable X-ray Tidal Disruption Event from a Supermassive Black Hole Binary?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21243)
*Mengqiu Huang,Yongquan Xue,Shuo Li,Fukun Liu,Shifu Zhu,Jin-Hong Chen,Rong-Feng Shen,Yibo Wang,Yi Yang,Ning Jiang,Franz Erik Bauer,Cristian Vignali,Fan Zou,Jialai Wang,Alexei V.

Brink,Tinggui Wang,Weikang Zheng,Xinwen Shu,Xuechen Zheng,Xiaozhi Lin,Xu Kong,Yijun Wang,Yibin Luo,Zheyu Lin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, detected in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, showing an X-ray dimming over 17 years with a sharp 2-month luminosity spike. The event's faintness and light curve behavior challenge existing TDE models, suggesting the need for SMBH binary TDE models but highlighting unresolved discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the nature of the peculiar X-ray transient XID 935, which exhibits non-monotonic dimming and a faint luminosity peak, pushing the limits of current tidal disruption event (TDE) understanding and models.

Method: Analysis of 20-year X-ray light curves from deep Chandra observations, comparing observed data with partial TDE and SMBH binary TDE models.

Result: The partial TDE model fails to explain the main decline, while the SMBH binary TDE model matches the general trend but not short-term fluctuations. XID 935's peak flux is the faintest among X-ray-selected TDE candidates.

Conclusion: XID 935's unique properties serve as a critical test case for improving TDE models and simulations, particularly those involving SMBH binaries and faint TDEs.

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs), which occur when stars enter the tidal radii of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and are subsequently torn apart by their tidal forces, represent intriguing phenomena that stimulate growing research interest and pose an increasing number of puzzles in the era of time-domain astronomy. Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $> 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}<10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}=10^{42.31\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations.

### [11] [Probing the Nature of High-Redshift Long GRB 250114A and Its Magnetar Central Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21419)
*Wen-Yuan Yu,Hou-Jun Lü,Xiao Tian,Liang-Jun Chen,En-Wei Liang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes GRB 250114A, a high-redshift long GRB, and proposes a magnetar central engine with inferred magnetic field and spin parameters. The X-ray afterglow and prompt emission features are compared to other high-redshift GRBs, showing no significant differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complex light curves and persistent X-ray activity during quiescent periods in GRB 250114A suggest a long-lived central engine, motivating the investigation of magnetar models over traditional collapsar scenarios.

Method: The authors fitted the X-ray light curve to magnetar-powered models to derive central engine parameters. They also performed comparative analysis of prompt emission, afterglow properties, and spectral correlations (E_p-E_iso, epsilon distributions) with other high-z GRBs.

Result: Magnetar parameters inferred: B_p ~1.3x10^16 G and P0 ~14 ms. The GRB's properties align statistically with other high-redshift GRBs, supporting magnetar engines across diverse populations.

Conclusion: GRB 250114A's behavior is consistent with magnetar-driven activity, indicating such engines can power long GRBs even at high redshifts. The findings strengthen magnetar models as viable explanations for diverse GRB populations.

Abstract: GRB 250114A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) which triggered the Swift/BAT with a spectroscopic high-redshift at $z = 4.732$. The light curve of the prompt emission is composed of three distinct emission episodes, which are separated by quiescent gaps ranging from tens to hundreds of seconds. While the X-ray light curve exhibits the canonical X-ray emission which is composed of several power-law segments superposition of a giant X-ray flare. More interestingly, there is still significant X-ray emission during the quiescent time in the prompt emission, suggesting a continuously active central engine whose power fluctuates across the $γ$-ray detectability threshold. In this paper, we propose a magnetar as the central engine of GRB 250114A by fitting the X-ray light curve, and infer a magnetic field strength $B_{\rm p}=13.24^{+1.73}_{-5.84} \, \times10^{15}\ \mathrm{G}$ and an initial spin period $P_{0}=14.31^{+0.93}_{-3.16} \, \mathrm{ms}$ of magnetar, with a jet correction, fall within a reasonable range. Furthermore, we also compare the prompt emission, X-ray afterglow, $E_{\mathrm p}$-$E_{γ,\mathrm{iso}}$, and $\varepsilon-$distribution of GBR 250114A with those of other high-$z$ sample-GRBs, and find no significant statistical differences between them.

### [12] [Compton-induced $γ$-ray Cascade Emissions in Radio Galaxy NGC 1275](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21463)
*Mfuphi Ntshatsha,Markus Böttcher,Soebur Razzaque*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that cascade γ-rays from inverse-Compton scattering of relativistic electron-positron pairs in the radio galaxy NGC 1275 can explain its observed HE-VHE emission, using refined Monte Carlo simulations to fit 2022-2023 flaring SEDs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historically, radio galaxies were not detected in HE-VHE γ-rays, but recent observations require explanation. The goal is to validate cascade models for misaligned AGN and reconcile NGC 1275's observations with theoretical predictions.

Method: Monte-Carlo tracking of photons and e± pairs in NGC 1275's environment, incorporating BLR and anisotropic SS disk radiation fields with mild magnetic fields. Parameters were optimized by fitting the SED of 2022-2023 flaring events.

Result: Cascade γ-rays from e± pairs scattering off external radiation fields successfully explain Fermi-LAT and MAGIC observations of NGC 1275. Plausible model parameters are derived from SED fitting during flaring periods.

Conclusion: Cascade processes in misaligned AGN like NGC 1275 are viable mechanisms for HE-VHE emission, supporting unified models linking blazars and radio galaxies through orientation effects.

Abstract: Among active galactic nuclei (AGNi), blazars are the brightest emitters of high-energy (HE, $E \geq 100$ MeV) to very-high-energy (VHE, $E \geq 100$ GeV) $γ$-rays from their jets. Radio galaxies, being the misaligned parent population of the blazar class, were historically not detected at these frequencies. However, advances in experiments and observatories have led to their detection in the HE--VHE $γ$-ray band. In this work, we leverage and refine a Monte-Carlo photon and electron-positron (e$^\pm$) pair tracking code in the AGN environment of the radio galaxy NGC 1275. In the code, we consider the isotropic broad-line region (BLR) and anisotropic Shakura-Sunyaev (SS) accretion disk radiation fields, with mild magnetic fields in the AGN environment. We find that cascade $γ$-rays from inverse-Compton scattering by relativistic e$^\pm$ pairs of these external radiation fields can explain the Fermi Large Area Telescope's (LAT) and Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment's observations from the radio galaxy NGC 1275. We present a set of plausible parameters obtained from the code by fitting the source's spectral energy distribution (SED) during flaring events reported during the period December 2022 to January 2023.

### [13] [The Feasibility of Using Fe XXIII Metastable Transitions as a Density Diagnostic for LMXB Disk Winds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21501)
*D. L. Moutard,L. R. Corrales,R. Tomaru,C. Done,J. Neilsen,E. Behar,E. Costantini,M. Díaz-Trigo,S. Yamada*

TL;DR: This paper explores using Fe XXIII absorption features to determine the density of outflows in LMXBs, finding applicability in BH systems with specific ionization parameters and densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the geometry, dynamics, and energetics of accretion in LMXBs by determining the location of disk winds through density diagnostics.

Method: Simulations with the photoionization code Pion, varying ionizing spectra based on three LMXBs (GX~13$+$1, 4U 1735$-$44, MAXI J1820$+$070) to test detectability of Fe XXIII features as density diagnostics.

Result: Fe XXIII is viable as a density diagnostic at ionization parameters log(ξ)=2-3 and densities log(n_H/cm⁻³)≥14, more feasible in BH LMXBs due to their typical ionization parameters.

Conclusion: The method offers a tool to study outflows in BH LMXBs, but may be less applicable to NS systems due to differing ionization conditions.

Abstract: Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) occasionally show signs of outflowing material from the accretion disk. Studying these outflows can inform the understanding of the geometry of the systems, as well as the dynamics and energetics of accretion. One key variable for determining the location of these disk winds is the density of the outflowing material. In this paper we explore a density diagnostic based upon the absorption of ionizing photons by density-sensitive metastable states of Fe XXIII. This can yield a blue shifted complex of absorption features in the region of $6.61-6.64$ keV. We use the photoionization code {\sc pion} to test how varying the ionizing spectrum affects the detectability and interpretation of these features. We base these ionizing spectral energy distributions on GX~13$+$1 to represent a bright thermally dominated spectrum; 4U 1735$-$44 representing a harder, fainter LMXB spectrum; and MAXI J1820$+$070 representing a black hole LMXB spectrum completely dominated by Comptonized emission. For each of these, we find that the regime where Fe XXIII can be used as a density diagnostic is with an ionization parameter $\log{(ξ/{\rm erg~cm~s^{-1}})}\sim2-3$ and an outflow density $\log{(n_H/{\rm cm^{-3})}}\gtrsim14$. The typical range of ionization parameters for LMXBs indicates that this technique is more feasibly achieved with BH LMXBs than their NS counterparts.

*Francesco Carenini,Matteo Cerruti*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the theoretical connection between photon and neutrino emissions from blazars, specifically focusing on High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), by extending neutrino flux templates using the LeHa-Paris code and applying them to a subset of HBLs from the 3HSP catalogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building on the discovery linking blazar TXS 0506+056's gamma-ray flare to a high-energy neutrino, the study aims to deepen understanding of neutrino production mechanisms in blazars and develop models applicable to HBLs.

Method: Using the LeHa-Paris code to simulate proton-photon interactions and radiative processes in HBLs, starting with PKS 2155-304 as a reference, then creating and optimizing neutrino flux templates for other HBLs in the 3HSP catalogue.

Result: Neutrino emission models for a subset of HBLs are derived, providing insights into hadronic processes and aiding in the interpretation of future high-energy neutrino observations.

Conclusion: The methodology establishes a framework to analyze neutrino emission across HBLs, supporting multi-messenger astrophysics efforts and identification of cosmic neutrino sources.

Abstract: The identification of astrophysical sources responsible for high-energy cosmic neutrinos has long been a challenge. A significant milestone was achieved with the blazar TXS 0506+056, which was found to be in a flaring state of high gamma-ray emission and associated at the 3$σ$ level with a 290 TeV neutrino detected by IceCube in September 2017. This discovery motivated deeper exploration of the theoretical link between photon and neutrino emissions. In this context, simulations of proton-photon interactions in blazars and radiative processes are conducted using advanced numerical codes to predict neutrino spectra. The LeHa-Paris code, previously applied to TXS 0506+056, enables the computation of both leptonic and hadronic components of blazar spectral energy distributions, facilitating exploration of a broad parameter space. In this work, starting from the case of PKS 2155-304, one of the brightest and most studied High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), known for its extreme variability and subject of multi-wavelength observational campaigns, a methodology has been developed to extend neutrino flux templates, optimized via LeHa-Paris, to the full class of HBLs. Afterwards, neutrino emission models for a subset of HBLs from the 3HSP catalogue are derived.

### [15] [Enhanced antineutrino emission from $β$ decay in core-collapse supernovae with self-consistent weak decay rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21567)
*T. Dasher,A. Ravlić,S. Lalit,E. O'Connor,K. Godbey*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study is the first to include β decay rates from microscopic theory in core-collapse supernova simulations, significantly boosting antineutrino emissivity and luminosity, which could improve our understanding of stellar death dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior CCSNe studies ignored β decays, focusing only on electron captures. This gaps creates uncertainties in weak-interaction effects during late stellar collapse.

Method: The authors used relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation to compute comprehensive β decay and electron capture rates for CCSNe simulations.

Result: Including β decay rates increased antineutrino emissivity by over 4 orders of magnitude and luminosity by 3 orders of magnitude compared to previous models.

Conclusion: These enhanced rates offer a path to constrain weak-interaction uncertainties, refine antineutrino signal predictions, and better model late-stage massive star evolution.

Abstract: Nuclear weak-interaction rates are known to exert a prominent effect in the late-stages of stellar collapse. Despite their importance, most studies to date on core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have focused primarily on the effects of electron captures, generally neglecting $β$ decay contributions. In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $β$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $β$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $β$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars.

### [16] [Causal Rigidity and the Single-Unit Universe: Integrating the Alexandrov-Zeeman and Unruh Clock Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20728)
*Karl Svozil*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper unifies two perspectives on relativistic spacetime by showing that a single fundamental constant suffices, combining the MPSV operational approach with Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems to establish a unique metric through clock normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the operational argument favoring one fundamental constant with mathematical theorems showing conformal indeterminacy, clarifying the relationship between spacetime structure and fundamental constants.

Method: Combines MPSV's operational requirement of a 'bona fide clock' with Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems to demonstrate that a single clock's worldline normalization breaks conformal dilation symmetry, fixing the metric uniquely.

Result: Proves that only one fundamental constant is necessary by showing clock normalization selects a unique metric from a conformal class, aligning operational and mathematical viewpoints.

Conclusion: Spacetime geometry is uniquely determined by light-cone structure plus a single clock's normalization, confirming the exact count of one fundamental constant.

Abstract: We unify two complementary viewpoints on relativistic spacetime and the counting of fundamental constants. Operationally, Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, and Vanzella (MPSV) have recently argued that relativistic spacetime requires only a single fundamental dimensional constant. Mathematically, theorems due to Alexandrov and Zeeman demonstrate that the light-cone structure determines the spacetime geometry only up to a conformal factor. We show that these approaches are mutually reinforcing: the Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems establish the rigid conformal structure of spacetime, while the ``bona fide clock'' required by MPSV serves the necessary mathematical role of breaking the dilation symmetry. We provide a formal derivation proving that the normalization of a single clock worldline is sufficient to select a unique metric from the conformal class, thereby clarifying that the number of fundamental constants is exactly one.

### [17] [Denoising gravitational wave with deep learning in the time-frequency domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20731)
*Yi-De Lee,Hwei-Jang Yo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning model combining the Griffin-Lim algorithm for gravitational wave denoising, focusing on BBH mergers with masses over 30 solar masses. It improves phase recovery and shows accuracy in both simulated and real data, especially during merger stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like match-filtering are less efficient for gravitational wave denoising. While existing deep learning approaches mostly use time-series data, time-frequency methods offer advantages. The need for better phase recovery in high-mass BBH events drives this research.

Method: The model uses the Griffin-Lim algorithm to reconstruct phase information from a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. This approach enhances phase recovery and integrates time-frequency processing for gravitational wave extraction.

Result: The method successfully aligns denoised amplitude and phase with mock waveforms. Applied to real BBH events, it shows consistency with template waveforms, particularly accurate around merger phases.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates improved gravitational wave denoising via deep learning and Griffin-Lim, suggesting promising methodology for future data analysis in astrophysics.

Abstract: Gravitational wave denoising is an ongoing task for revealing the events of compact binary objects in the universe. Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage. Our work suggests the possibility of a better methodological design for gravitational wave data analysis.

*S. Wang,A. Sajeendran,D. Yeom,R. B. Mann,J. Foo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hamiltonian formalism using coherent states to describe gravitational dynamics in quantum gravity theories, explaining mechanisms for geometry tunneling and addressing black hole evaporation with potential preservation of unitarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a dynamical framework for understanding gravitational evolution in quantum gravity theories, particularly addressing issues like black hole evaporation and unitarity preservation through a coherent state basis.

Method: Develops a Hamiltonian formalism based on coherent states, which are non-orthogonal, leading to superpositions of geometries and enabling tunneling phenomena. Applied to black hole evaporation scenarios.

Result: Shows that initial quasiclassical geometries evolve into superpositions, offering a mechanism for tunneling between geometries and hints at unitary preservation during black hole evaporation with quantum corrections.

Conclusion: The proposed formalism unifies various quantum gravity approaches and provides insights into resolving black hole information paradoxes by preserving unitarity through dynamic quantum geometric evolution.

Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.

### [19] [Wormholes as perturbations of near-horizon black hole geometries: no-go theorems within effective field theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21017)
*Takamasa Kanai,Kengo Maeda,Daisuke Yoshida*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that traversable wormholes cannot be constructed perturbatively from certain black holes within effective field theories due to symmetry constraints, requiring alternative methods or less symmetric black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of building wormhole solutions by perturbing near-horizon geometries of specific black holes and understanding the limitations imposed by effective field theories.

Method: Reformulates wormhole construction as perturbations around near-horizon geometries of near-extremal RN and Myers-Perry black holes. Compares approaches using Casimir energy source versus effective field theory corrections, analyzing energy-momentum tensor constraints.

Result: Shows that effective field theory approaches cannot generate traversable wormholes via perturbations due to symmetry constraints on the energy-momentum tensor, while Casimir energy-based methods (like Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov) work.

Conclusion: Establishes no-go theorems for perturbative wormhole construction in EFT, indicating that new ingredients or symmetry-reduced black holes are needed for such structures.

Abstract: We reformulate the construction of wormhole solutions as perturbations around near-horizon geometries of near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes in four dimensions and equal-angular-momenta Myers-Perry black holes in five dimensions. When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordström or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry.

### [20] [Observational appearance and photon rings of non-singular black holes from anisotropic fluids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21183)
*David Díaz-Guerra,Angel Rincon,Diego Rubiera-Garcia*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the optical appearance of non-singular black holes in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity using geometrically thin accretion disks. Despite modifications to photon ring features, distinguishing these black holes from Schwarzschild counterparts remains challenging due to entangled uncertainties in current methods. Dynamic observational techniques like hot-spots or gravitational wave ringdowns are suggested for future studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to discern observational differences between non-singular black holes in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity and Schwarzschild black holes, exploring how their unique photon sphere and horizon properties manifest in accretion disk images.

Method: The authors used geometrically thin, optically thin accretion disks with monochromatic emission based on adapted Standard Unbound profiles to simulate images. Photon ring width analysis was used to reconstruct Lyapunov exponents, correlating with observational features like ring intensities and hot-spot timescales.

Result: The study found that distinguishing non-singular black holes from Schwarzschild ones via photon ring analysis is problematic due to overlapping uncertainties. Key findings include the need for dynamic observational methods (hot-spots, gravitational waves) to overcome these limitations.

Conclusion: Current observational techniques struggle to differentiate these black hole types; future research must incorporate dynamical data like hot-spot motion or gravitational wave ringdowns to effectively distinguish non-singular black holes from Schwarzschild solutions.

Abstract: We consider the optical appearance of a non-singular, spherically symmetric black hole from Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity coupled to anisotropic fluids. Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates black hole shadows, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and greybody factors (GBFs) in a composite environment of modified Chaplygin-like dark fluid (MCDF) and cloud of strings (CoS), showing that CoS intensity primarily influences these observables while MCDF parameters introduce complex modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how exotic black hole environments, specifically those involving MCDF and CoS, affect key observables like shadows, QNMs, and GBFs, providing a framework to probe these environments through astronomical observations.

Method: The study uses the WKB approximation to compute quasinormal frequencies and greybody spectra, analyzes critical photon orbits and shadow structures under spherical accretion, and conducts a parameter study varying MCDF and CoS parameters.

Result: CoS intensity is the dominant factor in modifying shadows, QNMs, and GBFs, while MCDF parameters introduce more complex but measurable changes. These environmental components leave distinct, interrelated signatures on observables.

Conclusion: The findings offer specific observational predictions for detecting exotic black hole environments, highlighting the combined effects of MCDF and CoS on gravitational and electromagnetic signals, which can be tested with future astronomical observations.

Abstract: We present a unified investigation of black hole shadows, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and greybody factors (GBFs) for a static, spherically symmetric black hole within a composite environment of a modified Chaplygin-like dark fluid (MCDF) and a cloud of strings (CoS). We examine the structure of critical photon orbits and the corresponding optical appearance under spherical accretion. Using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, we compute the quasinormal frequencies and greybody spectra, and explore their correspondence with the black hole shadows in the eikonal limit. A systematic parameter study demonstrates that the CoS intensity has the primary influence on the shadows, QNMs and GBFs, while the MCDF parameters introduce more complex but characterizable modifications to each. Our results demonstrate that these environmental components imprint distinct yet interrelated signatures on key observables, offering specific predictions for probing exotic black hole environments.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The scattering of charged massive scalar waves by Kerr-Newman black holes, with incidence along the equatorial plane, is investigated in this work. The differential scattering cross section is computed using the partial wave method, with the forward divergence handled via the series reduction technique. For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\sim 135^{\circ} < φ< 270^{\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive. These findings highlight unique equatorial-plane signatures of charged, rotating spacetimes, distinguishing them from prior on-axis analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect the quantum nature of gravity by overcoming limitations of previous QGEM protocols using massive particles, exploiting photon properties for clearer tests of gravitational entanglement.

Method: Adapting QGEM to use photons as quantum systems, calculating gravitational interactions between massless relativistic particles, and analyzing entanglement features via LOCC criteria.

Result: Calculated that photon-based gravitational entanglement is extremely small but exhibits unique astronomical characteristics, providing potential experimental insights.

Conclusion: Photon systems offer a viable pathway for testing quantum gravity effects through entanglement analysis, inspiring future photon-based experiments in astrophysical contexts.

Abstract: In order to detect the quantum nature of gravity, the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses(QGEM) has been proposed both in flat and curved spacetime. In this paper we propose an analogous QGEM protocol using photons produced in astronomical processes as the quantum systems. Unlike massive particles, the gravitational interaction between photons-intrinsically relativistic particles-simultaneously satisfies both the event and system localities. So it can provide a clear test of whether the gravitational mediator must be nonclassical based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) principle. Although the gravitationally induced entanglement between massless relativistic photons is extremely small, our quantitative calculations clarify the characteristic features of the entanglement induced by the photon's own gravitational field in astronomical process and may inspire other photon entanglement experiments.

Motivation: To address discrepancies between recent numerical results (AVV) and prior analytical/numerical work (HP), clarifying inconsistencies and correcting errors in AVV's conclusions.

Method: Critical analysis of AVV's methodology and results, comparing them to HP's established framework on charged scalar field collapse dynamics.

Result: Identifies specific inaccuracies in AVV's claims, particularly regarding the tail decay rates and discrepancies in their numerical approach versus HP's theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Argues that AVV's conclusions are flawed due to methodological errors, reaffirming HP's original findings on the unique slower-decaying tails of charged scalar fields.

Abstract: The asymptotically decaying tails that characterize the late-time dynamics of collapsing self-gravitating charged massless scalar fields were studied three decades ago by Hod and Piran (HP). In particular, it was shown, both analytically and numerically, that the late-time behavior of these collapsing charged massless scalar fields is governed by oscillatory inverse power law tails, which decay more slowly than the familiar tails of neutral massless fields. Recently Álvares and Vaño-Viñuales (AVV) have investigated the same model numerically. While most of their results are in very good agreement with the earlier findings of HP, there are also some discrepancies between the original results of HP and those reported by AVV. In this compact comment, we wish to highlight a number of inaccurate claims and critical errors in the analysis and results presented by AVV.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study applies the SV-regularization scheme to AdS black holes, examining their thermodynamic properties, phase transitions, and merger scenarios. It finds parameter-dependent phase transitions and evolving mass bounds post-merger, with results reverting to standard black holes when the SV parameter is zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how SV-regularization affects the thermodynamics and phase behavior of AdS black holes, and to explore constraints on merger outcomes compared to traditional black holes.

Method: The SV-regularization scheme was applied to AdS black holes. The first and second laws of thermodynamics were validated through entropy formulas and merger simulations. Phase structure and free energy analyses were conducted, varying the SV parameter. Merger scenarios of two equal-mass SV-regular black holes were analyzed to study post-merger mass constraints.

Result: Non-trivial phase transitions dependent on the SV parameter were observed. Post-merger mass bounds initially increased then sharply decreased with higher SV parameters. Results align with standard black holes when the SV parameter is zero.

Conclusion: SV regularization significantly impacts black hole thermodynamics and merger dynamics. The findings highlight the parameter's role in modifying gravitational behavior, offering new insights into regularized spacetime models in AdS settings.

Abstract: In this article, we performed Simpson-Visser (SV)-regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes and then studied thermal properties of the resulting spacetime geometry. We considered the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics in this case and derived an entropy formula consistent with this new regular geometry. Next, we carried out the free energy analysis and studied the phase structure of these black holes. We discovered non-trivial phase transition properties dependent on the SV-regularization parameter. We also considered the validity of the second law of black hole thermodynamics and analyzed a merger scenario of two equal mass SV-regular black holes. In particular, we investigated the impact of the SV-regularization parameter on the constraints on post-merger black hole mass. Intrestingly, we found that the bounds initially increase and then fall sharply with increasing the SV-regularization parameter. All results are compared with standard black holes for vanishing SV-regularization parameter.

Motivation: To explore energy extraction mechanisms from black holes without requiring extremality or fine-tuning, focusing on charged particles in collisional processes.

Method: A simple model of pair creation is applied to study the collision of neutral particles producing oppositely charged particles near charged, rotating black holes.

Result: Significant energy extraction is achievable when escaping particles have sufficient charge, without needing extremal black holes or precise parameter tuning.

Conclusion: Charged particles play a critical role in efficient energy extraction processes around black holes, expanding possibilities beyond previous assumptions.

Abstract: We consider collisional Penrose process for charged, rotating black holes together with a simple model of pair creation, in which two oppositely charged particles are produced in a collision of two neutral particles. We highlight that significant energy extraction is possible without assuming fine-tuning or extremality as long as the escaping particles are sufficiently charged.

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified method to calculate tidal accelerations in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime, applicable to black holes and wormholes, and extends the concept of Hill's mass to naked singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for determining tidal tensors are case-specific and cumbersome, hindering the analysis of relativistic tidal forces in strong-field gravity. Astronomical observations could better probe gravitational properties with a general procedure.

Method: The approach uses relativistic frame transformations centered on the zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO) frame, enabling tidal tensor derivation for any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. Demonstrated in Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, Kerr-Newman, and a wormhole metric.

Result: Successfully derived tidal tensors for listed spacetimes and applied the method to extend Hill's mass concept to naked singularity metrics, showing its astronomical application potential.

Conclusion: The unified framework simplifies tidal force analysis in strong gravity regimes, facilitating use of observational data to test theories of gravity and explore compact objects like black holes and wormholes.

Abstract: The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.

Motivation: To understand how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through renormalization of gravitational constants, specifically analyzing the impact of scalar field properties on the correction terms.

Method: The authors use the Euclidean action, replica trick, and heat-kernel techniques to compute the first-order correction. They derive a closed-form expression dependent on horizon area, scalar mass, interaction strength, and curvature coupling.

Result: They obtained a logarithmically divergent correction to the entropy which is renormalized into Newton's constant. The final entropy follows Bekenstein-Hawking form with parameter-sensitive finite corrections influenced by field mass, interaction strength, and curvature.

Conclusion: Demonstrates analytically that quantum interactions cause entropy modifications via gravitational coupling renormalization. The corrections are maximized by light fields, strong interactions, and minimized by curvature effects, with conformally coupled fields showing no leading-order contribution.

Abstract: We compute the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction across the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.

### [29] [Hidden symmetries and separability structures of Ovcharenko-Podolský and conformal-to-Carter spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21538)
*Finnian Gray,David Kubiznak,Hryhorii Ovcharenko,Jiri Podolsky*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of type D spacetimes with non-aligned electromagnetic fields beyond the Plebański-Demiański family, demonstrating the existence of a hidden symmetry via a conformal Killing-Yano 2-form. This symmetry allows separation of variables in key equations and offers a framework for astrophysical applications and studying Penrose charges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extends the study of black hole spacetimes beyond the aligned electromagnetic fields of Plebański-Demiański metrics to explore non-aligned fields, addressing the need for new solutions with hidden symmetries useful for astrophysical applications and theoretical tests of Penrose charges.

Method: Analysis of the novel spacetime's geometric properties, specifically identifying the conformal Killing-Yano tensor, and applying it to separate variables in Hamilton-Jacobi, wave, Dirac equations, and perturbation equations.

Result: Confirmation of hidden symmetry allowing variable separation in key equations despite not generating a full symmetry tower, and establishment of these spacetimes as a test-bed for Penrose charges.

Conclusion: The work provides essential tools for applying these metrics in astrophysics and investigating hidden symmetries' role in gravitational theories, highlighting their utility over aligned field models in certain theoretical contexts.

Abstract: Recently, a remarkable new class of spacetimes describing black holes immersed in a non-aligned electromagnetic field has been found. While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Plebański--Demiański family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Plebański--Demiański class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full "tower of symmetries". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics. Moreover, as we shall show, the novel spacetimes provide an interesting test-ground for studying the recently defined Penrose charges whose existence is intrinsically related to hidden rather than explicit symmetries.

Abstract: We study the cosmological consequences of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) by deriving modified Friedmann equations through thermodynamic arguments. The evolution of the effective equation of state induced by EUP corrections is analyzed and characterized using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization. We then examine the fulfillment of classical energy conditions, including the null, weak, strong, and dominant conditions. The dynamical and thermodynamic stability of the model is investigated, showing that the EUP cosmology admits a late-time de Sitter attractor. Finally, we evaluate the effective speed of sound associated with the model and discuss implications for perturbative stability. Our findings indicate that EUP-induced corrections can produce a consistent late-time acceleration without requiring a cosmological constant.

Abstract: The detection of the gravitational waves produced after the coalescence of two neutron stars is greatly anticipated because it will be able to provide information about matter in extreme conditions, especially if the remnant turns out to go through a hypermassive or a supermassive neutron star state before collapsing into a black hole. Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation. One possibility would be to improve the sensitivity in a frequency range that allows us to determine whether or not a black hole was formed in the coalescence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: I present StarEstate, an open-source Python package for producing rapid, statistically robust galactic population synthesis models. By utilizing optimized pre-calculated inverse-cumulative distribution function samplers, the tool generates synthetic populations from pre-generated grids of stellar tracks orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical integration methods. A key morphological feature is the probabilistic assignment of stars to spiral arms based on age-dependent dynamical temperature, reproducing the observation that young tracers tightly confine to arms while older populations disperse. The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments. StarEstate's features allow the user to predict spatial distributions of diverse stellar objects, providing a flexible resource for interpreting galactic surveys.

Abstract: We introduce a novel direct calibration algorithm to address phase delay, gain, and offset mismatches in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) time interleaving systems. These mismatches, common in high-speed data acquisition, degrade system performance and signal integrity, particularly in applications such as radio astronomy and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Our proposed algorithm uses a sinusoidal reference signal and Fourier analysis to isolate and correct each type of mismatch, providing a computationally efficient solution. Extensive numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness and demonstrate its ability to significantly enhance signal reconstruction accuracy compared to existing methods. This work provides a robust and scalable solution for maintaining signal fidelity in interleaved ADC systems and has broad applications in fields that require high-speed data acquisition.

Abstract: TriPoDPy is a code simulating the dust evolution, including dust growth and dynamics in protoplanetary disks using the parametric dust model presented in (Pfeil et al., 2024). The simulation evolves a dust distribution in a one-dimensional grid in the radial direction. It's written in Python and the core routines are implemented in Fortran90. The code not only solves for the evolution of the dust but also the gas disk with the canonical alpha-description (Shakura & Sunyaev, 1973). In addition to the original model, we added descriptions of tracers for the dust and gas, which could be used for compositional tracking of additional components.

Abstract: Current-day multi-object spectroscopic surveys are often limited in their ability to observe bright stars due to their low surface densities, resulting in increased observational overheads and reduced efficiency. Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.

*Sergey Mirzoyan*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper presents a U-Net VAE framework to denoise JWST galaxy images, enhancing morphological classification of high-redshift galaxies (up to z~8). Denoising improves classification accuracy, revealing that ~70-80% of disk-like galaxies identified by GCNN are at redshifts >3, indicating early universe disk structure prevalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional classification methods struggle with faintness and structural complexities of high-redshift galaxies (z~8) observed by JWST. Denoising is needed to clarify morphological features for accurate classification.

Method: Applied a U-Net VAE framework to denoise JWST galaxy images. Evaluated performance using image quality metrics and assessed impact on classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models.

Result: Analysis of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 showed 83 disk-like classifications by GCNN, with 70-80% at z>3. Denoised images significantly improved classification accuracy compared to raw data.

Conclusion: VAE-based denoising is a robust preprocessing method for studying high-redshift galaxies. Results suggest disk-like structures were common in early universe, supporting theories of early galaxy evolution. This technique aids ongoing astronomical surveys analyzing distant galaxies.

Abstract: Building on our previous work, we apply a U-Net Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework to denoise galaxy images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and enhance morphological classification. This study focuses on galaxies observed up to redshift approximately at 8, capturing them at early evolutionary stages where their faintness and structural complexity pose challenges for the traditional classification methods. By mitigating observational noise, our approach enables the identification of morphological features, particularly in distinguishing between disk and non-disk galaxy types. We evaluate the denoising performance using standard image quality metrics and demonstrate that the enhanced images lead to improved classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models. Our analysis of a sample of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 shows 83 galaxies classified as disk-like by the GCNN model with high confidence, of those approximately 70-80 % are of redshifts greater than 3. These findings suggest that disk-like structures can be prevalent in the early universe. The results highlight the potential of VAE-based denoising as a robust pre-processing step for analyzing high-redshift galaxy populations in ongoing astronomical surveys.

### [37] [Mechanical Properties of the Proton from a Deformed AdS Holographic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20715)

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the proton using a holographic AdS/CFT model with a deformed anti-de Sitter background. It calculates contributions from gluons to form factors A and C, validates results against lattice QCD and prior holography approaches, and derives pressure/shear distributions supporting a stable proton structure under von Laue's condition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore proton's mechanical properties and validate holographic models against lattice QCD data, while investigating stability conditions via gravitational form factors and internal energy distributions.

Method: Holographic model with AdS/CFT framework, Dirac fields in deformed AdS geometry. Numerically compute form factors A and C from energy-momentum tensor. Calculate term D for pressure/shear distributions. Apply von Laue stability condition analysis.

Result: Numerical agreement with lattice QCD and prior holography results for form factors. Derived stable proton interpretation via pressure/shear distributions. Calculated radii for energy and mechanical distributions, confirmed internal force stability.

Conclusion: Holographic approach validates proton's mechanical stability and aligns with QCD data, offering insights into gluon contributions and internal structure through gravitational form factors and distribution radii.

Abstract: We study the gravitational form factors of the proton and some of its mechanical properties. We use a holographic model based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, in which a deformation in the anti-de Sitter background geometry is considered. By describing the proton as a Dirac field in this background, we numerically evaluate the gloun contribution of its gravitational form factors $A$ and $C$ from its energy-momentum tensor. A comparison of our numerical results with respect to some lattice QCD results and previous results in holography is made. In general, a good agreement is found. We also evaluate the term $D$ and make use of it to compute the pressure and shear distributions in the system, which result in a stable composed particle interpretation consistent with the von Laue stability condition. The energy distribution in the system is also obtained. Internal forces are investigated to support this picture. We are also able to compute the radii associated with these distributions in the proton.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model-independent method to detect new physics in high-dimensional hadron collider data by analyzing the dimensionality of event manifolds, avoiding the look-elsewhere effect and energy scale uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vast phase space of collider events makes it infeasible for humans or AI to exhaustively search for all possible new physics signals. Current methods struggle with exponential complexity and systematic uncertainties.

Method: The technique measures the intrinsic dimensionality of collider event manifolds. By using single particles instead of jets and analyzing dimensionality changes, it identifies anomalies indicating new physics without predefined models.

Result: Successfully detected new physics in simulated events with hundreds of dimensions, demonstrating immunity to look-elsewhere effects and energy scale uncertainties.

Conclusion: This work opens avenues for global, model-independent analyses of collider data, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional phase spaces for discovering beyond-Standard-Model phenomena.

Abstract: The phase space of hadron collider events spans hundreds of dimensions, generating an intricate geometry that we are just starting to explore. The number of possible new physics signals is exponential in the number of dimensions and detecting all of them is currently impossible for any human or artificial intelligence. In this work we introduce a method to search for new physics model-independently in this high-dimensional space. It is based on the measurement of the most basic property of the manifold of collider events, its dimensionality. Our proposed technique does not suffer from a look-elsewhere effect that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the dataset, and by construction is insensitive to energy scale uncertainties. We illustrate its potential by finding new physics in simulated events with hundreds of phase space dimensions, taking as input single particles rather than jets. This study sets the stage for new model-independent search strategies based on global properties of collider data manifolds.

### [39] [Discovery prospects for photophobic axion-like particles in the $WWjj$ final state at the High-Luminosity LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21003)
*Jiaojiao Feng,Ying-nan Mao,Kechen Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the potential for discovering photophobic axion-like particles (ALPs) via the WWjj final state at the HL-LHC. It focuses on ALP production via s-channel electroweak exchange and VBF-like processes, decaying to WW pairs. The analysis combines preselection and MVA techniques to estimate sensitivity for ALP couplings across 170-4000 GeV masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore discovery prospects of photophobic ALPs at the HL-LHC, addressing a gap in coverage for ALPs that do not couple strongly to photons. This fills a complementary role to other search strategies like photons or missing energy, focusing on WWjj final states where ALPs interact via electroweak bosons.

Method: The study uses a two-step strategy: preselection defining WWjj topology with two leptons, two jets, and moderate MET, followed by an MVA optimized per ALP mass. Signal separation accounts for both s-channel and VBF production mechanisms. Sensitivities are quantified using 2σ/5σ discovery thresholds for g_{aWW} coupling, and model-independent benchmarks on cross-section times branching ratio are provided.

Result: Discovery sensitivities show flat ~0.61 (0.76 TeV⁻¹) at 2σ (5σ) for 260-1500 GeV ALP masses. The WWjj channel offers competitive sensitivity compared to other channels, especially for intermediate mass ALPs (260-1500 GeV) where coupling limits are strongest.

Conclusion: The HL-LHC's WWjj topology provides a viable and complementary path to probe heavy photophobic ALPs, particularly effective in the 260-1500 GeV mass range. Results also facilitate reinterpretation for alternative models due to the fiducial cross-section benchmarks presented.

Abstract: We evaluate discovery prospects for photophobic axion-like particles (ALPs) in the $WWjj$ final state at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC; $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, $L=3$ ab$^{-1}$). In the photophobic limit ($g_{aγγ}=0$), ALPs couple to electroweak gauge bosons and are produced in association with two jets ($pp\to jj a$) via both $s$-channel electroweak exchange and vector-boson-fusion (VBF)-like topologies, followed by $a\to W^+W^-$ decay. We target the different-flavour dilepton mode $W^+W^-\to e^\pmμ^\mpν\barν$ with two jets and moderate missing transverse momentum. The analysis employs a two-step strategy: an initial preselection that defines the signal-like final state, followed by a multivariate analysis (MVA) trained on dijet and dileptonic-$WW$ kinematics from both the $s$-channel and VBF-like production mechanisms to separate signal from background; the MVA threshold is optimized independently at each $m_a$. We present $2σ$ and $5σ$ discovery sensitivities for the ALP-$W$ coupling $g_{aWW}$ across the $170$--$4000$ GeV mass range. For $260$ GeV $\le m_a \le 1500$ GeV, the $2σ$ ($5σ$) sensitivity is approximately flat around 0.61 (0.76) TeV$^{-1}$. We also report model-independent discovery thresholds for the fiducial quantity $σ(pp\to jj a)\,\mathrm{Br}(a\to W^+W^-)$ over the same mass range to enable reinterpretation for other models. These results indicate that the $WWjj$ topology offers competitive and complementary sensitivity to heavy photophobic ALPs at the HL-LHC.

*Runqi Kang,Xing Rong*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method using near-threshold enhancement to significantly improve the detection of exotic fermion interactions mediated by ultralight bosons, potentially enhancing experimental sensitivity by 10 orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exotic interactions beyond the Standard Model are difficult to detect due to short force ranges, limiting laboratory experiments. This work aims to overcome these limitations to access new physics.

Method: The method leverages near-threshold enhancement where the oscillation frequency of interactions approaches the mass of the new bosons, extending the effective force range indefinitely. A experimental setup is proposed to search for interactions in the 80-800 µeV mass range.

Result: For coupling constant gA^e gA^e, the method promises 10^10 improvement in upper bound limits at 800 µeV. The approach can be extended to other exotic interactions.

Conclusion: The near-threshold enhancement technique breaks experimental size limitations, enabling unprecedented sensitivity for detecting ultralight bosons and advancing beyond-Standard-Model physics searches.

Abstract: Exotic interactions between fermions mediated by new bosons beyond the Standard Model may hold the key to several fundamental conundrums on the frontier of physics.However, laboratory searching for exotic interactions on small length scales is fundamentally held back by the short force range.Here we propose that the force range of exotic interactions tends to infinity when the oscillation frequency of exotic interactions approaches the mass of the new bosons, i.e., the new bosons become nearly on-shell. This is named as the near-threshold enhancement. Through the near-threshold enhancement, even fermions at distances larger than the original force range can make considerable contributions to exotic interactions. Therefore, the size of the experimental apparatus can break the limitation of the force range, and thus both the signal of exotic interactions and the sensitivity of sensors can be greatly enhanced. We also propose a method to search for the exotic interactions in the mass range between 80 $μ$eV and 800 $μ$eV taking advantage of the near-threshold enhancement. For the coupling $g_{\rm A}^{\rm e}g_{\rm A}^{\rm e}$, we expect an improvement on its upper bounds of 10 orders of magnitude at 800 $μ$eV. This method can be further extended to enhance the search for other types of exotic interactions and boost the study of new physics beyond the Standard Model.

It has a neutral magnetic charge and is lighter than the Cho-Maison monopole, potentially around 3.28 TeV. The study discusses its construction, topological origin, and implications for physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the existence of new monopole types in the Standard Model beyond the electroweak monopole, focusing on electromagnetically neutral monopoles and their potential lower mass to explore new physics beyond current understanding.

Method: Constructing the neutral monopole solution mathematically, analyzing its topological structure originating from gauge field configurations, and comparing its properties with existing monopole models.

Result: Successful construction of the Z monopole with neutral magnetic charge and estimated mass (~3.28 TeV), suggesting it could be detected with future high-energy experiments and offering insights into electroweak symmetry breaking and beyond Standard Model physics.

Conclusion: The discovery of Z monopole opens new avenues in particle physics, providing a testable hypothesis for experimental validation and contributing to our understanding of magnetic monopoles and fundamental interactions.

Abstract: The standard model has the electroweak monopole which has the magnetic charge $4π/e$, as a hybrid between the Dirac and 'tHooft-Polyakov monopoles. We argue that it may have new type of monopoles, in particular the neutral monopole (``the Z monopole") which is electromagnetically neutral but has the neutral magnetic charge $4π/\be$, where $\be$ is the neutral charge. The mass of the new monopole could be less than the Cho-Maison monopole, around 3.28 TeV. We show how to construct the neutral monopole and clarify the origin of the topology of the new monopole. We discuss the implications of the new monopoles in physics.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study evaluates the potential of a future 3 TeV muon collider to detect muonphilic dark matter (DM) as an explanation for the Galactic Center GeV Excess (GCE), exploring three search strategies and showing that the collider could significantly constrain or confirm this DM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The GCE is an unresolved signal that muonphilic DM could explain, as it interacts via a new mediator coupling only to muons, avoiding detection limits from other experiments. A future muon collider offers a unique testing ground for these models.

Method: Using cut-and-count methods, the authors analyze signal and background for three strategies: visible (μ+μ−γ), invisible (mono-photon + missing energy), and off-shell mono-photon mediator production. They project exclusion limits at 95% CL for seven models across mediator mass ranges relevant to GCE.

Result: The study shows that the 3 TeV muon collider could cover substantial viable parameter space explaining the GCE, setting strong constraints and offering decisive tests of muonphilic DM hypotheses.

Conclusion: A future muon collider is identified as critical for confirming or excluding muonphilic DM as the GCE source, highlighting its role in particle physics beyond traditional colliders.

Abstract: The Galactic Center GeV Excess (GCE) remains a compelling but enigmatic signal from the inner region of our galaxy. Muonphilic dark matter (DM), which couples exclusively to muons via a new mediator, provides a viable explanation for the GCE and relic density while naturally evading constraints from direct detection, collider searches and other multi-messenger observations. Based on the viable non-resonant parameter space identified in previous global fits, we perform a comprehensive study exploring the prospects for discovering such muonphilic DM in the context of a future $3$ TeV muon collider, focusing on simplified models with a $Z_2$-even mediator. Three distinct search strategies are investigated: visible on-shell mediator decays ($μ^{+}μ^{-}γ$ final state), invisible on-shell mediator decays (mono-photon plus missing energy), and mono-photon production via off-shell mediators. Through a detailed signal-background analysis using cut-and-count methods, we project the exclusion limits at $95\%$ confidence level for seven representative models across a wide range of mediator masses. Our results demonstrate that the projected limits cover a significant portion of the viable parameter space that explains the GCE, establishing a muon collider as a decisive machine for testing the muonphilic DM hypothesis.

Motivation: To determine the feasibility and accuracy of detecting lepton flavour violation through dimension-six operators at future colliders, improving upon current experimental limits.

Method: Cuts-based analysis applied to 1.3 TeV centre-of-mass energy data with up to ~1 ab⁻¹ luminosity. Optimal observables method analyzed kinematic distributions. Impact of initial electron beam polarization was also evaluated.

Result: Sensitivity to effective couplings was quantified, showing improved measurement precision with higher luminosity and polarized electron beams.

Conclusion: The proposed electron-proton collider can significantly enhance the detection sensitivity of lepton flavour-violating interactions, especially with polarized beams, advancing tests of flavour physics beyond current standards.

Abstract: We estimate the accuracy with which the coefficient of the lepton flavour-violating dimension-six operators can be measured at the proposed electron-proton collider. Cuts-based analysis is performed to compute the signal significance at the centre of mass energy of 1.3 TeV, with a total integrated luminosity upto $\sim$ab$^{-1}$. Using the optimal observables method for the kinematic distributions, we study the sensitivity of the effective couplings. We also study the impact of the initial electron beam polarisation.

Based on our successful explanations of the existing experimental data for the $Λ_b \to Λ_c(π^-, K^{-}, D^{-}, D^{-}_s, D_s^{*-})$ processes, we further calculate the decay rates of the $Λ_b$ baryon into the $1P$-, $1D$-, $2S$-, $3S$-, $2P$-, $1F$-, and $2D$-wave $Λ_c$ excited states. It is found that these $Λ_c$ excitations have a large production rate in the $Λ_b$ hadronic weak decay process associated $π^-$ meson emitting, i.e., $Λ_b\to Λ_c^{*}π^-$, their branching fractions can reach up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. To search for the higher $3S$-, $2P$-, $1F$-, and $2D$-wave $Λ_c$ states, the $Λ_b \to Λ_c (3S) π^-\to D^{*0}p π^-$, and $Λ_b\to Λ_c(2P,2D,1F) π^-\to D^{(*)0}pπ^-$ decays are worth observing in future experiments.

Abstract: We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.

### [46] [Freeze-in at Low Reheating and Direct Detection of Fermion Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21520)
*Amir Amiri,Bastian Diaz Saez,Kilian Möhling*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores a low-reheating-temperature freeze-in scenario with minimal fermionic dark matter and a pseudoscalar mediator, analyzing production mechanisms, thermalization conditions, and direct-detection constraints from LZ and DARWIN experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study dark matter production in scenarios where the mediator doesn't thermalize with the Standard Model, focusing on low-reheating-temperature environments to understand constraints from current/future experiments.

Method: Derive thermalization/non-thermalization conditions for the pseudoscalar mediator, calculate dark matter relic density via mediator decay, and apply direct detection limits using data from LZ and DARWIN experiments.

Result: Establishes parameter spaces where non-thermal production dominates, identifies regions compliant with current LZ constraints and future DARWIN sensitivities, highlighting viable models for low-reheating-temperature scenarios.

Conclusion: Such minimal models can accommodate freeze-in mechanisms at low reheating temperatures, with direct detection prospects improving as experiments like DARWIN achieve higher sensitivity.

Abstract: We investigate a low-reheating-temperature freeze-in scenario within a minimal model of fermionic dark matter interacting through a pseudoscalar mediator. In this setup, dark matter is produced via the decay of the pseudoscalar, which remains in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model bath. We derive the thermalization and non-thermalization conditions for the new fields and obtain the corresponding direct-detection constraints and projections on the model based on LZ and DARWIN experiments, respectively.
