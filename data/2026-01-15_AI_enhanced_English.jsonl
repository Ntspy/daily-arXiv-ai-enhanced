Rigorous canonical quantization proves that general covariance cannot be maintained quantum mechanically in dimensions greater than two, while recent path integral calculations reveal persistent gauge parameter dependence in quantum gravitational corrections, signaling BRST symmetry violation.

Here, we perform a suite of 3D PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection including inverse Compton (IC) losses in the weakly cooled regime in which the radiation-reaction-limited Lorentz factor $\u03b3_{\\rm rad}$ exceeds the magnetization $\u03c3$. We show that electron cooling losses do not appreciably alter the reconnection rate, the structure of the layer, and the physics of particle acceleration in the free phase, so the spectrum of free electrons is $dN_{\\rm free}/d\u03b3\\propto \u03b3^{-1}$, as in the uncooled case.

The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels.

A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next.

For stripped-envelope supernovae, NSs with $B_{dip} \u2265 10^{13}$ G and $P_{NS} \u2264 a few ms$ cause blowout; weaker fields yield UV/optical double-peaked curves like in LSQ14bdq, while stronger fields create X-ray precursors and hypernovae. Ultra-stripped SNe and merger events produce rapid X-ray transients. This motivates multi-wavelength observations to study energetic NS formation.", "motivation": "To understand the dynamical and radiative impacts of energetic NS winds on supernova ejecta, determine observational signatures linked to NS properties, and constrain NS formation scenarios through multi-wavelength observations.", "method": "Developed a semi-analytic framework based on multidimensional simulations to model post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, scanned NS/ejecta parameter spaces, computed survey-ready light curves for different scenarios (standard SNe, ultra-stripped SNe, mergers).", "result": "1. Blowout occurs for NSs with $B_{dip} \u226510^{13}$ G and $P_{NS} \u2264 few ms$ in typical stripped SNe. 2. Weak-field NSs produce double-peaked UV/optical light curves matching LSQ14bdq. 3. Strong-field NSs create X-ray precursors and hypernovae. 4. Ultra-stripped SNe/mergers yield fast X-ray transients ($10^{2-4}$ s duration, $10^{42-48}$ erg/s luminosity).", "conclusion": "Energetic NSs significantly influence supernova dynamics and produce detectable multi-band signatures. Coordinated UV/optical/X-ray surveys can constrain NS parameters and validate theoretical models of NS formation in core-collapse events."}}

We present here a time-resolved spectroscopic analysis of the burst, along with the detection of burst oscillations within a 51-second interval during the decay phase. The oscillation frequency is measured to be $\u03bd= 413.674 \\pm 0.002\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, consistent with previous reports. However, we detect a significant downward frequency drift over the burst duration, characterized by $\\dot\u03bd = (-4.7 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz\\,s^{-1}}$. This frequency evolution is atypical compared to those observed in similar burst oscillation sources. We tentatively attribute the observed drift to a Doppler shift induced by orbital motion. Under this interpretation, the inferred orbital period must be shorter than 20 minutes, placing \\textit{4U~0614+091} among the most compact known low-mass X-ray binaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Detection of a thermonuclear X-ray burst from 4U 0614+091 with SVOM, showing unusual burst oscillations with a significant frequency drift, suggesting a very short orbital period.", "motivation": "To analyze the X-ray burst and burst oscillations from 4U 0614+091, investigate the frequency drift, and infer orbital parameters.", "method": "Time-resolved spectroscopy with SVOM's ECLAIRs instrument; detected burst oscillations during decay phase; measured frequency and drift using spectral timing analysis.", "result": "Measured frequency \u03bd=413.674\u00b10.002 Hz with drift \u1e45=(-4.7\u00b10.3)\u00d710\u207b\u00b3 Hz/s.
