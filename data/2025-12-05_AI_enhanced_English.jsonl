This dispersion is believed to be a combination of beaming effects, different geometries, and case-by-case variability of the emission mechanism efficiency, but it is not clear in what proportion. In this work we focused on the gamma-ray range and analysed the four main ingredients that likely contribute to this dispersion: the geometrical term arising from the anisotropic emission (beaming), viewing and inclination angles, the uncertainty on the pulsar distance, the uncertainty on the moment of inertia, and the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism producing the gamma-ray emission. Estimating the expected ranges of the moment of inertia and the distance errors, and considering a geometrical and spectral model that we have recently used to fit the light curves and spectra of the entire gamma-ray pulsar population, we estimate the a priori distribution of the first three ingredients in order to obtain the a posteriori distribution of the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism. We found the latter to peak at $\\sim 5-15 \\%$ and to have a dispersion of around one order of magnitude. That is, we found the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism to be the leading factor in the observed dispersion. In addition, we found little sensitivity of these results on different distributions of the estimated pulsar distance errors, and saw that the weak, alleged correlation with the spin-down power can only explain part of the observed dispersion.

Due to a solar array drive assembly malfunction starting in March 2018, only small number (15) of SGRE events were observed during SC 25. Over the first 61 months, the average sunspot number (SSN) increased from 56.9 in SC 24 to 79.0 in SC 25. Fast and wide (FW) CMEs and decameter-hectometric (DH) type II bursts also increased significantly in SC 25 by 29% and 33%, respectively when normalized to SSN. Therefore, the increase in solar activity should result in a higher number of SGREs in SC 25. We estimated the number of SGREs in SC 25 using three methods. (i) If the SGRE number varies commensurate FW CMEs and DH type II bursts, SC 25 should have 45-47 SGRE events. (ii) In SC 24, ~17% of FW CMEs and 25% of DH type II bursts were associated with SGRE events. At this rate, SC 25 should have 46 SGRE events. (iii) Since SGRE events are invariably associated with >100 keV hard X-ray (HXR) bursts, we identified DH type II bursts associated with >100 keV HXR bursts from Fermi gamma ray burst monitor (GBM) during LAT data gaps. Based on our finding that SGRE events in SCs 24 and 25 were all associated with HXR bursts of duration > ~5 min, we found only 27 of the 79 LAT-gap type II bursts had >100 keV HXR bursts with duration > ~5 min. These DH type II bursts are likely to indicate SGRE, bringing the total number of SGRE events to 42 (15 observed + 27 inferred). Thus, the three methods provide similar estimates of the number of SGRE events in SC 25. We, therefore, conclude that that SC 25 is stronger than SC 24 based on the estimated number SGRE events.

The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons.

We argue that these two classes can be further distinguished by analyzing the angular observables of the lepton pair in the transverse momentum and in the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair. We therefore present an analysis of the lepton-pair angular observables in both these distributions. Based on a precise estimate of the Standard Model contribution to the relevant observables for the $pp\\to l^{+}l^{-}+X$ process up to $O(\u03b1_{S}^{2})$, we present realistic projections for the sensitivity of the LHC with $300$ fb$^{-1}$ and for the HL-LHC with $3$ ab$^{-1}$ to chirality-breaking interactions, demonstrating that angular observables provide an independent and clean handle on SMEFT effects, especially in regions where the Standard Model contribution is naturally suppressed thanks to the Lam-Tung relation. This analysis becomes crucial to go beyond single parameter global fits, since it helps breaking degeneracies with chirality preserving operators and to disentangle overlapping directions in the EFT parameter space.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our main goal is to identify similarities and differences between models in this family in regard to weak-field solutions. To this end, we use the effective source formalism to compare the related effective delta sources, mass functions, and Newtonian potentials. We obtain a variety of representations for these quantities in terms of series, integrals, and special functions, as well as simple approximations that capture the relevant dependence on the parameters $N_s$ and $\u03bc_s$ - which can be used to explore the weak-field phenomenology of nonlocal gravity. We explain why only for $N_s>1$ the Newtonian potential oscillates and prove that, despite the oscillations, the effective masses are positive. Moreover, we verify that these linearized solutions are regular (without curvature singularities). Finally, we also calculate the form of the leading logarithmic quantum correction to the Newtonian potential in these models. In all our considerations, we assume that $N_s$ is a positive real parameter. The cases of non-integer $N_s$ might be applied beyond nonlocal gravity, in effective approaches to implement quantum corrections in the weak field regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines the Newtonian limit of nonlocal gravity models with exponential form factors, focusing on weak-field solutions, showing oscillations in the Newtonian potential for N_s > 1 and confirming regularity of solutions.", "motivation": "To compare different nonlocal gravity models within the same family by analyzing their weak-field behaviors using effective source formalism, with potential applications in quantum corrections.", "method": "Utilizes effective source formalism to derive delta sources, mass functions, and Newtonian potentials through series, integrals, and special functions, while validating parameters N_s and \u03bc_s.
