In this paper, we developed a population\nsynthesis algorithm for pulsars which belong to a binary, in order to check\nwhether most of the observed recycled pulsars were formed via an accretion\nmechanism and derive statistics about their properties, that are difficult to\nobtain through observations. We also make predictions for future surveys.\nToward the presented objectives, we use the code Stellar EVolution for N-body\n(SEVN) to take into account all the binary processes and our own code to evolve\neach pulsar self-consistently by taking into account the secular evolution of a\nforce-free magnetosphere, the magnetic field decay, gravitational braking and\nspatial evolution. Each pulsar is born in binary with a main sequence\ncompanion, and evolve to present time. The radio and $\\gamma$-ray emission\nlocations were modeled by the polar cap geometry and striped wind model,\nrespectively. Our simulations seem to reproduce well the population of radio\nand $\\gamma$-ray pulsars observed in the selected surveys. We also found that\nthere should be less than $330$ unidentified pulsars in the Fourth Fermi-LAT\ncatalogue of $\\gamma$-ray sources (4FGL). High values of the viewing angle\n$\\zeta$ seem to be needed to be able to observe the recycled pulsars, and it\nalso seems difficult to observe recycled pulsars with an aligned rotation axis\nand magnetic axis (i.e., $\\chi \\leq 10${\\deg}).
