### [1] [Embedding Reliability for Unsupervised Classification of Gamma Ray Burst progenitors from Prompt Gamma-ray Emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20833)
*Nicoló Cibrario,Michela Negro*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of a 2D embedding of Gamma-Ray Burst data using scDEED, finding over 90% of events are trustworthy after dimensionality reduction via autoencoder and UMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of the 2D representation of GRB distributions created from high-dimensional prompt emission data, ensuring valid scientific interpretations.

Method: 1. Used autoencoder to reduce 12-waterfall-plot data to 30D latent space.
2. Applied UMAP for further reduction to 2D.
3. Applied scDEED statistical method to evaluate embedding quality, classifying event reliability.

Result: Over 90% of GRB events in the 2D embedding were classified as trustworthy by scDEED analysis.

Conclusion: The 2D embedding is reliable for analyzing GRB distributions, supporting its use in astrophysical studies despite some unavoidable data distortions.

Abstract: We present a statistical method based on scDEED to assess the reliability of
a 2D embedding showing a low-dimensional representation of the distribution of
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM).
The original dataset consists of 12 waterfall plots for each event, which
contain key information about the prompt emission of each GRB. The dataset's
dimensionality is first reduced to a 30-dimensional latent space using an
autoencoder, and subsequently to 2D using UMAP. While the methodology and
results are discussed in a previous work (arXiv:2406.03643), here we introduce
a statistical approach to evaluate the reliability of the final 2D distribution
based on the scDEED algorithm. Our analysis shows that the 2D embedding
demonstrates overall good reliability, with more than 90\% of the events
classified as trustworthy.

### [2] [Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20898)
*Pau Amaro Seoane*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates whether tidal stripping of brown dwarfs orbiting Sagittarius A* can explain the observed daily flares. High-resolution simulations show that this mechanism reproduces flare durations and luminosities, suggesting brown dwarfs are a viable fuel source and linking electromagnetic flares to gravitational wave sources for LISA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exact mechanism behind the daily energetic flares from Sgr A* is unknown. Brown dwarfs, as potential precursors of XMRIs detectable by LISA, could provide the necessary fuel through tidal interactions, which this study explores to connect electromagnetic observations with gravitational wave astronomy.

Method: High-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions with brown dwarfs were conducted, coupled with a non-thermal radiation model. The dynamics of tidal debris fallback and viscous evolution were analyzed to match observed flare characteristics.

Result: Simulations replicate the 1-hour flare duration and peak luminosity. The mechanism requires extreme radiative inefficiency in non-thermal emission, constraining emission efficiency and supporting the existence of a hidden brown dwarf population in the Galactic Center.

Conclusion: Tidal stripping of brown dwarfs is a viable explanation for Sgr A* flares, linking them to XMRIs for LISA. This connection allows early detection of gravitational wave sources, aiding precision tests of general relativity via electromagnetic alerts.

Abstract: Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the
Milky Way, exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal
emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow
is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio
frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains
debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting
Sgr A*. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals
(XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We investigate whether the
tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the
observed flares. Here we present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of
grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation
model. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent
viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics
of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration.
We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically
consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the
non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These
findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in
the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight
orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link
between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources,
alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI
systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests
of general relativity.

### [3] [It's always the quiet ones: Single Degenerate Double Detonation Type Ia Supernova from Quiescent Helium Accretion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20904)
*Amir Michaelis,Yael Hillman,Hagai B. Perets*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study presents a sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation pathway for Type Ia supernovae via recurrent helium accretion on a CO white dwarf, resulting in detonations in the helium shell and core, producing ejecta and yields consistent with observed supernovae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the viability of sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation models as progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, addressing gaps in understanding how such systems evolve under 'quiet' conditions to trigger explosions.

Method: 3D hydrodynamic simulations using FLASH code, starting with a 0.7 solar mass CO white dwarf undergoing steady helium accretion until 1.1 solar mass. Time-evolved helium-rich profiles are simulated with nuclear burning models, triggered by a localized temperature perturbation causing a helium detonation followed by a core carbon-oxygen detonation.

Result: Produced Ni-56 yield of ~0.64 Msun, intermediate elements ~0.41 Msun, and ejecta velocities up to 22,000 km/s, matching normal Type Ia features. Demonstrated that 'quiet' accretors can robustly produce double detonations.

Conclusion: Recurrent helium accreting white dwarfs are viable progenitors for sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia SNe, expanding the range of possible explosion mechanisms beyond classical models.

Abstract: We investigate a sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation pathway for Type Ia
supernovae arising from single degenerate helium accreting carbon-oxygen white
dwarfs. Building on our previous one dimensional study of recurrent helium
novae (Hillman et al. 2025), we evolve a 0.7 solar mass white dwarf through
steady accretion at 10^-8 Msun yr^-1 until it reaches 1.1 solar mass, yielding
realistic, time evolved helium rich profiles. These profiles are mapped into
FLASH simulations, incorporating nuclear burning for helium and carbon-oxygen
detonation, in multi-dimensional hydrodynamic runs. A localized, modest
temperature perturbation near the base of the helium shell robustly triggers an
outward helium-shell detonation. The ensuing inward propagating shock converges
in the carbon-oxygen core, igniting a secondary detonation that unbinds the
star. We obtain a Ni56 yield of ~0.64 solar mass, an intermediate-mass element
(Si-Ca) mass of ~0.41 solar mass, and maximum ejecta velocities approaching
22,000 km/s, values consistent with normal Type Ia supernovae. Our results
demonstrate that recurrent helium accretors, typically quiescent over long
timescales, can evolve under subtle, "quiet" conditions to trigger robust
double detonations, supporting their role as viable progenitors of
sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernovae.

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the Telescope Array (TA) are the
world's two largest ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) observatories. They
operate in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively, at similar
latitudes but with distinct surface detector (SD) designs. A significant
challenge in studying UHECR physics across the full sky is the apparent
discrepancy in flux measurements between the two experiments. This discrepancy
could arise from astrophysical differences and/or systematic effects related to
their detector designs and sensitivities to extensive air shower components. To
address this, the Auger@TA working group aims to cross-calibrate the two
observatories with a self-triggering micro-Auger array within the TA array.
This micro-array consists of eight Auger Surface Detector (SD) stations
equipped with Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) and AugerPrime Surface
Scintillator Detectors. Seven SD stations, configured with a centered-1-PMT
design, are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with one station in the center,
with 1.5 km spacing, mirroring the Auger layout. The eighth station, which
features a standard 3-PMT Auger station, is located in conjunction with a TA
detector at the center of the hexagon, forming a triplet for high-statistics
and low-uncertainty cross-calibration. A custom communication system that uses
readily available components enables seamless communication between stations
and remote access to each station through a central computer. The micro-array
is now fully deployed, and initial data-taking is about to start. This
presentation will detail the instrumentation, communication systems, central
data acquisition system, expected performance of the micro-array, and
preliminary results as appropriate.

### [5] [Multiwavelength view of circumstellar interaction in supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20913)
*Poonam Chandra*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper reviews how circumstellar interaction in supernovae reveals progenitor star characteristics and mass-loss history, using SN 2010jl as an example. The Time Machine technique is proposed as a key method to link progenitor stars to supernova outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To link supernova progenitors to their explosive outcomes by analyzing circumstellar interaction signatures, addressing a major gap in understanding stellar evolution and explosion mechanisms.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis of supernova subclasses, combined with unpublished Chandra X-ray and radio observations of SN 2010jl. The study tracks interaction evolution up to 7 years post-explosion using the Time Machine technique.

Result: Confirmed that SN 2010jl had an extreme mass-loss rate (0.1 Msun/yr) from 300 years pre-explosion. Demonstrated multi-wavelength methods effectively trace progenitor mass-loss histories over different timescales.

Conclusion: Circumstellar interaction studies via the Time Machine technique can solve the mystery of mapping progenitors to supernova types. Continued observations and improved modeling will advance this field.

Abstract: The interaction of post-explosion supernova ejecta with the surrounding
circumstellar medium creates emission across the electromagnetic spectrum.
Since the circumstellar medium is created by the mass lost from the progenitor
star, it carries tell-tale signatures of the progenitor. Consequently,
observations and modeling of radiation produced by the interaction in various
types of supernovae have provided valuable insights into their progenitors.
Detailed studies have shown that the interaction in supernovae begins and
sustains over various timescales and lengthscales, with differing mass-loss
rates in distinct sub-classes. This reveals diverse progenitor histories for
these stellar explosions. This review paper summarizes various supernova
subtypes, linking them to stellar death pathways, and presents an updated
supernova classification diagram. We then present a multi-wavelength study of
circumstellar interaction in different supernova classes. We also present
unpublished Chandra X-ray as well as radio observations of a type IIn
supernova, SN 2010jl, which allow us to extend its circumstellar interaction
studies to about 7 years post-explosion. The new data indicates that the
extreme mass-loss rate 0.1 Msun/yr in SN 2010jl, reported by Chandra et al.
(2015), commenced within the last 300 years before the explosion. We summarize
the current status of the field and argue that via detailed studies of the
circumstellar interaction, a.k.a. Time Machine technique, one of the big
mysteries of stellar evolution, i.e., mapping supernovae progenitors to their
explosive outcomes can be solved.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) carried out a public survey
for optical transients between 2007 and 2019, discovering more than 16,000
transient candidates. Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of
the spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we
find that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we
prioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our
spectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These
objects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of
type-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We
highlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a
type-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN
2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I
supernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than
200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that
exhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our
previous finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of
extremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin
of transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal
disruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present
CSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220
that occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6.

### [7] [Detecting Population III Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Era of EP and SVOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21097)
*Jun-Jie Wei,Qing-Bo Ma,Xue-Feng Wu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study evaluates the detectability of Population III (Pop III) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using the EP/WXT and SVOM/ECLAIRs instruments. It finds that while Pop III GRB rates are low (upper limits of ~0.06-0.13 events/yr), their fractional contribution increases with redshift, reaching 28–68% at z>16, making detection feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe the properties of the first stars (Pop III) through high-redshift GRBs and assess the capability of next-generation telescopes like EP/WXT and SVOM/ECLAIRs in detecting these events.

Method: The authors use cosmological N-body/hydrodynamical simulations with three different Pop III IMFs. They synthesize GRB populations calibrated to Swift data and compute detection rates for the telescopes.

Result: Pop III GRB detection rates are low at z>6 (~0.06–0.13 events/yr), but their fraction rises with redshift, becoming significant (>28%) at z>16. Current Swift data sets upper limits due to no confirmed Pop III GRBs at z>5.5.

Conclusion: Detecting Pop III GRBs at z>16 is achievable with upcoming instruments, with such high-redshift GRBs likely of Pop III origin.

Abstract: High-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), putative counterparts of massive,
low-metallicity Population III (Pop III) stars, are a promising probe of the
first stars. We assess the detectability of these Pop III GRBs using a
metallicity-based progenitor criterion and cosmological $N$-body/hydrodynamical
simulations with three distinct Pop III initial mass functions (IMFs), focusing
on the capabilities of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein
Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the
Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Our
population synthesis model, calibrated to \emph{Swift} data, predicts the
following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z>6$:
$\sim2.4\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{EP}/WXT and
$\sim0.9\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. For the IMF with
very massive first stars ($\mathrm{100\textrm{--}500\,M_\odot}$), we derive
upper limits on the Pop III GRB rate at $z>6$ of
$<0.06\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{EP}/WXT) and
$<0.13\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs), based on the absence
of confirmed Pop III progenitors in \emph{Swift} bursts at $z>5.5$. Our results
indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z<10$,
their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching
$\sim8\%$ ($\sim34\%$) at $z>10$ and $\sim28\%$ ($\sim68\%$) at $z>16$ for
\emph{EP}/WXT (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in
the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of
$\mathrm{[0.1,\,100]\,M_\odot}$. We conclude that detecting Pop III GRBs at
high redshifts is a realistic prospect, and any GRB detected at $z>16$ is most
likely of Pop III origin.

### [8] [Observation of In-ice Askaryan Radiation from High-Energy Cosmic Rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21104)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents the first experimental evidence of in-ice Askaryan radiation from high-energy particle cascades in Antarctic ice using data from the Askaryan Radio Array. The observed events' characteristics match expectations for Askaryan emission from cosmic ray air showers, with confidence excluding background sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to confirm the existence of in-ice Askaryan radiation and distinguish it from other phenomena like geomagnetic charge separation, providing experimental validation of theoretical predictions.

Method: A reanalysis of 13 previously identified radiofrequency events from 208 days of data. Criteria included event rate, signal direction, shape, spectrum, polarization, and comparison against background models.

Result: Events strongly align with Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray showers impacting ice, rejection of geomagnetic origin, and a 5.1σ discrepancy from background expectations.

Conclusion: The study confirms in-ice Askaryan radiation, advancing cosmic ray detection methods and providing insights into particle cascade dynamics in Antarctic ice.

Abstract: We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice Askaryan radiation --
coherent charge-excess radio emission -- from high-energy particle cascades
developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the
phased-array instrument of the Askaryan Radio Array, a previous analysis has
incidentally identified 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency signals
originating from below the ice surface. We here present a detailed reanalysis
of these events. The observed event rate, radiation arrival directions, signal
shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with
in-ice Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice
sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern favors an
extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source. An origin from the
geomagnetic separation of charges in cosmic ray air showers is disfavored by
the arrival directions and polarization. Considering the arrival angles, timing
properties, and the impulsive nature of the passing events, the event rate is
inconsistent with the estimation of the combined background from thermal noise
events and on-surface events at the level of $5.1\,\sigma$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized,
collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and
magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical at intermittent structures in plasma
turbulence. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and
Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden.
The interaction of DKI and KHI generates qualitatively new structures, marked
by a thickened shear layer with very weak electromagnetic field, modulated by
KH vortices. Over a range of moderately strong velocity shears explored, the
interaction of DKI and KHI results in a significant enhancement of dissipation
over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we
observe a new and efficient way of particle acceleration where particles are
stochastically accelerated by the motional electric field exterior to the shear
layer as they meander in an S-shaped pattern in and out of it. This process
takes advantage of the bent geometry of the shear layer caused by the DK-KHI
interaction and is responsible for most of the highest-energy particles
produced in our simulations. These results further our understanding of
dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures, which are
present in plasma turbulence across a wide range of astrophysical contexts such
as in AGN jet sheaths, potentially relevant to limb-brightened emission, etc.,
and highlight the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple interacting
instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their
nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.

### [10] [Detection of Quasi-periodic Oscillations in the $γ$-Ray Light Curve of 4FGL J0309.9-6058](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21205)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper identifies a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a 550-day period in the γ-ray emissions from PKS 0308-611 using multi-method analysis, suggesting a precessing jet as the cause.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect and characterize potential QPOs in γ-ray data, which could provide insights into the emission mechanisms and jet dynamics of active galactic nuclei.

Method: Applied Lomb-Scargle, REDFIT, WWZ methods, and Gaussian Process to Fermi γ-ray light curves. Checked consistency across methods and extended analysis to full Fermi dataset.

Result: Confirmed QPO (550 days) with 3.72σ local significance, 2.72σ global significance. Time lag between optical/γ-ray bands suggests separate emission regions.

Conclusion: The QPO likely arises from a precessing jet given the period's scale and statistical significance across analyses.

Abstract: In this work, we report, for the first time, a quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO) in the $\gamma$-ray band of 4FGL J0309.9-6058, also known as PKS
0308-611. We employed three analytical methods (the Lomb-Scargle periodogram,
REDFIT, and the weighted wavelet Z-transform) to analyze the QPO signal using
\textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray light curve data. The analysis reveals a potential
QPO during MJD 57983$-$60503, with a period of approximately 550 days and a
maximum local significance of 3.72$\sigma$ and global significance of
2.72$\sigma$ derived from the WWZ analysis. To validate this result, we applied
Gaussian Process (GP) to the same light curve, which independently confirms the
presence of QPO signal consistent with our Fourier-based results. We further
extended the analysis to the full duration of the \textit{Fermi} observations,
and the results consistently support and strengthen the presence of this QPO
signal. Additionally, a time lag between the optical and $\gamma$-ray bands
indicates separate emission regions for these two bands. Given the year-like
timescale of the QPO signal and the fact that a QPO signal with local
significance over 3$\sigma$ for full \textit{Fermi}-LAT observed time, we
suggest that the QPO is most likely caused by a precessing jet.

Abstract: We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole
spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in
jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW)
model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability
timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black
hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our
analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field
($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability
timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical
variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black
hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with
the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the
characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm
DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant
correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass,
expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm
\odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this
relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black
hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational
instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the
light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.

Abstract: The electromagnetic detection of circumbinary disks around pre-merger binary
black holes (BBHs) relies on theoretical predictions. These are generally
obtained through expensive numerical simulations, but simple or fast toy models
are lacking to unleash the potential of these theoretical advances for
observational purposes. We aim to present a simple toy model to compute the
electromagnetic variability of circumbinary disks around circular-orbit BBHs at
relativistic separations, focusing on the impact of disk non-axisymmetries. We
assume that the disk is threaded by spiral arms and hosts a hotspot linked to
an overdense structure (the {\lq}lump{\rq}) preferably reported in binaries
close to equal mass. We build a simple temperature distribution, and estimate
its thermal emission, perceived by a distant observer, via a ray-tracing code
in a BBH approximate metric. We propose a toy model reproducing the main
lightcurve features and show it is consistent with 2D general-hydrodynamical
simulations under the assumption of compressional heating and expansional
cooling except for purely dynamical effects such as the binary-lump beat. The
lightcurve exhibits a main modulation at the lump's period (i.e. a few times
the orbital period), due to relativistic Doppler effect, and a shorter one at
the orbital-like period, due to spiral arms or the beat. These are more
prominent in the optical/UV band for a total binary mass $M\, {=} \,
10^{4-10}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, where the disk energy spectrum peaks. For
$M=10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, a $4\%$-amplitude lump modulation is detectable
with the Vera Rubin Observatory after six months of observation, up to $z\,
{=}\, 0.5$. We proposed a new, simple toy model that can be used, for instance,
to test the compatibility of the periodicity of BBH candidate sources with a

### [13] [The population of Galactic young massive star clusters in the TeV range](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21480)
*Rowan Batzofin,Pierre Cristofari,Kathrin Egberts*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the production of very-high-energy gamma rays by young massive star clusters (YMSCs) using Monte Carlo simulations and compares the results with observations from H.E.S.S. and LHAASO. It aims to determine particle spectra, cosmic-ray production efficiency, and magnetic field energy fractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the details of VHE gamma-ray emission from YMSCs, including particle spectra, cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency, and magnetic field energy conversion from stellar winds.

Method: Monte Carlo simulations are used to model YMSC populations and their gamma-ray emissions. The simulations are constrained by detected TeV YMSC subsamples and compared with H.E.S.S. and LHAASO catalogues.

Result: The study provides insights into the spectrum of accelerated particles, cosmic-ray production efficiency, and the fraction of wind luminosity converted into turbulent magnetic fields through comparison with observational data.

Conclusion: Comparisons with observational data help refine models of particle acceleration mechanisms and energetics in YMSCs, highlighting their potential as cosmic-ray sources.

Abstract: Young massive star clusters (YMSCs) can produce gamma rays in the
very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) range and have been proposed as sources that
can accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. Observations with current
instruments have lead to the detection of only a few YMSCs but future
instruments should significantly increase this number. However, the details of
the production of the VHE emission are not well understood: What is the
spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of cosmic-ray
production? What fraction of the wind luminosity is converted into the
turbulent magnetic field?
  To address these questions, we simulate the population of YMSCs in the
gamma-ray domain, by means of Monte Carlo methods, and apply the constraints
based on the subsample of YMSCs currently detected at TeV energies. We confront
our simulated populations with the catalogue of the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane
Survey and the First LHAASO Catalogue of Gamma-Ray Sources, allowing us to
investigate crucial aspects of particle acceleration at YMSCs.

### [14] [Multi-Messenger Search for Neutrino and Gravitational-Wave Emissions from Binary Black Holes Near Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21502)
*Leonardo Ricca,Matthias Vereecken,Christoph Raab,Mathieu Lamoureux,Giacomo Bruno,Gwenhaël De Wasseige*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from binary black holes near Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), using data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, IceCube, and the Quaia catalog to enhance multi-messenger astronomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of AGN environments on BBH formation and merger rates, and to explain observed high BBH masses through the detection of multi-messenger signals (GWs, neutrinos, and electromagnetic radiation).

Method: Combining gravitational-wave data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, neutrino data from IceCube, and AGN optical catalog data from Quaia to correlate events temporally and spatially. Sensitivity is assessed using sub-threshold GW candidates and public neutrino/AGN catalogs.

Result: The approach aims to identify potential sources and study their properties; a detection would be a breakthrough, though specific results are pending further analysis.

Conclusion: Successfully detecting such coincident signals would advance multi-messenger astrophysics, provide insights into BBH dynamics in AGNs, and help reconcile observed high-mass BBHs with formation models.

Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) in the vicinity of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs)
are particularly interesting systems from both a cosmological and astrophysical
point of view. Matter and radiation fields within the dense AGN environment
could produce electromagnetic and neutrino emission in addition to
gravitational waves (GWs). Moreover, interactions between BBHs and AGN
accretion disks are expected to influence BBH formation channels and merger
rates. Understanding these sources could help explain the unexpectedly high BBH
masses observed through GWs by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. We present
a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from AGNs. Our
innovative approach combines information from gravitational-wave data, neutrino
observations, and AGN optical catalogs to increase the chances of identifying
potential sources and studying their properties. We assess the sensitivity of
the search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino
Observatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog. A confident
detection of such an event would mark a breakthrough in multi-messenger
astronomy.

### [15] [Sco X-1 as a continuous gravitational waves source: modelling the secular evolution using MESA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21529)
*Gianluca Pagliaro,Maria Alessandra Papa,Jing Ming,Devina Misra*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the detectability of continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from Sco X-1, focusing on neutron star spin evolution, non-axisymmetric deformation mechanisms, and the impact of binary system parameters like accretion efficiency (η) and donor star mass (Mᵈ) on GW signal properties and detectability with current and future detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the likelihood of detecting GWs from Sco X-1, understand the progenitor systems that produce detectable signals, and assess how binary evolution parameters influence GW generation and observability, especially with upcoming 3G detectors.

Method: The study uses MESA code to model binary evolution from neutron star formation, incorporating accretion torque and GW torque effects from two deformation mechanisms (magnetic mountains and crustal breakage). Sensitivity thresholds for current and 3G detectors are analyzed to determine required ellipticity and signal frequency ranges.

Result: Current detectors require ε ≥ 1e-6 for detection, with maximum detectable frequency up to 360Hz depending on η. At 3G sensitivity, lower ellipticities (6e-9) are detectable, with frequency ranges from 600-1700Hz, varying with η and Mᵈ. Crustal breakage occurs only in specific parameter regimes, potentially producing highly detectable signals. Current detection probability is ~1%, rising to ~41% with 3G.

Conclusion: Sco X-1's GW detectability hinges on progenitor binary parameters and deformation mechanisms. 3G detectors significantly improve prospects, particularly if crustal breakage occurred during its active phase. Observations could constrain neutron star structure and accretion physics.

Abstract: We study the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves (GWs)
from Sco X-1 and evaluate the most likely waveform- and progenitor- parameters.
We study the evolution of different Sco X-1 progenitors, identifying those that
give rise to detectable signals. We model the spin evolution of the neutron
star (NS) by the accretion torque and the GW torque. We consider two mechanisms
for generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the GW torque: i) magnetic
mountains and ii) deformation after crustal breakage. Both torques are
intertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the
NS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA,
starting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a
magnetic ellipticity of $\varepsilon\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for
detection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases
with the accretion efficiency $\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G
(Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs,
with ellipticities as small as $6\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the
waveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of
detectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on
$\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\eta\leq$30%, the crust
does not break. When $\eta\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with
$M^d\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\eta\geq$70%
all crusts break. In some systems the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase.
If Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW
signal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies. We estimate
current detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability
increases substantially -- to around 41% -- with third-generation detectors.

### [16] [From nuclear star clusters to Little Red Dots: black hole growth, mergers, and tidal disruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21709)
*Konstantinos Kritos,Joseph Silk*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the origin and evolution of Little Red Dots using a nuclear star cluster model, incorporating tidal disruptions, black hole captures, and gas accretion to explain their rapid black hole growth and x-ray properties at high redshifts (z=4-6).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the rapid mass growth of supermassive black holes in Little Red Dots observed by JWST and explain their low X-ray luminosity.

Method: Developed a nuclear star cluster model that accounts for tidal disruption events, black holes captures, and gas accretion. Used observed Little Red Dots' number density and reasonable assumptions for predictions.

Result: Predicted tens of tidal disruption events and black hole captures at z=4-6, with TDEs being ~10x more frequent than capture events. Discussed uncertainties and low X-ray luminosity implications.

Conclusion: The model supports the hypothesis that Little Red Dots host growing supermassive black holes via the outlined processes and highlights the need for future observations to confirm predictions and refine X-ray luminosity understanding.

Abstract: Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are
hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole,
possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and
likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear
star cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the
supermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black
hole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our
model. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under
reasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption
events and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal
disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture
rate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we
comment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.

### [17] [Natural supersymmetry at a muon collider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20920)
*Howard Baer,Vernon Barger,Jessica Bolich,Dibyashree Sengupta,Kairui Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the potential of muon colliders at different energies to study natural supersymmetry (SUSY), particularly focusing on their ability to target 2-body reaction thresholds and Higgs boson resonances, given the broad mass range of sparticles in such models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the capabilities of muon colliders in investigating natural SUSY scenarios, especially those emerging from the string landscape where sparticle masses span two orders of magnitude. This is crucial for BSM physics as natural SUSY remains a leading candidate beyond the Standard Model.

Method: The analysis examines how variable-energy muon colliders can be optimized to detect sparticles via 2-body reaction thresholds and Higgs resonances, considering the wide mass spectrum characteristic of natural SUSY models.

Result: The study highlights that muon colliders with adjustable CoM energies (1-14 TeV) are highly effective for probing natural SUSY by precisely targeting specific interaction thresholds and Higgs boson resonances, thereby enabling detailed exploration of sparticle masses and interactions.

Conclusion: Muon colliders provide a versatile tool for investigating natural SUSY, particularly when tuned to specific energy ranges. Their flexibility in adjusting CoM energies makes them essential for exploring the comprehensive mass spectrum of sparticles in BSM scenarios like those from the string landscape.

Abstract: There is great interest within the particle physics community for building a
$\mu^+\mu^-$ collider with center-of-mass (CoM) energies ranging from
$\sqrt{s}\sim$ 1-14 TeV. For Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics, natural
supersymmetry seems perhaps the most motivated, plausible extension of the
Standard Model. Here, we examine what can be accomplished by a muon collider
with regards to natural SUSY at various muon collider CoM energies. In natural
SUSY -- especially in the guise that would emerge from the string landscape --
one expects sparticles to be spread over two orders of magnitude in mass
values. A muon collider with highly variable beam energies would be most useful
for targeting 2-body reaction thresholds and Higgs boson resonances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the nonleptonic two-body weak decays of the single bottom
baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ into $\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ final states within the
framework of QCD factorization. Employing the QCD factorization framework and
incorporating the contributions from the current-current operators, we compute
the decay amplitudes and decay widths of the
$\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ processes in terms of the
$\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ transition form factors. Here, $P$
and $V$ denote pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Using the form
factors obtained in our previous work, we evaluate the numerical values of the
decay widths and branching fractions for all relevant weak channels. This study
complements our previous analysis of the semileptonic weak transitions
$\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ reported in
Ref.~\cite{Amiri:2025gcf}, thereby providing a comprehensive investigation of
all possible $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ weak decays of the

### [19] [Electromagnetic Leptogenesis--an EFT-Consistent Analysis via Wilson Coefficients II: Low-Scale, Resonant Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21089)
*Rin Takada*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that resonant electromagnetic leptogenesis in the low-scale regime (around 100 GeV) can successfully generate the observed baryon asymmetry through EFT methods, achieving adequate values even under strong washout conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether low-scale resonant electromagnetic leptogenesis, using an EFT approach with proper resummation and transport theory, can overcome previous challenges and produce the observed baryon asymmetry within experimental constraints.

Method: The authors start with a UV Lagrangian, derive the gauge-invariant dipole operator O_NB with its Wilson coefficient C_NB via one-loop matching, apply Pilaftsis-Underwood resummation for CP asymmetries, and use flavor-covariant transport equations across the electroweak phase transition. They analyze the quasi-degenerate neutrino mass spectrum region for resonant enhancement.

Result: In the quasi-degenerate limit, the CP-odd source gets Breit-Wigner-enhanced while washout processes saturate. The resulting baryon asymmetry at freeze-out reaches ~1e-10, exceeding the observed 8.7e-11 even in strong washout scenarios.

Conclusion: Resonant electromagnetic leptogenesis at ~100 GeV is confirmed as a viable EFT-based mechanism for generating the universe's baryon asymmetry, valid within current particle physics frameworks.

Abstract: We study electromagnetic leptogenesis (EMLG) in the low-scale, resonant
regime within a fully effective-field-theory (EFT)--consistent framework.
Starting from a UV Lagrangian and performing a one-loop matching to obtain the
gauge-invariant dipole operator $O_{NB}$ with its Wilson coefficient $C_{NB}$,
we implement the Pilaftsis--Underwood resummation for the self-energy
contributions to the CP asymmetries and evolve a flavour covariant transport
system across the electroweak window. In the quasi-degenerate limit
$M_m-M_i\simeq\varGamma_m/2$, the CP-odd source acquires a Breit--Wigner--form
enhancement whereas the washout saturates, with the freeze-out baryon asymmetry
achieving $Y_B^{\rm FO}\gtrsim 10^{-10}$ across the strong-washout regime,
comfortably above the observed value $Y_B^{\rm obs}\simeq 8.7\times 10^{-11}$.
This establishes resonant EMLG at $O(100)~{\rm GeV}$ as a viable EFT-based
mechanism for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.

### [20] [WimPyC: an extension module of WimPyDD for the calculation of WIMP capture in celestial bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21185)
*Sunghyun Kang,Stefano Scopel,Gaurav Tomar*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents WimPyC, an extended Python tool built upon WimPyDD to compute WIMP capture rates in celestial bodies using nuclear scattering in the optically thin regime. It supports Galilean-invariant non-relativistic effective theory, accommodating inelastic scattering, arbitrary WIMP spin, and customizable velocity distributions. The code separates calculations into Wilson coefficients, response functions, and halo functions for efficiency and flexibility in both top-down and bottom-up studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a versatile tool that can model WIMP capture in celestial bodies within a comprehensive theoretical framework, allowing for both model-dependent and model-independent analyses. It extends previous work (WimPyDD) to include celestial capture computations, enabling combined studies of direct detection and capture scenarios.

Method: WimPyC extends WimPyDD by incorporating the calculation of WIMP capture rates through nuclear scattering, maintaining the factorized approach of separating Wilson coefficients, nuclear response functions, and halo velocity distributions. It uses interpolation of precomputed components to enhance efficiency. The code supports NREFT with various interaction types and velocity distributions, including stream-based models.

Result: WimPyC provides an efficient and flexible computational framework that simplifies the analysis of WIMP capture rates across diverse astrophysical and particle physics scenarios. By precomputing and storing components separately, it speeds up calculations and allows for modular exploration of parameters in both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

Conclusion: The introduction of WimPyC offers a powerful tool for researchers to explore WIMP interactions in celestial bodies under varied conditions, bridging high-energy physics models with observational constraints from direct detection and astrophysical data. Its modular design facilitates both detailed model predictions and agnostic parameter scans.

Abstract: We introduce WimPyC, a Python code for the calculation of the capture rate of
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) by celestial bodies through
nuclear scattering in the optically thin regime. WimPyC is an extension of the
WimPyDD code, that calculates WIMP-nucleus scattering signals in direct
detection (DD) experiments, and allows to combine DD and capture in celestial
bodies in virtually any scenario within the framework of Galilean-invariant
non-relativistic effective theory (NREFT), including inelastic scattering, an
arbitrary WIMP spin and a generic WIMP velocity distribution in the Galactic
halo. WimPyDD and WimPyC are suitable for both top-down approaches, where the
interaction operators of a high-energy physics model are matched to those of
the NREFT, and to bottom-up studies, where the Wilson coefficients of the NREFT
are explored in a model-independent way and/or where the velocity distribution
is written in terms of a superposition of streams taken as free parameters. As
in the case of WimPyDD WimPyC exploits the factorization of the three main
components that enter in the calculation of the capture rate: i) the Wilson
coefficients that encode the dependence of the signals on the ultraviolet
completion of the effective theory; ii) a response function that depends on the
nuclear physics; iii) the halo function that depends on the WIMP velocity
distribution. In WimPyC these three components are calculated and stored
separately for later interpolation and combined together only as the last step
of the signal evaluation procedure. This makes the phenomenological study of
the capture rate with WimPyC transparent and improves computational speed.

### [21] [$a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ excitation in the $D^+ \to π^+ ηη$ decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21316)
*Jing Song,Yi-Yao Li,Melahat Bayar,Eulogio Oset*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the anomalous high-mass enhancement in the $\pi\eta$ invariant mass distribution of the $D^+ \to \pi^+ 
\eta 
\eta$ decay observed by BESIII. After ruling out contributions from triangle mechanisms and other resonances like $f_0(1370)$, $f_0$, $a_0$, and $f_2$, the authors conclude that excitation of the $f_0(980)$ resonance—decaying to $\eta\eta$ and linked to $a_0(980)$ production—accounts for both the high-mass anomaly and an unexpected deficit in the low-mass $\eta\eta$ distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the unexpected high-mass enhancement in the $\pi\eta$ mass spectrum of the $D^+$ decay, and address discrepancies in the $\eta\eta$ invariant mass distribution when only $a_0(980)$ is considered.

Method: The study systematically evaluates proposed mechanisms (triangle diagrams, $f_0(1370)$ resonance) and tests contributions from other resonances ($f_0$, $a_0$, $f_2$). Ultimately, they model the $f_0(980)$ resonance excitation coupled with $a_0(980)$ production and its decay to two $\eta$ mesons.

Result: Contributions from triangle diagrams and suggested resonances (except $f_0(980)$) are insufficient to explain the anomaly. The $f_0(980) \to \eta\eta$ excitation explains both the high-mass $\pi\eta$ excess and corrects the low-mass deficit in $\eta\eta$ distribution.

Conclusion: The $f_0(980)$ resonance plays a crucial role in resolving the observed anomalies in $D^+$ decay by simultaneously accounting for the high-mass $\pi\eta$ enhancement and fixing the $\eta\eta$ invariant mass distribution's low-mass deficiency. Prior hypotheses involving other resonances are invalidated.

Abstract: We have made a thorough study of the $D^+ \to \pi^+ \eta \eta $ reaction,
recently measured by the BESIII collaboration, which shows an abnormal strength
at high invariant masses in the $\pi\eta$ mass distribution. We studied in
detail the triangle mechanism and the $f_0(1370)$ excitation modes that have
been suggested to explain this abnormal feature, and concluded that they are
too small to have any important role in the solution to that problem. We have
also studied other possible solutions evaluating the contribution of
excitations of other $f_0$, $a_0$ and $f_2$ resonances and reached the same
conclusion. Unexpectedly, the solution to the problem is found considering the
$f_0(980)$ excitation, with the $f_0(980)$ decaying to two $\eta$, which is
tied to the $a_0(980)$ production, and well under control. At the same time,
the consideration of the $f_0(980)$ excitation solves another non reported
problem, which is the $\eta \eta$ mass distribution that comes when only the
$a_0(980)$ resonance is allowed to be excited, which produces a large
deficiency at low invariant masses compared with experiment.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates the process e+ e- -> J/psi J/psi up to NNLO at sqrt(s)=10.58 GeV using an improved NRQCD factorization approach, showing positive convergence in corrections and high prospects for observation with Belle II's 50 ab^-1 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately predict the production cross-section of double J/psi particles at high precision, ensuring reliable interpretation of experimental data from Belle II with its large dataset.

Method: The method uses improved NRQCD factorization, separating the amplitude into photon-fragmentation and non-fragmentation components. The fragmentation part uses measured J/psi decay constants, while interference and non-fragmentation parts are computed at NNLO in alpha_s and leading velocity order.

Result: NNLO calculations show positive alpha_s corrections with good convergence, non-fragmentation contribution is negligible. The results suggest strong potential for observing exclusive double J/psi production with Belle II's planned data.

Conclusion: The improved NRQCD approach provides a reliable framework for precise predictions. With Belle II's 50 ab^-1 dataset, observing double J/psi production is highly feasible, supporting future experimental validation.

Abstract: We report the calculation of the process $e^+ e^- \to J/\psi J/\psi$ up to
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) at a center-of-mass (CM) energy of
$\sqrt{s}=10.58$ GeV. We employ an improved NRQCD factorization approach,
decomposing the amplitude into photon-fragmentation and non-fragmentation
components. The fragmentation contribution is determined using the measured
$J/\psi$ decay constant, while the interference and non-fragmentation parts are
computed at NNLO in $\alpha_s$ and lowest order in velocity. In this optimized
scheme, both ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ and ${\cal O}(\alpha^2_s)$ corrections in the
interference part are positive and exhibit good convergence. The
non-fragmentation part is numerically insignificant. Our results indicate that
with the projected 50 ${\rm ab}^{-1}$ dataset at \texttt{Belle 2}, the
prospects for observing exclusive double $J/\psi$ production are very
promising.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the semileptonic decay of the Λ_c baryon using light-cone QCD sum rules with two sets of distribution amplitudes. The form factors are expanded using a z-series and predict branching fractions consistent with experimental data and lattice-QCD results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the Λ_c → Λ ℓ⁺ν_ℓ decay and compare theoretical predictions with BESIII measurements and lattice-QCD results, ensuring accuracy in form factor calculations.

Method: Applied light-cone QCD sum rules (LCSR) using heavy Λ_c baryon distribution amplitudes. Evaluated form factors via z-series expansion and calculated decay widths with two amplitude sets.

Result: Branching fraction predictions align well with BESIII data and lattice-QCD. Form factors' z-series expansion provided model-independent parametrization.

Conclusion: LCSR method validity confirmed for Λ_c decay studies. Agreement with experiments supports the reliability of distribution amplitudes and calculation approach.

Abstract: We study the semileptonic decay of its SU(3) partner, the $\Lambda_c \to
\Lambda \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ ($\ell = e, \mu$) transition, within the framework of
light-cone QCD sum rules (LCSR) by using the distribution amplitudes of heavy
$\Lambda_c$ baryon. The numerical analysis is performed using two different
sets of $\Lambda_c$ baryon light-cone distribution amplitudes. The resulting
form factors are parametrized by a model-independent $z$-series expansion and
used to compute the differential and total decay widths. Our predictions for
the branching fractions are in good agreement with the latest BESIII
measurements and with lattice-QCD results.

### [24] [The Standard Model partial unification scale as a guide to new physics model building](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21420)
*Isabella Masina,Mariano Quiros*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The Standard Model's partial gauge coupling unification at ~10^16 GeV can potentially achieve full unification via new physics corrections, particularly if those corrections to non-Abelian couplings are similar. Models like supersymmetry or string-inspired scenarios with a low string scale (~100 TeV) are viable options under this framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore conditions under which the Standard Model's partial unification can be extended to full unification with new physics above the standard scale, examining scenarios where non-Abelian coupling corrections lead to unification scales either close to the existing ~10^16 GeV or much lower (~100 TeV).

Method: Parametrizing new physics contributions affecting gauge couplings such that equal/non-negligible corrections to non-Abelian (SU(3), SU(2)) couplings maintain the unification scale near ~10^16 GeV, while significantly different corrections could shift the scale. Testing this framework against models including low-energy supersymmetry, split supersymmetry, and string theories with a desert up to M_X.

Result: Full unification either occurs at the original~10^16 GeV scale (with similar non-Abelian corrections) or a much lower scale (~100 TeV) in string-inspired models, the latter suggesting a low string scale. Existing models like minimal supersymmetry naturally fit within the parametrization without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: A general framework links new physics contributions to gauge coupling unification scales. While conservative scenarios align with traditional GUT scales, novel possibilities emerge for a low string scale, opening experimental avenues to test these predictions through probes at ~100 TeV or beyond.

Abstract: In the Standard Model, partial unification of the non-Abelian running gauge
couplings is achieved at the scale $\mu^{\rm SM}_{32} \approx 2.8 \times
10^{16}$ GeV. Elaborating on this fact, we discuss a simple general
parametrization for the new physics corrections leading to full unification at
some scale $M_X$. We show that for any new physics model such that the
corrections to the non-Abelian couplings are equal (or nearly so), $M_X$ is
equal (or close to) the partial unification scale $\mu^{\rm SM}_{32}$; the
latter scales could be disentangled only if the corrections to the non-Abelian
couplings are significantly different. We explore how the parametrization works
for some relevant models with new physics below $M_X$, as low energy
supersymmetry, split supersymmetry, etc. As for models with a desert up to
$M_X$, we explore in particular how the parametrization works for string
inspired corrections; we find a phenomenologically remarkable possibility for
unification at about $100$ TeV, suggesting a low string scale, in addition to
the more conservative possibility for unification at $\mu^{\rm SM}_{32}$.

*S. Alekhin,M. V. Garzelli,S. Moch,O. Zenaiev*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study determines the strong coupling constant α_s(m_Z) using high-energy data from various experiments, applying strict kinematic cuts to minimize power corrections. With Q² > 10 GeV² and excluding higher-twist effects, they find α_s(m_Z, N_f=5) = 0.1152 ± 0.008. Looser cuts worsen the fit and increase α_s.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately measure the strong coupling constant α_s(m_Z) by suppressing non-perturbative power corrections through kinematic cuts, ensuring reliable results from QCD calculations at high energy scales.

Method: Combined analysis of Drell-Yan, top-quark, DIS, and fixed-target data using NNLO QCD and LO QED in MS̄-scheme. Applied stringent cuts (W² ≥12.5 GeV² and increasing Q² thresholds) to DIS data to exclude low-Q² regions sensitive to higher-twist effects.

Result: With Q² >10 GeV² and higher-twist terms discarded, α_s(m_Z,N_f=5)=0.1152 ±0.008. Looser cuts lead to higher α_s values, up to ~2σ increase, indicating power corrections contaminate low-Q² data.

Conclusion: Kinematic cuts essential for isolating perturbative QCD regime. Obtained precise α_s value under strict cuts, highlighting the necessity of excluding low-Q² data to avoid systematic uncertainties from power corrections.

Abstract: We determine the strong coupling from high-energy data for the Drell-Yan (DY)
process and top-quark hadro-production collected at the Large Hadron Collider
and the Tevatron combined with the world data on deep-inelastic scattering
(DIS) and fixed-target DY data. The theory description uses results at
next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD in the
$\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-scheme together with leading order QED evolution. The
DIS data are subject to stringent kinematic cuts to suppress the contribution
of power corrections. We apply a cut on the hadronic invariant mass squared
$W^2 \geq 12.5~$GeV$^2$ together with a series of cuts on momentum transfer
squared $Q^2$. Discarding higher-twist terms we find that the value of strong
coupling $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ preferred by the data stabilizes at large enough cuts
on $Q^2$, when low-$Q^2$ DIS data sensitive to power corrections are
effectively removed. In particular, we extract the value of
$\alpha_s(m_Z,N_f=5)=0.1152 \pm 0.008$ for $N_f=5$ light flavors with the cut
$Q^2>10~$GeV$^2$. In the absence of higher-twist terms less tight cuts on $Q^2$
show a clear deterioration of the fit and lead to rising values of the strong
coupling, shifted upwards by about two standard deviations.

*Giulio Barni,Simone Blasi,Eric Madge,Miguel Vanvlasselaer*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates gravitational wave signals from both direct and inverse cosmological phase transitions using the sound shell model, aiming to distinguish their observable features in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the distinct gravitational wave signatures of direct versus inverse phase transitions and improve detection capabilities for new physics in the early Universe.

Method: Applied the sound shell model to derive and compare gravitational wave spectra from sound waves produced during direct (bubble-driven) and inverse (plasma-sucked) phase transitions.

Result: Demonstrated differing phenomenological outcomes between the two transition types, offering new criteria to discriminate fluid dynamics scenarios using gravitational wave observations.

Conclusion: Inverse transitions produce detectably unique gravitational wave patterns, enhancing prospects for identifying early Universe phase transitions through upcoming gravitational wave experiments.

Abstract: Cosmological phase transitions are a frequent phenomenon in particle physics
models beyond the Standard Model, and the corresponding gravitational wave
signal offers a key probe of new physics in the early Universe. Depending on
the underlying microphysics, the transition can exhibit either direct or
inverse hydrodynamics, leading to a different phenomenology. Most studies to
date have focused on direct transitions, where the cosmic fluid is pushed or
dragged by the expanding vacuum bubbles. In contrast, inverse phase transitions
are characterized by fluid profiles where the plasma is sucked in by the
expanding bubbles. Using the sound shell model, we derive and compare the
gravitational wave spectra from sound waves for direct and inverse phase
transitions, providing new insights into the potential observable features and
the possibility of discriminating among the various fluid solutions in
gravitational wave experiments.

*F. Herzog,B. Ruijl,T. Ueda,J. Vermaseren,A. Vogt*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the calculation of five-loop (N^4LO) beta function contributions in QCD, QED, and non-Abelian gauge theories, along with related analytic and numerical results, including Higgs-boson decay and quark distribution splitting functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance precision calculations in perturbative QCD and related theories by extending beta function computations to five loops, enabling more accurate predictions for particle physics processes and facilitating subsequent complex five-loop analyses.

Method: The authors used advanced computational techniques tailored for high-loop perturbative calculations in gauge theories, leveraging specialized tools developed during the project. They applied these methods to compute beta functions, analyze Higgs-boson decay in the heavy-top quark limit, and derive splitting functions for quark distributions.

Result: The five-loop beta function coefficients were determined, providing insights into the renormalization group evolution. Numerical results include Higgs decay rates and estimates for quark cusp anomalous dimensions, showcasing the methodology's effectiveness in handling complex five-loop computations.

Conclusion: The successful five-loop calculations demonstrate the capability of modern computational tools in advancing theoretical particle physics, laying groundwork for future precise predictions in QCD and related areas. Specifically, derived splitting functions offer the first realistic five-loop estimates for cusp anomalous dimensions.

Abstract: At the end of 2016, we computed the five-loop (N$^4$LO) contributions to the
beta function in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), its generalization
to non-Abelian gauge theories with a simple compact Lie group, and for Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED). Here we recall main tools used in and specifically
developed for this computation and its main analytic and numerical results. The
development work carried out for this project facilitated further even more
involved analytic five-loop computations. We briefly summarize also their
numerical QCD results for Higgs-boson decay to hadrons in the heavy-top limit
and for two N$^4$LO splitting functions for the evolution of quark
distributions of hadrons. The latter lead to a first realistic estimate of the
five-loop contribution to another important quantity in perturbative QCD, the
quark cusp anomalous dimension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision predictions for gg→γγ processes at the LHC by incorporating electroweak corrections from first-two generation quarks, essential for high-precision measurements in particle physics.

Method: Used projection operators to compute scalar form factors, evaluated Master Integrals with generalized polylogarithms and Chen-iterated integrals, applied a semi-numerical fitting procedure for efficient evaluation of complex higher-weight contributions.

Result: Observed ~2% electroweak corrections to leading-order cross-sections at the LHC. Implemented results in MCFM for phenomenological studies.

Conclusion: Demonstrated the importance of electroweak corrections for high-precision LHC analyses. The semi-numerical method provides efficient evaluations necessary for accurate predictions in collider physics.

Abstract: We present the electroweak corrections for the production of a photon pair
through gluon fusion, focusing on the contribution from the first two
generations of quarks. The two-loop amplitude is calculated using a series of
projection operators which define scalar form factors. In order to evaluate the
Master Integrals which appear in this process we employ both generalized
polylogarithms and Chen-iterated integrals. In order to perform a
phenomenological study we develop a semi-numerical evaluation of the Master
Integrals employing a fitting procedure to speed up the evaluation of
burdensome higher weight contributions. We present results for the LHC, finding
corrections of around a couple of percent to the leading order $gg \rightarrow
\gamma\gamma$ process. Our results are implemented into the parton-level Monte
Carlo code \texttt{MCFM}.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Compton process with the initial states of photons and neutrons described
by the density matrices of a general form is studied for low energies of
photons. The coherent contribution to the inclusive probability to record a
photon is investigated in detail. This contribution gives the hologram of the
neutron one-particle density matrix. The evolution of the Stokes parameters of
scattered photons is described. The susceptibility tensor of a neutron gas and
a wave packet of a single neutron is obtained. The explicit expression for the
photon polarization operator in the presence of free neutrons is derived. It
turns out that this polarization operator possesses pole singularities in the
short wavelength approximation. These singularities corresponding to the
additional degrees of freedom are identified with plasmons and the respective
plasmon-polaritons are described. There are eight independent plasmon-polariton
modes in a neutron gas and on a single neutron wave packet. Some
plasmon-polariton modes prove to be tachyonic and unstable manifesting a
spontaneous generation of the magnetic field. The estimates of the parameters
of the neutron gas when it becomes ferromagnetic are found. In the infrared
limit, the neutron wave packet behaves in coherent Compton scattering as a
point particle with dynamical magnetic moment, the additional degrees of
freedom being reduced to the dynamical part of the magnetic moment.

TL;DR: Presents a soft operator for approximating one-loop QCD amplitudes with massive quarks and derives the subleading term for collinear quark-anti-quark amplitudes, essential for handling high-energy processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complete the framework for approximating one-loop amplitudes in QCD with massive quarks in the soft gluon limit and provide necessary collinear limits for calculations involving quark-anti-quark pairs.

Method: Develops a soft operator acting on color and spin space to maintain on-shell conditions and momentum conservation, alongside deriving subleading collinear expansion terms for massless quark-anti-quark pairs.

Result: Successful construction of the soft operator and collinear expansion terms, incorporating high-energy limit aspects critical for one-loop approximations.

Conclusion: These results finalize the tools needed for accurate one-loop QCD amplitude calculations in soft gluon and collinear quark-anti-quark scenarios, advancing high-energy physics computations.

Abstract: We provide the last missing ingredient necessary to approximate one-loop
amplitudes in QCD with massive quarks in the limit of vanishing energy of a
single gluon up to terms suppressed by this energy. Our main result is a soft
operator acting in color and spin space that manipulates the momenta of the
hard partons while keeping them on-shell and respecting momentum conservation.
Additionally, we provide a complete expression for the subleading term of the
expansion of an arbitrary tree-level amplitude in the limit where the momenta
of a massless quark and a massless anti-quark of the same flavor become
collinear. This limit is necessary to obtain the one-loop soft approximation
whenever the process involves such a quark-anti-quark pair. Interestingly, the
result involves a high-energy limit.

*Rikpratik Sengupta,Chiranjeeb Singha*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines gravitational collapse in a 5-dimensional braneworld model, showing that braneworld effects prevent singularity formation by keeping scalar curvature finite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how extra-dimensional braneworld physics alters gravitational collapse outcomes, particularly regarding singularities and spacetime structures differing from Einstein's theory.

Method: Modeled interior collapse with Friedmann-Lemaitre spacetime and exterior with Vaidya radiation envelope transitioning to Reissner-Nordström geometry with positive tidal charge in Shtanov-Sahni braneworld framework.

Result: Braneworld effects maintain finite brane tension and bounded scalar curvature, avoiding singularities despite Birkhoff's theorem breakdown. The exterior doesn't stabilize into a static configuration until effects subside.

Conclusion: Braneworld models fundamentally change gravitational collapse dynamics by suppressing singularity formation through tidal effects from the extra dimension, offering new insights into quantum gravity implications.

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous dust cloud in the
Shtanov Sahni braneworld model, which incorporates an extra timelike dimension.
The interior of the collapsing configuration is modeled by a Friedmann Lemaitre
spacetime, while the exterior is described by a Vaidya radiation envelope that
eventually settles into a static Reissner Nordstrom (RN) geometry with a
positive tidal charge. Although a smooth matching between the interior and the
static exterior is precluded by the breakdown of Birkhoff's theorem in the
braneworld scenario, we show that as long as braneworld effects remain
significant, the brane tension stays finite. Consequently, the scalar curvature
remains bounded, thereby preventing the formation of a singularity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of
gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their
detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals'
complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search
strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform
templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single
mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection
statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is
modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The
pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency,
enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on
a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at
$\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the
frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping
the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show
that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision
estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a
computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the
LISA global fit.

Abstract: We study the thermodynamic topology and microscopic interaction properties of
charged black holes in RegMax gravity, focusing on the role of the coupling
parameter $\alpha$. Using the Duan topological current method together with
Ruppeiner geometry, we show that $\alpha$ controls a sharp change in phase
structure. Above a certain critical threshold, we find that the Duan defect
curve develops an intermediate branch and vertical tangency points, producing
continuous (second-order) critical behaviour. Furthermore, the Ruppeiner
curvature becomes negative at very small horizon radii before turning positive
and progressively vanishing at larger radii. By contrast, below the critical
value of the coupling, the intermediate black hole phase disappears, and the
system shows a simpler small/large first-order/coexistence behaviour driven by
free-energy competition. In this regime, the Ruppeiner curvature remains
predominantly positive. Overall, increasing $\alpha$ enriches the thermodynamic
topology (allowing for second-order criticality) while simultaneously reducing
the domain in which classical energy conditions (ECs) are satisfied, thus
linking exotic thermodynamic behaviour to more severe violations of standard
energy conditions.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of regular
black holes, driven by the search for singularity-free geometries. This
research has revealed intriguing similarities between the regularization
mechanisms used in black hole models and those employed in quantum field
theory, such as the introduction of exponential suppression or energy cutoffs.
We propose a systematic exponential cutoff regularization scheme for static,
spherically symmetric black hole solutions in general relativity. The method
explored in this paper serves as an alternative to the black-bounce singularity
suppression mechanism proposed by Simpson and Visser, which involves a
coordinate remapping $r \rightarrow\sqrt{r^2+a^2}$, as well as to the mechanism
proposed by Bronnikov, which employs a Bardeen-type remapping in the metric.
The method presented here introduces exponential factors in the mass function,
smoothing curvature divergences and ensuring geodesic completeness under
specific conditions. This approach allows the regularization of known singular
spacetimes without altering their asymptotic structure. We analyze curvature
invariants, horizon formation, and thermodynamic properties, showing that the
regularized geometries avoid singularities while maintaining physical
consistency. As examples of application, we regularize the Schwarzschild black
hole and present a novel regularized Kiselev solution. The method provides a
unified framework to systematically generate singularity-free black holes
within classical general relativity

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Using ray-tracing techniques, this paper investigates the optical and
polarization images of rotating black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity
illuminated by thick accretion disks. We consider two accretion disk models:
the phenomenological model and the HOU disk model, where the phenomenological
model includes both isotropic and anisotropic radiation. In all models, the
external bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal
dark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high
observational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation
from the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin
accretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic
radiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the
vertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the HOU disk
model, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical
approximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the
phenomenological model. Furthermore, we find that an increase in the rotational
parameter $a$ leads to an asymmetry in the intensity distribution of the
high-order image, while an increase in the spontaneous Lorentz violating
parameters, $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$, results in a decrease in the size of the
high-order image. In the polarization image, the linear polarization is found
to be significantly influenced by the intensity, while it is relatively less
affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$. The electric vector
position angle is mainly affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$.

Abstract: We investigate the superradiant instability of Kerr-Newman black holes in the
presence of a massive, charged scalar field using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas
(VBK) method. We study the solutions of the exact polynomial condition for
quasibound state frequencies and determine the domain of superradiant
instability in parameter space without relying on the hydrogenic approximation
or numerics. We derive the minimum scalar mass needed for quasibound states to
exist, and identify the precise overlap region between the quasibound and
superradiant conditions where instability can occur. Through a perturbative
analysis of the resonance equation, we obtain analytic expressions for the
instability boundaries and growth rates, and clarify their relation to previous
numerical results. Our analysis reveals how the instability region shifts from
nearly neutral Kerr black holes for light fields to highly charged
near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes for heavier fields, while remaining
absent in the Reissner-Nordstrom limit.

TL;DR: The paper discusses improvements in the cWB-2G pipeline for detecting gravitational wave transients using machine learning and multi-detector networks, enhancing search flexibility and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection of gravitational wave transients (GWTs) without assuming signal characteristics, ensuring robust model testing and enabling discovery of unknown sources.

Method: The cWB-2G pipeline uses multivariate classification with XGBoost for signal ranking, validates statistical significance, measures correlations between searches, and compares performance across 2 vs. 3 detector networks.

Result: Enhanced search performance shown through 14.8 days of LVK data, validated statistical accuracy, and improved detection via multi-detector combinations. Demonstrates superiority of 3-detector networks and combined search strategies.

Conclusion: The upgraded cWB-2G provides critical tools for current and future LVK searches, emphasizing the value of adaptable, multi-detector approaches for generic GWT detection.

Abstract: The most general searches for gravitational wave transients (GWTs) rely on
data analysis methods that do not assume prior knowledge of the signal
waveform, direction, or arrival time on Earth. These searches provide
data-driven signal reconstructions that are crucial both for testing available
emission models and for discovering yet-to-be-uncovered sources. Here, we
discuss progress in the detection performance of the coherent WaveBurst
second-generation pipeline (cWB-2G), which is highly adaptable to both
minimally modeled and model-informed searches for GWTs. Several search
configurations for GWTs are examined using approximately 14.8 days of
observation time from the third observing run by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). Recent
enhancements include a ranking statistic fully based on multivariate
classification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting, a thorough validation of the
statistical significance accuracy of GWT candidates, and a measurement of the
correlations of false alarms and simulated detections between different
concurrent searches. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive comparison
of cWB-2G performance on data from networks made of two and three detectors,
and we demonstrate the advantage of combining concurrent searches for GWTs of
generic morphology in a global observatory. This work offers essential insights
for assessing our data analysis strategies in ongoing and future LVK searches
for generic GWTs.

TL;DR: The paper examines a logarithmic-modified teleparallel gravity model's late-time cosmological expansion effects, using cosmological chronometers and supernova data to fit parameters, resulting in an accelerated expansion with q ≈ -0.435 and behavior akin to quintessence/phantom models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore modified gravity theories that explain late-time cosmic acceleration without暗 energy, specifically through logarithmic corrections to teleparallel gravity, which may better fit astronomical observations than standard models.

Method: The authors utilize a quadratic expansion parametrization of H(z) and fit parameters using cosmological chronometers data and Pantheon+SH0ES supernova data. They analyze energy density, pressure, and state parameter ω in the modified teleparallel model.

Result: The model yields an accelerated expansion (q = -0.435 ± 0.028) and energy parameters matching quintessence/phantom models, suggesting it can explain cosmic acceleration through modified gravity without暗 energy.

Conclusion: Logarithmic-modified teleparallel gravity provides a viable alternative to暗 energy models, producing acceleration and dark energy-like behavior through gravitational geometry modifications rather than introducing new fields.

Abstract: We study the late-time cosmological expansion of a modified teleparallel
gravity model of type logarithmic type. This modified gravitational lagrangian
yields a cosmological constant term and also power-law corrections to the
teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) for small $\lambda$. By
using the cosmological chronometers and the type Ia supernove data from the
Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, we fit the parameters of the modified gravitational
dynamics assuming $H(z)$ parametrized by a quadratic expansion. The results
exhibit an accelerated expansion with parameter $q = - 0.435 \pm 0.028$. In
addition, we analyzed the effective energy density, pressure and state
parameter $\omega$. It turns out that, this modified gravitational theory
produces solutions similar to the quintessence and phantom models.

Abstract: We argue that the standard post-Newtonian expansion scheme used in General

find solutions from their field equations that sustain the velocity rotation

Motivation: Astrophysical black holes are surrounded by plasma, so understanding its effect on light trajectories is crucial for accurate shadow observations.

Method: Analyzing null geodesics in rotating hairy Horndeski black hole spacetimes with plasma using the Hamilton-Jacobi method, considering uniform and non-uniform plasma distributions.

Result: The study shows plasma distributions and hair parameters influence the black hole shadow's shape and size. Comparisons with EHT M87* data help constrain plasma parameters.

Conclusion: Plasma properties and black hole 'hair' parameters significantly affect shadow measurements, providing a pathway to test Horndeski theories against observational data like EHT.

Abstract: Exploring the influence of plasma on the light rays trajectories in the
vicinity of black holes is significat since that astrophysical black holes are
generally surrounded by a plasma medium. In this work, we analyze the null
geodesics in the space-time of rotating hairy Horndeski black holes immersed in
a plasma medium using the Hamilton-Jacobi method. By considering both uniform
and non-uniform plasma distributions, we perform a comparative study of their
effects on the black hole shadow. The impact of the hair parameter and the
inclination angle on the black hole shadow is also investigated. Finally, the
shadow results are compared with observational data of the Event Horizon
Telescope for M87* to constrain the plasma parameter.

*Marco A. A. de Paula,Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper studies regular black holes (RBHs) derived from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) within the h-family, focusing on photon motion and their observables like shadow radius and redshift. It compares these RBHs to Reissner-Nordström (RN) BHs, showing they are indistinguishable for low charge-to-mass ratios but diverge for higher ratios. Observational constraints from Sagittarius A* and M87* suggest limits on the charge-to-mass parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the astrophysical and astronomical implications of NED-sourced RBHs, particularly their distinguishability from RN BHs and constraints on their parameters using real BH observations.

Method: The authors analyze two h-family RBH solutions using general relativity coupled with NED. They model photon trajectories to compute shadow radius and redshift, then compare results with RN BH metrics. Observational data from Sagittarius A* and M87* are used to constrain charge-to-mass ratios.

Result: For low charge-to-mass ratios, h-family RBHs match RN BH properties closely. At higher ratios, deviations occur in shadow size and redshift. Analysis of Sgr A* and M87* data imposes upper bounds on permissible charge-to-mass values for these RBHs.

Conclusion: The study highlights that NED RBHs with moderate charge are observationally similar to RN BHs but distinct at higher charges. Observations of supermassive BHs can constrain NED models, suggesting future tests via precision measurements of BH shadows and redshift effects.

Abstract: Spacetimes arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) are a good laboratory
for studying both the nature of regular black holes (RBH) solutions and the
imprints of nonlinear electromagnetic fields within this context. Over the past
few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable
attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$
framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members
of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to
general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential
astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation
on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and
gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry
followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate
value, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all
members) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) BH. In its turn,
for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe
discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those
of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius
A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the
charge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs.

Abstract: We consider the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (sEGB) $4d$ gravitational model
with a scalar field $\varphi\left(u\right)$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms.
The model action contains a potential term $U\left(\varphi\right)$, a
Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f\left(\varphi\right)$ and a parameter
$\varepsilon = \pm 1$, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to the ordinary
scalar field, and $\varepsilon = -1$ to the phantom field. In this paper we
applied the sEGB reconstruction procedure from our previous work
\cite{Er_Ivash} to the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric, a solution potentially
describing a quasi-black hole without an event horizon. Within this framework,
we also derived analytical solutions based on scalar-tensor theory with minimal
coupling.
  Our results indicate that for this configuration, the potential $U$ vanishes
and the scalar field is phantom-like. Furthermore, an analysis of the Einstein
equations in the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric reveals that all energy conditions are
violated. The corresponding energy-momentum tensor suggests the presence of
exotic matter with negative pressure, as indicated by the negative value of
$T_u^u$. This could originate from a scalar field (such as the Higgs field or
another nonlinear field), or from phenomena like dark energy or quintessence.
  In addition, we considered the application of our reconstruction method in
the sEGB model in the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) metric. As noted in this
paper, the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric is a limiting case of the Janus metric (as $s
\to +\infty$). Furthermore, we obtained some exact solutions of scalar-tensor
theory with minimal coupling in the JNW metric.

### [44] [Conformal characterization of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21646)
*Marc Mars,Gabriel Sánchez-Pérez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the asymptotic properties of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric, demonstrating its conformal completion with a well-defined null infinity and linking its asymptotic behavior at null infinity and the homothetic horizon. It identifies conformally covariant conditions that characterize the ambient metric, particularly relaxing the exactness condition of the homothety one-form in even dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conformal geometric structure of the ambient metric and its asymptotic behavior, improving upon previous requirements like the exactness of the homothety one-form in even dimensions.

Method: Analyzing the asymptotic expansion of the ambient metric, proving the existence of a conformal completion, relating expansions at null infinity and homothetic horizon, and deriving conformally covariant conditions through properties of this extension.

Result: Identified conformally covariant conditions that fully characterize the ambient metric, showed the obstruction tensor emerges naturally at infinity in even dimensions, and relaxed the exactness condition of the homothety one-form.

Conclusion: The derived conditions offer a conformal characterization of the ambient metric, broadening its applicability by relaxing previous restrictions and revealing deeper connections between asymptotic geometry and conformal invariants.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic structure of the Fefferman-Graham
ambient metric. We prove that every straight ambient metric admits a conformal
completion with a well-defined null infinity, and that the asymptotic expansion
of the metric at infinity can be related to that at the homothetic horizon.
Furthermore, in even dimensions, we show that the Fefferman-Graham obstruction
tensor naturally arises in the geometry at infinity. By identifying the
fundamental properties that this particular conformal extension exhibits, and
analyzing their sufficiency, we arrive at the main result of the paper, namely
the identification of a set of conformally covariant conditions that completely
characterize the ambient metric from a conformal perspective. In particular,
our result relaxes the requirement of the homothety one-form being exact.

Abstract: In recent years, significant advances have been made in exoplanet and brown
dwarf observations. By using state-of-the-art models, astronomers can determine
properties of their atmospheres, such as temperatures, the presence of clouds,
or the chemical abundances of molecules and atoms. Accurate and up-to-date
opacities are crucial to avoid inconclusive or biased results, but it can be
challenging to compute opacity cross-sections from the line lists provided by
various online databases.
  We introduce pyROX, an easy-to-use Python package to calculate molecular and
atomic cross-sections. Since pyROX works on CPUs, it can compute a small line
list on a regular workstation, but it is also easily parallelised on a cluster
for larger line lists. In addition to line opacities, pyROX also supports
calculations of collision-induced absorption. Tutorials are provided in the
online documentation which explain the configuration parameters and different
functionalities of pyROX.

### [46] [EBOP MAVEN: A machine learning model to estimate the input parameters for analytic fitting of detached eclipsing binary light curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21465)
*Stephen Overall,John Southworth*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The authors developed a CNN-based machine learning model to predict parameters of detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) from their light curves, achieving mean errors of 8.6% for synthetic and 8.7% for real systems. These predictions were effective in initializing formal analysis with the JKTEBOP code, leading to plans for a new pipeline for future PLATO mission targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of characterizing the large number of dEB systems from survey missions like Kepler and TESS, thereby improving scalability of data processing and enabling efficient analysis of these systems.

Method: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on synthetic dEB light curves to predict stellar parameters such as fractional radii, orbital inclination, eccentricity, and brightness ratio. The model's predictions were used as input for the JKTEBOP code for further analysis.

Result: The model achieved a mean error of 14.1% on a test dataset of 20,000 synthetic systems, improving to 8.6% for a subset resembling real systems. With TESS data, the mean error was 8.7±0.7%, and 27 of 28 real systems achieved good fits using JKTEBOP with model-predicted inputs.

Conclusion: The model's success supports its integration into a new automated pipeline with JKTEBOP, aiming to produce a target catalog for the PLATO mission, enhancing the analysis of dEBs to support future observational efforts.

Abstract: Detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) are a key source of data on
fundamental stellar parameters. Within the light curve databases of survey
missions such as Kepler and TESS are a wealth of new systems awaiting
characterisation. We aim to improve the scalability of efforts to process these
data by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model
to assist in the automation of their analysis. From a phase-folded and binned
dEB light curve the model predicts system parameters relating to stellar
fractional radii, orbital inclination and eccentricity, and the stellar
brightness ratio, for use as input values in subsequent formal analysis with
the established JKTEBOP analytic code. We find the model able to predict these
parameters for a previously unseen test dataset of 20000 synthetic dEB systems
with a mean error of 14.1% when compared with the label values, improving to
8.6% against a subset representative of real systems. When tested with the TESS
light curves of a set of real well-characterised systems, the model's
predictions yield a mean error of $8.7\pm0.7\%$ when compared with label values
derived from existing published analyses. Subsequent fitting of the TESS light
curves with the JKTEBOP analytic code while using the model predictions as
input values finds 27 of the 28 systems achieving a good fit. On the strength
of these results, we plan to build a new characterisation pipeline based on the
machine learning model and JKTEBOP code with the intention of producing a
target catalogue of dEB systems for potential observation with the forthcoming
PLATO mission.

### [47] [LEO Satellite Track Correction for CSST Multi-Band Imaging Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21510)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This study evaluates methods to correct contamination from LEO satellites in CSST survey images using multi-band simulations, achieving over 50% reduction in affected sources in some bands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the increasing contamination of CSST observations by LEO satellite trails, improving on previous single-band analyses.

Method: Simulated LEOsat trails with varied brightness/orbital parameters combined with multi-band images mimicking CSST conditions. Applied trail reconstruction and subtraction techniques.

Result: Correction methods reduced affected sources by over 50% in NUV band (for 550km/1200km altitudes) and over 30% in i band. Effectiveness varies by band, altitude, and brightness model.

Conclusion: Multi-band correction approaches effectively mitigate LEOsat contamination, with optimal performance depending on orbital parameters and brightness modeling.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit satellite (LEOsat) mega-constellations are considered to be
an unavoidable source of contamination for survey observations to be carried
out by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) over the next decade. This
study reconstructs satellite trail profiles based on simulated parameters,
including brightness levels and orbital altitudes, in combination with
multi-band simulated images. Compared to our previous work, the simulated
images in this study more accurately replicate the realistic observational
conditions of CSST and extend beyond single-band analysis. Variations in LEOsat
trail brightness, source brightness, background noise, and source density
across different bands result in differing levels of accuracy in trail
reconstruction and subsequently affect the reliability of photometric
measurements. The reconstructed trail profiles are subsequently applied to
correct the contaminated regions. Simulation results reveal varying levels of
contamination effects across different bands following LEOsat trail correction,
including both reconstruction and subtraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of
the correction, we quantified the fraction of affected sources using two
metrics: (1) magnitude errors greater than 0.01 mag attributable to LEOsats,
and (2) LEOsat-induced noise exceeding 10% of other noise contributions.
Following trail repair, the analysis reveals a reduction of over 50% in the
fraction of affected sources in the NUV band for both 550 km and 1200 km
altitudes, assuming a maximum brightness of 7 in the V band. In the i band, the
reduction exceeds 30%. The degree of improvement varies across spectral bands,
and depends on both satellite altitude and the adopted brightness model.
