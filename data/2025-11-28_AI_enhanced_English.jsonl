Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $\u03c3$ allows for the coupling $N S \u03c3$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\\rm rh}>m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\\rightarrow S\u03c3$), and (ii) for $T_{\\rm EW}<T_{\\rm rh}\\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $\u03c3-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\\langle\u03c3\\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $\u03c3-h$ coupling is small, then $\u03c3$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($\u03c3\\rightarrow S\u03bd$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($\u0394{N}_{\\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $\u0394{N}_{\\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a framework in the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism where a Majorana fermion S with lepton parity becomes a dark matter candidate.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this work, we investigate relativistic tidal forces around a black hole sourced by a cloud of strings, described by the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution. We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \\to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies relativistic tidal forces around a black hole with a cloud of strings, showing that tidal effects and orbital parameters evolve differently compared to traditional Schwarzschild scenarios due to parameters of the string cloud.", "motivation": "To understand how a cloud of strings modifies relativistic tidal forces and geodesic motion around a black hole, extending beyond standard Schwarzschild solutions by examining the generalized Letelier-Alencar spacetime.", "method": "The authors analyze the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution by calculating the Kretschmann scalar to assess curvature divergence, studying photon and massive particle geodesics (including circular orbits and radial infall), computing tidal forces, and examining their behavior under varying parameters g_s and l_s.", "result": "Key findings include increased photon sphere and innermost stable orbit radii with g_s, decreased radii with l_s, parameter-dependent nonexistence of circular orbits, tidal force inversion in radial motion (often within the horizon), and modified tidal profiles/circular Keplerian frequencies influenced by the cloud of strings even at large distances without tidal component sign changes.", "conclusion": "The cloud of strings significantly alters black hole dynamics, affecting tidal forces and orbital characteristics, suggesting observable differences from standard black hole metrics and highlighting the importance of string cloud parameters in relativistic astrophysics."}}
