Abstract: Space weather is among the most powerful and least understood forces shaping
planetary atmospheres. In our Solar System, we observe its effects directly:
atmospheric escape, chemical disruption, and spectacular auroral displays. Yet
for exoplanets, we lack the tools and data to comprehensively assess the
impacts of space weather, especially invisible elements like stellar winds,
coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and variable interplanetary
magnetic fields. This problem lies at the intersection of four key fields:
heliophysics, planetary science, astrobiology, and astrophysics. In 2023--2025,
experts from these four fields convened at the W. M. Keck Institute for Space
Studies to explore pathways for advancing the study of exospace weather.
Organizing the subject into five core themes -- planets and their stellar
particle environments, stellar magnetism and space weather modeling,
quasi-steady stellar winds, transient events, and programmatic pathways -- our
team synthesized concepts from across relevant fields and identified a wide
array of opportunities for progress. This report is the product of that effort.
It assembles cross-disciplinary knowledge; highlights outstanding theoretical
challenges; explores promising innovations in observation, modeling,
methodology, and instrumentation; and makes recommendations for accelerating
community-wide progress. Together, these lay out a path to transforming the
challenging, yet tractable problem of exospace weather into a foundational
element of our understanding exoplanetary systems, and our own Solar System, in
their entirety.

Abstract: In December 2024, the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton X-ray
Observatory celebrated the 25th anniversary of its launch. The annual number of
peer-reviewed articles utilising XMM-Newton data has exhibited a consistent
upward trajectory over the past two and a half decades, attaining more than 400
in 2022. The annual call for observing time proposals continues to experience a
high level of oversubscription, typically ranging from a factor of 6 to 7. In
order to enhance the scientific discovery space, XMM-Newton, primarily through
the Project Scientist and Science Operations Centre, has pursued a strategy of
expansion, which can be grouped into three phases: Large Projects with long
observing time (2006-2009), Joint Observations (2011-2016), and Targets of
Opportunity (2016-2024), respectively. A salient feature of XMM-Newton's time
allocation is the systematic removal of biases from the second call onwards, a
strategy that has enabled the attainment of comparable gender success rates and
high acceptance rates for young scientists over 25 years, a feat only recently
accomplished by similar missions through the introduction of double-anonymous
review. XMM-Newton research is conducted by an active community of 4,300
scientists, of which approximately 570 are leading (1st author). The foundation
of this community and its research is predicated on XMM-Newton data, with the
project's policy of user support and calibration being fundamental
constituents, as well as the project's active engagement and communication with
its members.

Abstract: We present precise J- and K-band photometric measurements for 128
near-infrared secondary standard stars, located in the 19 UKIRT/MKO primary
faint standard fields. The data were collected over more than 50 nights,
covering a decade of observations between 2008 and 2018 at the ESO La Silla
Observatory, using the New Technology Telescope (NTT) equipped with the SOFI
NIR camera. Presented magnitudes are calibrated onto the MKO photometric
system. The J- and K-band magnitudes range from 10 to 15.8 mag, with median
values of $\tilde{J}$ = 13.5 and $\tilde{K}$ = 13 mag. The selection process
ensured high photometric quality, with a precision better than 0.01 mag for all
stars. The catalog excludes stars with close neighbors, high proper motion, or
variable stars. Using these fields for standardization can improve the
precision and accuracy of photometric calibrations without increasing the
observational time cost.

### [4] [Improving the Energy and Angular Resolutions of X-ray Telescopes with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02961)
*Ephraim Gau,Zhongyuan Liu,Henric Krawczynski,Chong Zu*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel focal-plane detector combining metallic magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs) with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for enhanced X-ray telescope resolution, offering superior angular and energy resolution compared to existing technologies without requiring cryogenic multiplexing electronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current X-ray telescopes in energy and angular resolution, as well as scalability issues posed by multiplexing electronics in existing systems like transition-edge sensors (TES) and MMC-SQUID setups.

Method: The detector integrates MMC arrays with paramagnetic absorber pads and NV centers in diamond for simultaneous optical readout. X-ray photons cause temperature-induced magnetic field changes in the absorbers, which are imaged optically by NV centers. The design uses a 10 µm absorber length and 12 m focal length.

Result: Achieves 0.17 arcsecond angular resolution and ~0.70 eV energy resolution. Eliminates need for cryogenic multiplexing, enabling scalable larger/finer arrays with better resolution and wider fields of view.

Conclusion: The NV-MMC design provides significant advantages over existing technologies, offering scalable, high-resolution X-ray detection with simplified electronics, suitable for advanced astronomical observations.

Abstract: We introduce a focal-plane detector for advancing the energy and angular
resolutions of current X-ray telescopes. The architecture integrates a metallic
magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) array of paramagnetic absorber pads with a thin
layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for simultaneous optical
readout. An impinging X-ray photon induces a temperature transient in an
absorber pad, kept at ~35 mK. This time- and temperature-dependent magnetic
field transient is then optically imaged by diamond NV centers, kept at 4 K and
positioned directly below the pad. For a 10 $\mu$m absorber length used with a
12 m focal length telescope, our design yields an optimal angular resolution of
~0.17 arcseconds and energy resolution of ~0.70 eV. Our NV-MMC design improves
upon current transition-edge sensors (TES) or MMCs read-out by superconducting
quantum interference devices (SQUID) by enabling simultaneous optical readout
of the entire MMC array. Because no additional cryogenic multiplexing
electronics are required, our approach scales naturally to larger and finer
arrays, supporting finer angular resolutions and wider fields of view.

Abstract: SPHEREx, a NASA explorer satellite launched on 11 March 2025, is carrying out
the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102
spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to
130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 -
19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after
mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will
produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain
the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce
two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping
to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of
infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will
comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other
biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly
released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release
specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed.
The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on
planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3
years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft,
which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial
evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.

### [6] [A new broadband atmospheric dispersion corrector for HROS-TMT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03225)
*Manjunath Bestha,Thirupathi Sivarani,Bachar Wehbe,Amirul Hasan,Bharat Chandra P,Devika K Divakar,Athira Unni,Parvathy Menon,Arun Surya,Pallavi Saraf*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Rotational Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (RADC) using Amici prisms and the Filippenko model in Zemax to correct broadband atmospheric dispersion for the High-Resolution Optical Spectrograph (HROS) on the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), improving fiber coupling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric dispersion causes elongated images and reduced fiber coupling efficiency in spectrograph observations. The RADC addresses broadband dispersion issues in the multi-object mode of HROS/TMT, particularly enhancing accuracy in blue wavelengths where this effect is more pronounced.

Method: The RADC uses Amici prisms optimized for ≥90% transmission and minimal beam deviation. The Filippenko (1982) model, customized via a DLL in Zemax, enables precise dispersion corrections. Simulations and optical design analysis validated performance across 0.31-1 micron wavelengths.

Result: The design achieves >90% transmission efficiency, minimal angular deviation post-correction, and improved accuracy in the blue spectrum region. Simulations confirm effective broadband dispersion correction for HROS/TMT multi-object operations.

Conclusion: The RADC provides an effective solution for atmospheric dispersion correction in TMT's HROS, ensuring high-fidelity spectroscopic data collection. The integration of Filippenko's model into Zemax sets a new standard for precision in optical design for large telescopes.

Abstract: Atmospheric dispersion causes light from celestial objects with different
wavelengths to refract at varying angles as it passes through Earth's
atmosphere. This effect results in an elongated image at the focal plane of a
telescope and diminishes fiber coupling efficiency into spectrographs. We
propose an optical design that incorporates a Rotational Atmospheric Dispersion
Corrector (RADC) to address the broadband dispersion encountered in the
multi-object mode of the High-Resolution Optical Spectrograph (HROS) on the
Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The RADC corrects the dispersion across the
entire wavelength range (0.31-1 micron), using Amici prisms optimized for over
90% transmission efficiency and minimal angular deviation of the beam from the
optical axis after dispersion correction. For enhanced accuracy, particularly
in the blue region, we have, for the first time, implemented the Filippenko
(1982) model in Zemax via a custom Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file.

Abstract: We present a fast data processing system for the Baikal-GVD neutrino
telescope, designed for rapid identification of astrophysical neutrino events.
Leveraging Baikal-GVD's modular cluster architecture, the system implements
parallelized file processing where raw data files undergo concurrent analysis
across dedicated virtual machines. The system implements two pipelines: a fast
per-file processing and a fully fledged (per-run) processing, which integrates
dynamic detector geometry determined from acoustic and inertial positioning
systems and data quality monitoring with a latency of about 27 hr. The fast
processing pipeline delivers a total latency of about 1.5-18 minutes from event
detection to reconstructed data availability, depending on water luminescence
levels. This enables fast follow-up observations of transient astrophysical
sources, fulfilling Baikal-GVD's role in multi-messenger networks. The article
also highlights key features of the data acquisition system, the integration of
advanced synchronization systems and a robust infrastructure for data handling
and storage, ensuring efficient and reliable operation of the Baikal-GVD
telescope.

*Axel Potier,Raphaël Galicher,Pierre Baudoz,Johan Mazoyer,Zahed Wahhaj,Ruben Tandon,Jonas G. Kühn,Laura Perez,Gael Chauvin*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: CDI method validates real science targets, effective for nearly face-on circumstellar disks challenging for ADI. Speckle modulation via phase offsets on VLT/SPHERE’s deformable mirror separates astrophysical scenes from speckles. Combining frames with KLIP recovers disks without ADI’s artifacts. CDI is efficient, less reliant on slewing, and reduces aberration effects for future surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of ADI (self-subtraction, inefficiency at small separations, transit dependency) caused by residual aberrations (especially non-common path) in AO systems. CDI aims to isolate coherent starlight residuals via speckle modulation.

Method: Temporal modulation of speckle fields using phase offsets on SPHERE’s DM during observation of 4 stars with circumstellar disks. KLIP framework combines data frames and reference PSFs to separate incoherent astrophysical scenes from speckles.

Result: Successfully recovered circumstellar disks (HR4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD169142, HD163296) without ADI artifacts like self-subtraction. Validated CDI's effectiveness on real targets.

Conclusion: CDI is a promising method for calibration of static/quasi-static aberrations in future surveys due to its efficiency, minimal slewing requirement, and reduced image artifacts.

Abstract: High-contrast imaging relies on advanced coronagraphs and adaptive optics
(AO) to attenuate the starlight. However, residual aberrations, especially
non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel,
limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as
spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those
issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular
separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously
demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI),
which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent
starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted
from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI
method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging
almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve
with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images,
applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars
surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD
163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle
field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames
and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Lo\`eve
image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the
artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms
(e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising
strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in
future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require
frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first
order.

Abstract: Galactic white-dwarf binaries play a central role in the inference model for
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In this manuscript, we employ the
$\texttt{bahamas}$ codebase to characterize, in a global-fit fashion, the
reconstruction of the Galactic foreground during the first year of observation.
To account for its statistical properties, we represent the data in
time--frequency domain, and characterize the effectiveness of multiple
approaches, e.g. statistically viable likelihoods, sampling schemes,
segmentation widths, and gaps density. Our analysis yields consistent results
across, with overwhelming evidence in favor of a non-stationary model in less
than a month of data. Moreover, we show robustness against the presence of
additional extragalactic foregrounds, and test the suitability of our
approximations on the more complex simulated data in the $\textit{Yorsh}$ data
challenge.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Complex inference tasks, such as those encountered in Pulsar Timing Array
(PTA) data analysis, rely on Bayesian frameworks. The high-dimensional
parameter space and the strong interdependencies among astrophysical, pulsar
noise, and nuisance parameters introduce significant challenges for efficient
learning and robust inference. These challenges are emblematic of broader
issues in decision science, where model over-parameterization and prior
sensitivity can compromise both computational tractability and the reliability
of the results. We address these issues in the framework of hierarchical
Bayesian modeling by introducing a reparameterization strategy. Our approach
employs Normalizing Flows (NFs) to decorrelate the parameters governing
hierarchical priors from those of astrophysical interest. The use of NF-based
mappings provides both the flexibility to realize the reparametrization and the
tractability to preserve proper probability densities. We further adopt
i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to accelerate exploration of complex
posteriors. This unified use of NFs improves statistical robustness and
computational efficiency, providing a principled methodology for addressing
hierarchical Bayesian inference in PTA analysis.

TL;DR: SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network, is introduced for analyzing low-resolution transient spectra, achieving high performance in classification and precise redshift prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral analysis methods like template fitting struggle with complex, evolving spectra of transients, especially at low resolution. Spectroscopic data is crucial but requires more effective analysis tools.

Method: SpectraNet uses multi-scale convolution kernels and pooling to hierarchically extract features from preprocessed spectra, enabling robust representation learning.

Result: State-of-the-art classification performance and a root mean squared relative redshift error of 0.02, demonstrating effectiveness in both classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: Deep learning approaches like SpectraNet offer significant improvements in analyzing transient spectra, enhancing our ability to classify sources and predict redshifts accurately.

Abstract: Time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have opened a
new frontier in the discovery and characterization of transients. While
photometric light curves provide broad temporal coverage, spectroscopic
observations remain crucial for physical interpretation and source
classification. However, existing spectral analysis methods -- often reliant on
template fitting or parametric models -- are limited in their ability to
capture the complex and evolving spectra characteristic of such sources, which
are sometimes only available at low resolution. In this work, we introduce
SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network designed to learn robust
representations of optical spectra from transients. Our model combines
multi-scale convolution kernels and multi-scale pooling to extract features
from preprocessed spectra in a hierarchical and interpretable manner. We train
and validate SpectraNet on low-resolution time-series spectra obtained from the
Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) and other instruments,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in classification. Furthermore, in
redshift prediction tasks, SpectraNet achieves a root mean squared relative
redshift error of 0.02, highlighting its effectiveness in precise regression
tasks as well.

TL;DR: The study investigates polarized features of current-driven kink instability in relativistic blazar jets using the new RaptorP GRRT code, linking observed QPOs to jet dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain observational signatures of blazars, particularly quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and polarized emissions, by analyzing the effects of CD kink instability post-recollimation shocks.

Method: Developed the 3D special relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (SRMHD) simulation module RaptorP, which models polarized radiation from relativistic jets. Analyzed jet images, EVPA patterns, and light curves across frequencies.

Result: At low frequencies, emission originates from turbulent ambient medium with poloidal fields; at high frequencies, twisted kink structures and toroidal fields dominate. QPOs in light curves correlate with kink rotation periods, showing anti-correlation between intensity and polarization at low inclination angles.

Conclusion: The findings provide a framework to interpret blazar observations, connecting observed QPOs and polarization variations to CD kink instability dynamics in relativistic jets.

Abstract: Recent polarimetric observations of blazars indicate the development of
current-driven (CD) kink instability after passing the recollimation shocks in
the relativistic jets and association with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).
To investigate multi-wavelength polarized features of CD kink instability in
jets, we develop {\tt RaptorP}, a new special relativistic module of the
polarized General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) code {\tt RAPTOR}.
Based on 3D SRMHD simulations of over-pressured magnetized jets, we find that
jet images vary at different frequencies. At low frequencies, the emission
comes from the turbulent ambient medium surrounding the jet that obscures the
inner jet structure. Electronic Vector Position Angle (EVPA) patterns are
perpendicular to the jet propagation direction, indicating a dominance of the
poloidal magnetic field. At high frequencies, bright knots and twisted kink
structures appear, and EVPA patterns are consistent with a toroidal magnetic
field. We also find that QPOs in light curves of intensity and linear
polarization (degree and angle). The peak frequency in Power Spectral Densities
(PSDs) is well-matched with the rotation period of the kink structure in
relativistic jets. It shows an anti-correlation between total intensity and the
degree of polarization at a lower inclination angle. Our findings, based on
realistic polarized radiation calculations, will explain the observational
signatures seen in blazars.

*Jingbo Wang,Jintao Xie,Jing Zou,Jianfei Tang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes four nulling pulsars using FAST, revealing new insights into their emission behaviors. Key findings include reclassification of a pulsar's mode from subpulse drifting to mode changing, identification of low-level emission in a seemingly null state, detection of additional features in another, and the coexistence of nulling and subpulse drifting without direct interaction. These findings highlight FAST's capability in capturing subtle pulsar emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the diverse manifestations of pulsar nulling and emission variability using FAST's high sensitivity, providing new data to understand the underlying mechanisms and relationships between emission states.

Method: Observational analysis of four nulling pulsars (PSR J1649+2533, J1752+2359, J1819+1305, J1916+1023) using the FAST telescope. Data was collected to study emission states, nulling behaviors, and interactions between nulling and subpulse drifting.

Result: Key results include reclassification of PSR J1649+2533's mode, discovery of persistent low-level emission in PSR J1752+2359's 'quasi-null' state, detection of weaker features in PSR J1819+1305, and confirmation of coexisting nulling and subpulse drifting in PSR J1916+1023 without direct interaction.

Conclusion: FAST's observations reveal previously unobserved subtle emission states in nulling pulsars, advancing understanding of pulsar emission mechanisms and variability. This underscores the importance of high-sensitivity telescopes in studying such phenomena and contributes to broader research on pulsar emission dynamics.

Abstract: We present an analysis of 4 nulling pulsars with the Five-hundred-meter
Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). For PSR J1649+2533, our results
suggest mode changing rather than subpulse drifting as previously reported at
lower frequencies. For PSR J1752+2359, we confirm its quasi-periodic switching
between distinct emission states, but further show that the so-called
"quasi-null" or "RRAT-like" state actually consists of persistent low-level
emission superposed with occasional bright pulses. For PSR J1819+1305, our data
confirm the modulation reported earlier, while additional weaker features are
also seen. For PSR J1916+1023, we detect both nulling and subpulse drifting,
but find no clear evidence of direct interaction between them. These results
provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of pulsar nulling,
highlight the capability of FAST to detect subtle emission states, and add to
the growing body of work on pulsar emission variability.

### [14] [Exploring the spectral characteristics of the periodic burster 4U 1323-62: Type-I X-ray burst and persistent emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03172)
*Mahasweta Bhattacharya,Aditya S. Mondal,Biplab Raychaudhuri,Gulab C. Dewangan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of NuSTAR observations of the X-ray bursts from 4U 1323-62 reveals persistent thermal Comptonization and absorption edges, with six Type-I bursts showing burst-disc interaction via Poynting-Robertson drag and neutron star radius estimates between 1.5-3.5 km.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the burst-disc interactions and neutron star properties using detailed spectral analysis of Type-I X-ray bursts from 4U 1323-62.

Method: NuSTAR data analysis with time-resolved spectroscopy, using models combining thermal emission and persistent components to measure burst parameters like ignition depths and apparent radii.

Result: Detected an absorption edge at 7.87 keV, burst recurrence time of ~4.52 hr, neutron star radii of 1.5-3.5 km, and evidence of burst-disc interaction via increased f_ck parameter during bursts.

Conclusion: The observed parameters suggest mixed H-He fuel ignition, Poynting-Robertson drag-induced burst-disc interaction, and the data provide constraints on neutron star structure and accretion disc dynamics.

Abstract: We report on the results obtained by the analysis of persistent and type-I
thermonuclear X-ray burst emission observed from the periodic burster 4U
1323-62. These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024
August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well
described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is
also detected at an energy of approximately 7.87 keV, which indicates the
presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have
been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence
time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of
a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy
of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from
the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study
the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission
during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which
reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst
intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of
bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron
star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst
parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed
hydrogen-helium fuel layer.

### [15] [Measuring scattering variations in pulsar timing observations: A test of the fidelity of current methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03185)
*A. D. Kulkarni,R. M. Shannon,D. J. Reardon,M. T. Miles*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the reliability of interstellar medium (IISM) noise models used in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), particularly with MeerKAT PTA data. Simulations reveal significant radio-frequency decorrelation in scattering variations and possible model-induced anticorrelations between DM and scattering. Plasma underdensities along specific pulsar sightlines are suggested, and current models may falsely indicate scattering frequency dependence. Improved modeling is critical for accurate IISM property measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the reliability of existing IISM noise models used in PTA collaborations, addressing concerns about potential model misspecification and the physical validity of recovered processes. This is crucial for enhancing the precision of gravitational wave measurements through PTA data analysis.

Method: The authors performed multi-frequency simulations of multipath propagation in the IISM, focusing on long refractive length scales (500 units), to analyze scattering variations. They analyzed MPTA 4.5-year data for DM and scattering correlations, compared simulation outcomes with observational data, and tested model performance through synthetic datasets.

Result: Simulations showed significant radio-frequency decorrelation in anisotropic scattering mediums. Observed DM-scattering anticorrelations were linked to model fitting methods. Plasma underdensities were identified near PSR J1431-5740 and PSR J1802-2124. Current models falsely attributed scattering frequency dependence to actual data, highlighting model limitations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that existing IISM noise models require improvements to accurately measure IISM properties and avoid misleading inferences. Enhanced modeling is necessary to ensure precise gravitational wave detection via PTAs, emphasizing the need for refined approaches to account for scattering dynamics and model biases.

Abstract: The turbulent nature of the ionised interstellar medium (IISM) causes
dispersion measure (DM) and scattering variations in pulsar timing
measurements. To improve precision of gravitational wave measurements, pulsar
timing array (PTA) collaborations have begun the use of sophisticated and
intricate noise modelling techniques such as modelling stochastic variations
induced by the turbulent IISM and quasi-deterministic processes attributed to
discrete structures. However, the reliability of these techniques has not been
studied in detail, and it is unclear whether the recovered processes are
physical or if they are impacted by misspecification. In this work, we present
an analysis to test the efficacy of IISM noise models based on the data from
the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) 4.5-year data release. We first
performed multi-frequency, long-length (500 refractive length scale)
simulations of multipath propagation in the IISM to study the properties of
scattering variations under a variety of scattering conditions. The results of
our simulations show the possibility of significant radio-frequency
decorrelation in the scattering variations, particularly for the anisotropic
scattering medium. Our analysis of the observed DM and scattering variations
using the MPTA 4.5-year data set shows that there can be apparent
anticorrelations between DM and scattering variations, which we attribute to
the model fitting methods. We also report a possibility that plasma
underdensities might exist along the sight lines of PSR J1431$-$5740 and PSR
J1802$-$2124. Finally, using simulations, we show that the IISM noise models
can result in the apparent measurement of strong frequency dependence of
scattering variations observed in the MPTA data set. Our analysis shows that
improvements in the IISM noise modelling techniques are necessary to accurately
measure the IISM properties.

### [16] [The First Upper Bound on the Non-Stationary Gravitational Wave Background and its Implication on the High Redshift Binary Black Hole Merger Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03262)
*Mohit Raj Sah,Suvodip Mukherjee*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Analyzes the high redshift merger rates and mass distributions of black hole binaries using spectral covariance of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data. Finds upper bounds on primordial black hole merger rates, constraining their formation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distinguish astrophysical vs primordial black holes by examining SGWB's spectral correlation properties. Previous power spectrum analyses had limitations under Gaussian assumptions; new sporadic/non-Gaussian SGWB characteristics require covariance analysis to better constrain merger rates and masses.

Method: First spectral covariance analysis of SGWB data from O3 and O4a runs. Measures spectral correlations to model high-z merger rates/mass distributions, calculating upper limits on PBH merger rates accounting for possible clustering effects.

Result: No SGWB detection, yielding upper bounds (2.4e4 to 2.3e2 Gpc⁻³yr⁻¹ at z=1) for PBH merger rates with median masses 20-120 M☉. These constraints apply even under spatial clustering scenarios.

Conclusion: Sets stringent limits on PBH merger rates at high redshift, challenging formation models. Future detections of this signal could confirm high-redshift black hole populations via gravitational waves.

Abstract: The high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of black hole binaries
(BHBs) is a direct probe to distinguish astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and
primordial black holes (PBHs), which can be studied using the Stochastic
Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The conventional analyses solely based on
the power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying
source population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution.
However, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian
in nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the
high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this
work, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data
from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of
the fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral
correlation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from
the current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the
range 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates
to the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between
$2.4\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\times10^{2} \rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\rm z} = 1 $
) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20
~M_{\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the
PBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH
formation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering. In the
future, detection of this signal will lead to direct evidence of the
high-redshift black hole population using gravitational waves.

*Yen-Jhen Liu,Yi Yang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates axion-like particles (ALPs) by analyzing X-ray spectra from three pulsars using NICER data. They applied a sliding-window power-law method to detect photon-ALP coupling-induced fluctuations, setting new upper limits on the coupling constant g_{aγγ} between 10^{-12} and 10^{-14} GeV^{-1}.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to constrain the axion-photon coupling constant g_{aγγ} by leveraging the unique environment of pulsars' strong magnetic fields, where ALPs and photons interact, leaving detectable imprints in X-ray spectra.

Method: The team used NICER X-ray data from three pulsars (PSR J2229+6114, PSR J1849-0001, PSR B0531+21). They employed a sliding-window power-law fitting technique to model each spectrum and identify deviations from the smooth continuum, which could indicate ALP-photon coupling effects.

Result: The analysis produced upper limits for g_{aγγ} in the range 10^{-12}-10^{-14} GeV^{-1}, refining the parameter space compared to prior studies by providing tighter constraints based on pulsar X-ray observations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using pulsar X-ray spectra and sliding-window analysis to probe ALP interactions. The derived constraints challenge theoretical models of ALPs and guide future particle physics and astrophysics research in dark matter and beyond-standard-model physics.

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can couple to photons in strong magnetic fields,
producing characteristic fluctuations in X-ray spectra. Using data from NASA's
Neutron Star Interior Composition EXplorer (NICER), we analyzed three pulsars,
PSR J2229+6114, PSR J1849-0001, and PSR B0531+21, to search for such features.
Each spectrum was modeled with a sliding-window power-law fitting method to
identify local deviations from the smooth continuum. From these analyses, we
derived constraints on the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$
within a refined parameter space compared to previous studies, obtaining upper
limits in the range $10^{-12}-10^{-14}GeV^{-1}$.

Abstract: We present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of inviscid
circumbinary discs (CBDs) around near equal-mass binary black holes (BBH) in
the binary-disc post-decoupling epoch. We use an approximate BBH spacetime with
a post-Newtonian inspiral motion trajectory from ${\sim}80 (M/10^7
\mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{days}$ (separation of ${\sim}\,30$ gravitational
radii) to ${\sim}100 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{minutes}$ before
merger. Initial data for the inspiral runs are produced from circular-orbits
runs covering the formation timescale of the overdense {\lq}lump{\rq}, orbiting
the CBD inner edge. The CBD non-axisymmetries (spiral waves and lump) lead to
non-negligible angular momentum transport with effective viscosity
${\alpha_\mathrm{eff} \, {\sim} \, 10^{{-3}}{- 2\times 10}^{-2}}$. We
post-process these simulations with a general-relativistic ray-tracing code to
obtain synthetic observations in thermal emission. We find the lump and its
associated electromagnetic (EM) modulation, already reported in the
pre-decoupling epoch, to survive post-decoupling up until the end of the
simulation. For LISA sources, our findings point to an active EM signature in
UV during optimal gravitational wave source localization. For PTA sources and
current BBH candidates detected through their optical periodicity: the lump{ in
a low-viscosity CBD is a possible, though not unique, origin} for the observed
periodicity.

Abstract: We study the transient black hole binary MAXI J1631--479 in its soft spectral
state observed simultaneously by the NICER and NuSTAR instruments. Its puzzling
feature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum
consists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The
irradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too
weak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past.
One invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk
irradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the
strong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the
spectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic
electrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\lesssim$10 keV reflects
that of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than
that of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line.
While this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk
intrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When
using a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted
spin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow
binary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and
radiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\approx0.8$--0.9, which underlines the
strong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements.

Abstract: Stellar models are calculated in the approximation of a uniform density

a stability loss, for stellar masses in the range from 2 up to $10^5$

The equation of state in the temperature and density ranges $10^9 < T < 10^{10}

Imshennik and Nadyozhin (1965). The critical parameters for the values of
entropy and stellar masses differ from more accurate values, obtained using a
more complicated variant of accepted density distribution, not more than

Abstract: Whether the accretion disc in the X-ray high-mode of transitional millisecond
pulsars (tMSP) reaches near the neutron star surface by penetrating the
magnetosphere is a crucial question with many implications, including for
continuous gravitational wave emission from the pulsar. We attempt to answer
this question for the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 by segregating high-mode data and
performing detailed spectral analysis using the XMM-Newton EPIC-PN+MOS1+MOS2
joint observations, XMM-Newton+NuSTAR joint observations, NICER and Chandra
individual observations during different epochs. With the sum of longest
exposures ($\sim$202 ksec of high mode data from $\sim$364 ksec of total
exposure), we performed a self-consistent spectral analysis and constrain the
inner disc radius 16.8 $\pm$ 3.8 km with at least 3$\sigma$ significance. Such
a measurement is found consistent with best-fit spectral values of inner disc
radius from other observatory like NICER and a joint observations with
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR within 3$\sigma$ limits. We also detect a Fe emission
line at 6.45 keV, for the first time from a tMSP, in the Chandra spectrum with
99% significance with an upper limit of the inner disc radius of 21 R$_g$,
supporting independently the fact that inner disc extends into neutron stars's
magnetosphere during high mode. All results from our analysis imply that the
accretion disc is significantly present and extended within the corotation
radius of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038 during the X-ray high-mode of the
tMSP PSR J1023+0038. The measured range of inner disc radius is fully
consistent with an independent analysis by Bhattacharyya (2020), which suggests
continuous gravitational wave emission from this neutron star, and the standard
model of X-ray pulsations in accreting MSPs.

Abstract: In 2024, a failed supernova candidate, M31-2014-DS1, was reported in the
Andromeda galaxy (M31), located at a distance of approximately 770 kpc. In this
paper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from
Super-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation
inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for
neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated
analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by
conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of
candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search
region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino
luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN
models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV
threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently
sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper
limit of 1.76 \times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity,
slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \times 10^{53} erg.

*Julia Ahlvind,Josefin Larsson,Dennis Alp*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes late-time X-ray emission from 242 core-collapse supernovae using multi-telescope observations and 3D simulations. Detects X-rays in 12 SNe, including four new cases, attributes most emissions to CSM interaction, but suggests a pulsar wind nebula in SN 1979C. Population synthesis constrains pulsar properties, favoring those with initial spins ≥100 ms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the population properties of compact objects (like neutron stars/pulsars) formed in core-collapse SNe by analyzing observable X-ray signals after ejecta become transparent. Existing uncertainties in pulsar formation and their impact on SN dynamics/compact object populations drive this study.

Method: 1. Analyzed 607 X-ray observations (Chandra/XMM/Swift/NuSTAR) of 242 SNe. 2. Applied 3D neutrino-driven explosion simulations to model ejecta absorption. 3. Detected 12 SNe with X-ray emission (4 new discoveries). 4. Fitted X-ray spectra to CSM interaction models, noting SN1979C's potential pulsar component. 5. Used upper limits to perform population synthesis constraining pulsar prevalence and properties.

Result: Detected X-ray emission from 12 SNe (4 new). Most spectra match CSM interaction, but SN1979C shows hard component indicative of pulsar wind nebula. Population analysis suggests pulsars with mean spin periods ≥100 ms are more likely. Some SNe imply CSM dense-shell interactions via high luminosities.

Conclusion: Late-time X-ray observations effectively probe compact object populations in SNe. The data supports pulsar formation in a subset of SNe with slower spins (~100ms), and highlights CSM interaction significance. Further observations needed to clarify pulsar frequency and evolutionary paths.

Abstract: The properties of the population of compact objects created in core-collapse
supernovae (SNe) are uncertain. X-ray observations years to decades after the
explosions offer a way to gain insight into this, as hard X-ray emission from
the central regions will emerge as the ejecta absorption decreases. Here we
analyze and place upper limits on late-time X-ray emission in 242 nearby SNe,
using 607 observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR. We use
absorption models based on 3D simulations of neutrino-driven explosions to
account for absorption of emission from the compact objects by the asymmetric
ejecta. We detect X-ray emission from 12 SNe, including four for the first time
(SN 1982R, SN 1984J, SN 1992bu, and SN 2003gk), and several of the others at
later epochs than before. The X-ray spectra of these SNe are consistent with
interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), with the possible exception of
SN 1979C, which shows an additional hard component, as also noted in previous
studies at earlier epochs. This emission may be due to a pulsar wind nebula.
Using the upper limits in the full sample, we also perform a population
synthesis to constrain the fraction of SNe that produce pulsars and the
properties of the pulsars themselves. We find that pulsar populations with mean
initial spin periods $\gtrsim100\rm~ ms$ are favored. Finally, we note that the
high luminosities of several of the SNe with CSM interaction imply interactions
with dense shells.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model where a two-slab system (dissipative warm corona over an accretion disk) explains the broad X-ray spectral features in AGN. Using photoionization and ray-tracing codes, it shows that highly ionized iron lines from the corona, influenced by SMBH spin and relativistic effects, dominate observed profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the origin of broad X-ray features in AGN spectra traditionally attributed to fluorescent disk emission, and to explore the role of warm coronae and relativistic effects in shaping line profiles.

Method: Combines TITAN (photoionization calculations for ion populations and line profiles) and GYOTO (relativistic ray-tracing) to model the two-slab system under varying parameters (SMBH spin, viewing angle, lamp height, dissipation).

Result: Highly ionized FeXXV/FeXXVI lines dominate observed profiles due to corona heating/dissipation and relativistic redshift. Line profiles depend strongly on SMBH spin and geometry, offering a new method to probe corona properties via high-res spectroscopy.

Conclusion: The model suggests that warm coronae contribute significantly to observed AGN X-ray lines, challenging previous interpretations attributing features solely to disk fluorescence. This provides a framework to infer corona structure and SMBH properties using relativistic spectral signatures.

Abstract: We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be
explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a
dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an
accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located
above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and
FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona,
can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity
of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying
the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor.
Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using
high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code
TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the
ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray
spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the
disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation
and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized
iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the
black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV.
For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron
lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the
illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona
covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under
strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those
originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total
line profile in AGN.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS)
matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\phi = P/\varepsilon$
or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\Delta = 1/3 - \phi$, which
quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$,
remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density
profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter.
Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter
accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the
intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that
$\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any
specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in
the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively
rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at
similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent
relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the
EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or
equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.

### [26] [Oscillatons in Scalar-Field Dark Matter from a Full Fourier Expansion of an Exponential Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02878)
*A. Mahmoodzadeh,K Ghaderi,P. Amiri*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores self-gravitating scalar field configurations called oscillatons as candidates for scalar-field dark matter (SFDM). It develops a unified Fourier-based framework to analyze oscillatons with exponential self-interaction, deriving radial profiles numerically. The study examines how coupling strength and central amplitude affect observables like energy density and pressure, confirming consistency with energy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate oscillatons as viable dark matter candidates by unifying previous treatments of scalar field interactions under a single framework, enabling detailed analysis of their properties and observables.

Method: The authors use a full Fourier (Jacobi-Anger) expansion to handle time dependence in the metric and potential, formulating a dimensionless boundary-value problem solved via Bessel-series truncation. They compute time-dependent observables and assess energy conditions.

Result: Derived observables exhibit dependence on coupling λ and central amplitude, with geometry showing only even harmonics. Radial flux oscillates at 2ω, and energy conditions are satisfied despite apparent negative pressures.

Conclusion: The method provides a reproducible framework for future stability and observational studies of SFDM oscillatons, advancing the understanding of their viability as dark matter candidates.

Abstract: Real, time-dependent scalar fields can form oscillating, self-gravitating
configurations-oscillatonsthat are viable candidates for scalar-field dark
matter (SFDM). We revisit oscillatons with an exponential self-interaction and
develop a full Fourier (Jacobi{Anger) treatment that resums the time dependence
of both the metric and the potential, thereby unifying quadratic, quartic, and
higher-order interactions within a single framework. After fixing the
small-amplitude normalization V0 = m2 {\Phi}=({\lambda}2k0), we derive a
closed, dimensionless boundary-value problem for the radial profiles and solve
it numerically via Bessel-series truncation with controlled convergence. We
compute time-resolved and time-averaged observables energy density, radial
energy flux, radial/tangential pressures, and total mass and map their
dependence on the coupling {\lambda} and central amplitude. The geometry
exhibits only even harmonics of the fundamental frequency, while composite
observables inherit a DC part plus even harmonics; the radial flux oscillates
predominantly at 2!. Apparent negative instantaneous pressures arise from
coherent oscillations and are assessed consistently through classical
energy-condition diagnostics (WEC/NEC/SEC). Our formulation provides a
reproducible and extensible baseline for stability analyses and observational
constraints on SFDM oscillatons

*Francesco Del Porro,Jacopo Mazza*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores thermodynamics of rotating black holes in theories beyond general relativity by analyzing three types of surface gravity on non-Killing horizons, deriving a Smarr formula, and computing Hawking radiation spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole mechanics in non-circular spacetimes where standard Killing horizons don't apply, particularly for models beyond general relativity.

Method: Defined and computed inaffinity, normal, and peeling surface gravities; derived Smarr's formula using horizon-averaged normal surface gravity; applied tunnelling method for Hawking radiation calculation.

Result: Inaffinity and normal surface gravities differ generically, but normal and peeling always agree though none are constant. Smarr formula uses averaged normal gravity. Hawking temperature tied to non-constant peeling gravity. Four laws' validity assessed in non-Killing horizons.

Conclusion:  Framework advances thermodynamic studies for black holes in non-general relativistic theories by resolving surface gravity discrepancies and extending key formulas to non-Killing scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanics of stationary axisymmetric non-Killing horizons,
which emerge in spacetimes that do not enjoy the symmetry known as circularity
-- as is commonly the case for rotating black holes beyond general relativity.
Specifically, we define and compute three notions of surface gravity:
inaffinity, normal, and peeling; and find that the inaffinity and normal
definitions generically differ, while the normal and peeling definitions always
agree, although none of them is constant over the horizon. We then derive a
version of Smarr's formula, which appears to involve an average over the
horizon of the normal surface gravity. We also compute, via the tunnelling
method, the spectrum of Hawking's radiation, verifying that its temperature is
controlled by the (non-constant) peeling surface gravity. Finally, we
recapitulate the status of the four laws of black hole mechanics in situations
in which the event horizon fails to be Killing. Our results thus pave the way
to a deeper understanding of black hole thermodynamics beyond general
relativity.

*Francesco Crescimbeni,Gregorio Carullo,Emanuele Berti,Giada Caneva Santoro,Mark Ho-Yeuk Cheung,Paolo Pani*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study evaluates the accuracy of ringdown models in gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers, finding that while the best models have mismatches as low as 1e-6 to 1e-4 for dominant harmonics, higher-order modes have larger mismatches up to 1e-2, highlighting the need for better models to meet future detector standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if traditional ringdown models, which are accurate in the late-time stationary regime, can reliably extend to earlier signal phases and improve recoverable signal portions.

Method: A time-domain analysis comparing non-precessing quasi-circular ringdown models (parameterized by binary properties) against numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, measuring mismatch values.

Result: Best models show mismatches of 1e-6–1e-4 for (2,2) harmonics and 1e-4–1e-2 for higher-order modes, indicating acceptable accuracy but insufficient for future detector sensitivities.

Conclusion: Current ringdown models are useful but inadequate for capturing early signal phases and higher-order modes. Improved modeling is critical for enhancing observational searches and meeting next-generation detector requirements.

Abstract: The ''ringdown'' stage of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole
mergers, mainly consisting of a superposition of quasinormal modes emitted by
the merger remnant, is a key tool to test fundamental physics and to probe
black hole dynamics. However, ringdown models are known to be accurate only in
the late-time, stationary regime. A key open problem in the field is to
understand if these models are robust when extrapolated to earlier times, and
if they can faithfully recover a larger portion of the signal. We address this
question through a systematic time-domain calculation of the mismatch between
non-precessing, quasi-circular ringdown models parameterised by the progenitor
binary's degrees of freedom and full numerical relativity
inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)
simulation catalog. For the best-performing models, the mismatch is typically
in the range $[10^{-6}, 10^{-4}]$ for the $(\ell,|m|)= (2,2)$ harmonic, and
$[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$ for higher-order modes. Our findings inform ongoing
observational searches for quasinormal modes, and underscore the need for
improved modeling of higher-order modes to meet the sensitivity requirements of
future gravitational-wave detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore singularity-free black holes in galactic environments by leveraging dark matter halo properties and resolving curvature singularities through specific pressure-density relations.

Method: Adopting $P_r = -\rho$ relation to ensure regular geometry, constructing solutions with Einasto/Dehnen halo profiles, analyzing axial stability, and calculating shadow radii/Lyapunov exponents.

Result: Asymptotically flat regular black hole solutions are achieved with suitable dark matter halos; they are stable under axial perturbations, with quantified shadow sizes and photon orbit instability metrics.

Conclusion: Dark matter halos can host stable regular black holes without curvature singularities, offering new astrophysical insights into black hole structure and observables like shadow measurements.

Abstract: We construct exact black-hole solutions free of curvature singularities,
sourced by dark matter halos described by galactic density profiles. Regularity
of the geometry is ensured by adopting the relation $P_{r}=-\rho$ between
radial pressure and density, which is consistent with the phenomenological
freedom of halo models. In particular, the sufficiently dense Einasto and
Dehnen-type profiles for the dark matter halo can produce asymptotically flat
solutions of singularity-free black holes embedded in the galactic environment.
The resulting regular black holes surrounded by dark matter are shown to be
stable under axial perturbations. We further compute the shadow radii and
Lyapunov exponents associated with the photon circular orbits around these
black holes.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper extends previous analytical formulas for light paths near compact objects to a wider range of spacetimes, including Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko metrics. This allows for accurate computation of images, polarization, and luminosity curves with simpler calculations compared to numerical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the applicability of existing analytical formulas beyond Schwarzschild spacetime, enabling more versatile study of phenomena like accretion disk imaging and polarization analysis in diverse spacetime geometries.

Method: Generalization of previous analytical methods to spherically symmetric, static spacetimes other than Schwarzschild. Derived mapping between emission points and observer's image plane using metric families like Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko. Calculated isoradial curves and Stokes parameters Q/U for a hot spot orbiting a black hole.

Result: Successfully created accurate, simplified formulas applicable across multiple spacetime models. Demonstrated with examples showing isoradial curves and polarization QU curves for hot spots, proving computational efficiency and versatility.

Conclusion: The extended formulas provide a valuable tool for astrophysical studies, offering a balance between computational speed and accuracy for analyzing general relativistic effects in varied spacetime geometries.

Abstract: In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas
(Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or
emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically
symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and
Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families. The generalized formulas retain the
simplicity and accuracy of the original approach while allowing for more
general deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. These expressions provide an
approximate yet accurate mapping between emission points and the image plane of
an asymptotic observer, enabling fast analytical computations of accretion disk
images, polarization of the emitted radiation, luminosity curves associated
with pulsars, and other related applications. As examples, we compute isoradial
curves for several metric families and the Stokes parameters Q and U for a hot
spot orbiting near a black hole described by one of the studied metrics,
presenting the corresponding polarization (QU) curves.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines static spherical vacuum solutions in bumblebee gravity models with various vacuum expectation values for B_mu. It classifies solutions, identifies degenerate cases leading to arbitrary functions when ξ=κ/2, and shows non-zero matter distributions can produce exact Schwarzschild solutions differing from general relativity, implications for solar system constraints discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify static spherical vacuum solutions in bumblebee gravity and investigate implications for the model’s consistency and experimental validity.

Method: Analysis of bumblebee gravity equations with B_mu's two-component space-like, light-like, and time-like vacuum expectation values, considering general parameter combinations.

Result: Degeneracy occurs when ξ=κ/2 allowing arbitrary functions, indicating model instability; exact Schwarzschild solutions exist with non-zero matter, contradicting general relativity predictions.

Conclusion: Bumblebee gravity’s lack of solar system constraint agreement and model instability under certain parameters challenge its viability, suggesting need for observational tests.

Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the
bumblebee field $B_\mu$ has a two-component space-like, light-like, and
time-like vacuum expectation value $b_\mu$ is studied. Based on the results, we
present a comprehensive classification of the static spherical vacuum solutions
in bumblebee gravity with general vacuum expectation values. We find that the
model becomes degenerate for a specific set of parameter combinations, where
the solution can be characterized by an arbitrary function, which indicates
that the non-minimally coupled massless vector tensor theory is ill-defined
when $\xi=\kappa/2$. We also find that contrary to the situation in general
relativity, the bumblebee gravity admits the exact Schwarzschild solution with
non-zero matter distributions of certain forms. The implications of this result
are discussed, suggesting that the experimental constraints within the solar
system would be invalid.

Abstract: This study combines theoretical advancements with observational limitations
to investigate the cosmological implications of a bulk viscous modified
Chaplygin gas (MCG) in a Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) in (3+1)
dimensional spacetime framework. We provide analytical solutions for both
viscous and non-viscous cases, pointing out variations in the energy density

transitions. Bulk viscosity suppresses oscillations in structure creation, a
well-known drawback of Chaplygin gas models in larger dimensions, as shown by a
thorough perturbation analysis. Using the bulk viscosity coefficient and Hubble
expansion parameter, which are incorporated by the total pressure and the
appropriate pressure and by using energy momentum conservation law determined
time time-dependent density. With the help of three conditions ($\xi = 0$,
$\xi\neq0$, and we neglect both bulk viscosity and presence of Chaplygin gas,
i.e $A=0$ and $\xi=0$) created three different models as the Hubble parameter
is a function of redshift $z$. By applying the MCMC method to these models, we
have gone through observational analysis by using the Hubble and BAO datasets.

Abstract: We give a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic and thermodynamic stability
of neutron stars composed of superconducting-superfluid mixtures within the
Iyer-Wald formalism. We derive the first law of thermodynamics and the
necessary and sufficient condition under which dynamic equilibrium implies
thermodynamic equilibrium. By constructing the phase space and canonical
energy, we show that the dynamic stability for perturbations, restricted in
symplectic complement of trivial perturbations with the ADM 3-momentum
unchanged, is equivalent to the non-negativity of the canonical energy.
Furthermore, dynamic stability against restricted axisymmetric perturbations
guarantees the dynamic stability against all axisymmetric perturbations. We
also prove that the positivity of canonical energy on all axisymmetric
perturbations within the Lagrangian displacement framework with fixed angular
momentum is necessary for thermodynamic stability. In particular, the
equivalence of dynamic and thermodynamic stability for spherically symmetric
perturbations of static, spherically symmetric isentropic configurations is
established.

Abstract: We study wormhole geometries embedded in an expanding universe within a
four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model, where the target-space metric is
identified with the spacetime Ricci tensor. In this framework, wormholes can
remain stable even when conventional energy conditions are violated. However,
once cosmological expansion is included, the effective energy density and
pressure are modified by the cosmological fluid, enabling the energy conditions
to be satisfied. We further present intriguing geometries in which a finite
future singularity appears in our universe but not in another universe
connected by the wormhole. Near the throat, the hypersurface becomes timelike,
allowing trajectories to traverse to the other universe before the singularity
and return afterwards. We also construct wormhole solutions motivated by
galactic dark-matter halo profiles, where the required non-vanishing pressure
arises naturally from the four-scalar non-linear $\sigma$ model.

Abstract: The exact measurement of neutrino mass remains a longstanding issue. So far,
there has been much success in providing an upper bound for the neutrino rest
mass, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, by exploring the
critical radius of a beam of polarized quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle
deflecting around a classical Kerr black hole, we attempt to provide an
additional testing ground for neutrino mass, as well as the mass of other
proposed ultra-light particles yet to be determined. Notably, the quantum Dirac
equation is used to derive a MPD-like equation satisfied by the polarized beam
of massive spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles and identify the effective spin in the
spin tensor with the particle's intrinsic quantum spin, confirming the previous
theoretical result that the MPD equation can be in fact applied to particles'
intrinsic spin. The result of this work shows that corrections of relative
magnitude $>10^{-12}$ can be achieved for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with
rest mass equal to $1 eV/c^2$ deflecting around a solar mass Kerr black hole.
Although highly theoretical, a new method of extracting the lower bound for the
neutrino mass individually is also proposed due to the behavior of the quantum
spin correction.

that such corrections arise systematically from the extended structure of the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ghostly instabilities in vector and axial sectors of MAG and explore phenomenological signatures from dynamical torsion/nonmetricity through gravitational wave observations.

Method: Derived pp-wave solutions by applying Type N algebraic classification conditions to field strength tensors in a cubic MAG model, solving the resulting field equations.

Result: Obtained gravitational wave solutions with a metric function incorporating torsion/nonmetricity contributions, predicting an additional scalar polarisation mode in the gravitational wave spectrum.

Conclusion: The scalar polarisation provides a testable signature for MAG theories, distinguishing them from General Relativity, and highlights the role of metric-affine geometries in modifying gravitational wave phenomenology.

Abstract: We derive new exact gravitational wave solutions with dynamical torsion and
nonmetricity tensors in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG). For
this purpose, we consider the full algebraic classification of the
gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries and impose a set of
Type N conditions on the field strength tensors that implement the kinetics of
torsion and nonmetricity in a particular cubic MAG model, recently considered
to eliminate ghostly instabilities from the vector and axial sectors of the
theory. The new solutions represent pp-waves characterised by a metric function
that includes the dynamical contributions of the torsion and nonmetricity
tensors provided by the field equations of the model. In particular, these
quantities induce a scalar polarisation mode in the gravitational-wave
spectrum, thus offering a distinctive phenomenological signature beyond the
ordinary tensor polarisation modes of General Relativity.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how a Schwarzschild-like black hole within a Dehnen dark matter halo affects the motion of a particle, finding that the halo's properties can induce chaos in the particle's trajectory without violating surface gravity bounds, with implications for gravitational wave studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of dark matter halos on the dynamics of particles orbiting black holes, particularly the conditions leading to chaos and its observational consequences in extreme-mass-ratio inspiral systems.

Method: Using Hamiltonian analysis, the authors derived conditions for unstable orbits and homoclinic trajectories, analyzed phase-space structures via Poincaré sections and Lyapunov exponents, and studied effects of halo density and scale radius.

Result: Increasing halo density and scale radius amplifies nonlinear effects, leading to chaotic motion. The chaotic dynamics emerge without violating the surface gravity bound, altering particle motion stability in realistic astrophysical settings.

Conclusion: Dark matter halos significantly influence black hole particle dynamics, introducing chaos that could留下印记在 extreme-mass-ratio inspiral gravitational wave signals. This study advances understanding of astrophysical systems with dark matter involvement.

Abstract: We study the existence of homoclinic orbit and the onset of chaotic motion
for a massive particle moving around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded
in a Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) type dark matter halo, within the extreme-mass-ratio
limit q = m/M << 1, where m and M are the masses of the particle and the
central black hole, respectively. The presence of the halo modifies the
spacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing
the particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the
conditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic
trajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By
analyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure,
we identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon
region. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents
calculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along
with energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We
demonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability
of particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal
surface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of
horizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a
theoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave
signals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system.

TL;DR: The study examines how dark matter (DM) interactions with baryons (protons and electrons) affect high-redshift galaxy formation, using JWST UVLF data to derive strict upper limits on DM-baryon scattering cross-sections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, which cannot be fully accounted for by standard models. DM-baryon interactions may suppress small-scale structure formation, impacting UVLF measurements.

Method: Employed a galaxy formation model tailored for high-redshift observations to simulate effects of DM-proton and DM-electron scattering with various velocity dependences (v⁻², v⁰, v⁻⁴). Compared simulated UVLFs with JWST data to constrain cross-sections.

Result: Set strongest upper limits for DM-proton scattering (v⁻² dependence) at DM masses 1-500 MeV. For other interactions, results are competitive with existing cosmological constraints. Demonstrates JWST's potential as a probe of DM interactions.

Conclusion: JWST observations provide a unique avenue to test non-gravitational DM physics. Constraints from UVLFs complement other cosmological probes and open new parameter space in dark matter models.

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered numerous bright galaxies
at high redshifts ($z\approx$ 10 -- 14). Many astrophysical models and beyond
the Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these
observations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark
matter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the
JWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress
structure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on
the UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model
designed to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits
on DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter
space. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section $\propto v^{-2}$ velocity
dependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of $\sim$ 1 -- 500 MeV.
For other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section $\propto
v^{0},\,v^{-4}$, and DM-electron scattering cross-section $\propto
v^{0},\,v^{-2},\,v^{-4}$), our limits are competitive with those obtained from
other cosmological observables. Our study highlights the potential of JWST
observations as a novel and powerful probe of non-gravitational interactions of
DM.

further scrutinise this possibility, a precise theoretical understanding of the
dynamics of the phase transition is required. Here we perform such an analysis
for a dark sector with an Abelian Higgs model in the conformal limit, which is
known to admit large supercooling. We compare simple analytic parametrisations
of the bounce action, one-loop finite temperature calculations including Daisy
resummation, and results of a dimensionally reduced (3D) effective theory
including up to two-loop corrections using the DRalgo framework. Consistent
renormalisation group evolution (RGE) of the couplings is essential for a
meaningful interpretation of the results. We find that the 3D EFT with
consistent expansion in the 4D parameters gives a significantly reduced scale
dependence of the phase transition parameters. With a suitable choice of RGE
scale, the 4D high temperature expanded effective potential yields results
consistent with the 3D calculations, while the analytic parametrisation
deviates significantly in the limit of large supercooling.

### [41] [Semi-visible emerging jets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02918)
*Juliana Carrasco,Suchita Kulkarni,Wei Liu,Joshua Lockyer,Jose Zurita*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes semi-visible emerging jets (SVEJ) as a new dark-shower signature in extended Standard Models with Hidden Valleys. It focuses on dark pions as long-lived particles with tunable lifetimes, optimizing an analysis for ~10 mm lifetimes and demonstrating improved sensitivity using ATLAS triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden Valleys or dark sectors coupled via s-channel mediators offer a viable framework for new physics, necessitating novel signatures to detect long-lived particles (LLPs). Traditional LLP searches miss cases like ~10 mm lifetimes, requiring optimized strategies.

Method: Develops SVEJ signatures interpolating between semi-visible and emerging jets. Uses ATLAS emerging-jet triggers, analyzes dark pion decays with variable lifetimes, and reinterprets existing searches targeting longer lifetimes.

Result: Demonstrates SVEJ detection sensitivity of ~0.1 fb for 10 mm lifetimes. Highlights gaps in current analyses for intermediate lifetimes and calls for further study of hadronization and detector effects.

Conclusion: Advocates for SVEJ-based searches as a critical tool for Hidden Valley models. Stresses the need for more comprehensive studies addressing theoretical and experimental uncertainties to fully explore this signature's potential.

Abstract: We propose a new class of dark-shower signatures in Standard Model extensions
featuring Hidden Valleys or dark sectors coupled through an s-channel mediator.
In this framework, unstable dark pions appear as long-lived particles (LLPs),
with their lifetimes treated as free parameters. The resulting signatures,
which we term semi-visible emerging jets (SVEJ), continuously interpolate
between the established semi-visible and emerging jet regimes. We outline an
analysis strategy optimized for dark pion lifetimes of order $\mathcal{O}(10)$
mm, and reinterpret existing LLP searches targeting lifetimes of
$\mathcal{O}(100)$-$\mathcal{O}(1000)$ mm. Our proposed SVEJ search, exploiting
the current ATLAS emerging-jet trigger, achieves sensitivity to cross sections
of $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ fb for lifetimes around $\mathcal{O}(10)$ mm. Finally, we
advocate a more detailed study, including hadronization uncertainties and
detector-level effects.

### [42] [A Consistent Path Integral Approach to Higher Derivative Oscillators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03013)
*Jose A. R. Cembranos,Eric G. Hemon,Juan J. Sanz-Cillero*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) version of the higher derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, focusing on canonical quantization, Fock space construction, and path integral analysis. It introduces a Lagrange multiplier field to ensure consistency in canonical quantization and examines improved ultraviolet convergence of Green functions under interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the challenges in applying canonical quantization to higher derivative theories like the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, which typically suffer from instabilities and inconsistencies. The authors aim to establish a consistent framework for quantization and to investigate how such theories can lead to better ultraviolet behavior in Green functions, potentially offering insights into renormalization and high-energy physics phenomena.

Method: The authors employ canonical quantization methods to study the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator in a QFT context. They construct the Fock space and analyze the path integral formalism. A key methodological step is the inclusion of a Lagrange multiplier field in the path integral to handle constraints arising from higher derivatives, ensuring the canonical coordinates' consistent application. They also examine the ultraviolet convergence properties of Green functions in the presence of interactions.

Result: The paper demonstrates that incorporating a Lagrange multiplier field is essential for maintaining consistency in canonical quantization. It shows that the higher derivative terms lead to improved ultraviolet convergence of Green functions when interactions are present, which is a significant advantage over standardQFT models in managing high-energy behavior.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn is that the extended Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator model provides a viable framework for studying higher derivative theories within QFT. The introduced Lagrange multiplier ensures a consistent quantization procedure, and the improved ultraviolet convergence suggests potential applications in addressing renormalization issues and exploring quantum field theories at high energies.

Abstract: In this work, we study the Quantum Field Theory version of the higher
derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator. We quantize canonically this system and
construct its Fock space, as well as study its path integral. We demonstrate
that the inclusion of canonical coordinates in the path integral necessarily
introduces a new field, a Lagrange multiplier, which is essential for the
consistent application of these coordinates in the canonical quantization
framework. Finally, we analyze the improved ultraviolet convergence of the
Green functions that this theory exhibits in the presence of an interaction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We have studied how the thermoelectric properties of the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP) are affected by a weak-momentum anisotropy arising from the asymptotic
expansion of matter in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions. The highly energetic medium produced in such collisions exhibits a
notable temperature difference between its central and peripheral regions. This
temperature gradient induces an electric field whose magnitude per unit
temperature gradient, in the limit of vanishing electric current, defines the
Seebeck coefficient of the medium. We have calculated the Seebeck coefficient
for both individual quark flavors and the entire QGP medium in the presence of
expansion-induced anisotropy by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport
equation in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory
framework. The partonic interactions are incorporated through their effective
thermal masses within the quasiparticle model for an anisotropic QGP medium. We
have observed that the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark
flavor as well as for the entire QGP medium increases in the presence of
expansion-induced anisotropy, indicating a stronger induced electric field in
the anisotropic medium compared to the isotropic case. Given that an increase
in the Seebeck coefficient may lead to observable signatures such as charge
asymmetries in particle distributions and to modifications in the transport
behavior of the QGP, these results may provide useful input for future
phenomenological studies investigating the internal structure and phase
properties of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions.

*Zaki Panjsheeri,Douglas Q. Adams,Adil Khawaja,Saraswati Pandey,Kemal Tezgin,Simonetta Liuti*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an updated parametrization of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) using high-precision electron-nucleon scattering data and lattice QCD results, focusing on the vector sector GPDs H and E. Uncertainty quantification is included, and parametric forms are provided at a specific scale, along with Compton form factors for DVCS processes in various collider settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the description of nucleon structure by rigorously constraining partonic components of GPDs using latest experimental and lattice QCD data, ensuring consistency with pQCD evolution and providing reliable uncertainty estimates for theoretical predictions.

Method: Parametrization of quark, antiquark, and gluon GPDs for H and E using constraints from electron-nucleon DIS data and updated lattice QCD moments. Parametric forms at Q₀² = 0.58 GeV² are constructed, incorporating variables x, ξ, t. Uncertainties quantified via rigorous fitting methods, with evolution under LO pQCD equations applied.

Result: Parametric forms for all relevant GPD components (H_{u_v}, H_{d_v}, etc.) and their E counterparts are determined with uncertainties. Compton form factors for DVCS are computed for both fixed target and EIC kinematics, providing essential inputs for future collider experiments.

Conclusion: The updated parametrization offers a precise and consistent framework for studying nucleon structure through GPDs, bridging DIS data and lattice QCD, enabling predictions for upcoming experiments at electron-ion colliders and other facilities.

Abstract: An updated flexible parametrization of the generalized parton distributions
in the quark, antiquark and gluon sectors is presented using constraints from
high precision electron nucleon deep inelastic scattering data, as well as from
the $u$, $d$ quark and gluonic contributions to the nucleon electromagnetic
elastic form factors. The latter include recently updated lattice QCD moment
calculations. The generalized parton distributions in the vector sector are $H$
and $E$. We rigorously constrain the partonic components, $H_{u_v}$, $H_{d_v}$,
$H_{\bar{u}}$, $H_{\bar{d}}$, $H_{\bar{s}}$ and $H_{g}$, and the analogous
quantities for $E$, with proper uncertainty quantification. These distributions
obey leading order perturbative QCD evolution equations in $\alpha_S$.
Parametric forms at the initial scale, $Q_o^2 = 0.58$ $\mathrm{GeV}^2$, for
both quarks and gluon distributions are presented as a function of the relevant
kinematic variables, namely, the parton momentum fraction, $x$, the skewness,
$\xi$, and the invariant, $t$. We also present the Compton form factors
entering the deeply virtual Compton scattering process in the kinematic regimes
for both fixed target and electron-ion collider settings.

Abstract: The upcoming MUonE experiment aims to precisely measure the running of the
fine structure constant via elastic muon-electron scattering, to shed light on
the current tension in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. In addition to its
primary function as a precision experiment, MUonE also offers a unique testing
ground to probe long-lived vector bosons. Such vector bosons can be produced
via $\mu e \to \mu e V$ or $\mu N \to \mu N V$ scattering and decay into an
electron/positron pair a few centimeters away from the interaction point. With
its high-resolution tracking system and unique geometric design, MUonE is
well-suited to reconstruct displaced vertices close to the target, allowing it
to probe parameter space previously unattainable at colliders and
longer-baseline beam dump experiments. We present a comprehensive study of the
discovery potential of BSM vector boson mediators at the MUonE experiment. We
show that MUonE can fill the long-standing gap in the parameter space of vector
boson mediators with masses up to around 100 MeV.

Abstract: We study chiral symmetry breaking and restoration in accelerating and
rotating frames using low-energy effective models. By analyzing the chiral
condensate in Rindler coordinates, we show that different renormalization
schemes lead to distinct conclusions in accelerating frame: the scheme with
subtracting divergences in Rindler vacuum supports an acceleration-independent
critical temperatures, while the other scheme with subtracting divergences in
Minkowski vacuum suggests enhanced critical temperature. We further investigate
system with both rotation and acceleration. We find that the critical
acceleration (see definition in Section V) for chiral symmetry restoration
decreases with angular velocity, indicating cooperative effects from
acceleration-induced thermalization and rotation-induced effective chemical
potential.

### [47] [Quantum Error Correction-like Noise Mitigation for Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Quantum Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03253)
*Hajime Fukuda,Takeo Moroi,Thanaporn Sichanugrist*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantum error correction inspired noise mitigation protocol to boost sensitivity in wave-like dark matter searches using quantum sensors. The method achieves a sqrt(N) sensitivity improvement with N sensors and matches the standard quantum limit despite the unknown phase of dark matter fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark matter searches using quantum sensors face noise limitations, especially from excitations parallel to the signal. Traditional methods cannot fully mitigate this without knowing the dark matter phase. This protocol aims to overcome this barrier to enhance sensitivity and applicability.

Method: The protocol employs multiple quantum sensors to collectively suppress noise. By treating noise mitigation akin to quantum error correction, it cancels out phase-independent noise components. The approach uses sensor arrays to average out noise while preserving the coherent signal component linked to dark matter.

Result: The protocol demonstrates a sqrt(N) enhancement in sensitivity when using N sensors. It achieves performance equivalent to the standard quantum limit, a theoretical optimum previously unattainable due to the unknown dark matter phase.

Conclusion: This method provides a universal strategy for improving quantum sensor arrays' sensitivity in detecting signals with unknown phases. It offers practical benefits for technologies like resonant cavity arrays and opens avenues for next-generation dark matter detection experiments.

Abstract: We propose a quantum error correction-like noise mitigation protocol for
enhancing the sensitivity of wave-like dark matter searches with quantum
sensors. Our protocol uses multiple sensors to mitigate the noise affecting
each sensor individually, allowing for the suppression of excitation noise that
is parallel to the dark matter signal. We demonstrate that our protocol can
improve the sensitivity to dark matter signals by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, where
$N$ is the number of sensors used. Furthermore, we find that our protocol
achieves the same performance as the standard quantum limit by the ideal
measurement, which is impossible to achieve due to the unknown phase of the
dark matter field. Our work can be widely applied to various types of signals
with unknown phases, and has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of
quantum sensors such as arrays of resonant cavities.

Abstract: The reduced cross section of the semiexclusive $(l,l'p)$ lepton scat tering
process irrespective of the type of interaction is determined mainly by bound
nucleon momentum distribution in target and nucleon final state interaction
with residual nucleus. These cross sections can be identified with distorted
nuclear spectral functions and therefore are similar up to Coulomb c orrections
for neutrino and electron scattering on nuclei. In this article we exploit this
similarity and use data with precise kinematics and large statistics for
semiexclusive electron scattering on oxygen target to test models employed in
the GENIE neutrino event generator. We find that these models can not reproduce
well the measured reduced cross sections in all allowed kinematic region and
the GENIE event generator needs to better describe both the nuclear ground
states and nucleon final state interaction. The approach presented in this
paper provides a great opportunity to test better the accuracy of nuclear
models of quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, employed in neutrino event
generators.

*Silvia Manconi,Christopher Eckner,Francesca Calore,Fiorenza Donato*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the Galactic Center (GC) as a target for detecting dark matter (DM) via gamma rays, addressing the Galactic Center Excess (GCE). By combining adaptive template fitting and pixel-count methods, they account for sub-threshold sources and astrophysical backgrounds. They find upper limits on DM annihilation cross sections for masses under 300 GeV, depending on DM density profiles. Their approach reduces uncertainties from diffuse backgrounds and uses simulated data validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The GC is considered a potential site for DM signals due to the GCE, but earlier interpretations attributed it to astrophysical sources like pulsars. This work aims to reassess the GC's viability for DM searches by improving background modeling and statistical methods to distinguish DM signals from astrophysical contributions.

Method: The authors use a mixed model combining DM annihilation and a stellar bulge component. They apply adaptive template fitting and pixel-count statistics to analyze Fermi-LAT data, focusing on sub-threshold point sources. This approach minimizes mismodeling of diffuse backgrounds and allows simultaneous fitting of DM and astrophysical signals.

Result: The analysis sets 95% CL upper limits on DM annihilation cross sections, providing stringent constraints for DM masses below ~300 GeV, contingent on the DM density profile used. Results are validated through tests on simulated datasets.

Conclusion: The GC remains a valuable target for low-mass DM searches when using improved modeling techniques that account for stellar bulge contributions and sub-threshold sources. The methodology reduces background uncertainties, enabling tighter limits on DM annihilation cross sections and better discrimination between DM and astrophysical explanations for the GCE.

Abstract: The Galactic Center (GC) is potentially hosting the largest indirect signal
from particle dark matter (DM), which in many well-motivated models would
produce gamma rays as their final states. However, this region has often been
dismissed for DM studies because of the evidence for an unexpected gamma-ray
component over astrophysical backgrounds at GeV energies, firstly discovered in
the data of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), the so-called
Galactic Center Excess (GCE). While this was initially considered to hint at
GeV thermal relics, recent work supports a GCE interpretation in terms of a
stellar population of millisecond pulsar-like sources in the Galactic bulge.
Building on this preference, we re-evaluate the GC as a powerful target for
indirect DM searches via gamma rays. This is achieved by combining adaptive
template fitting and pixel-count statistical methods to assess the role of
sub-threshold point sources in the observed \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray
counts, while minimizing the mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission
backgrounds. In a fully self-consistent way, the gamma-ray data are fitted with
a mixed model comprising a DM signal and a stellar bulge, both potentially
contributing to the GCE. The space left for signals from weak-scale DM particle
annihilations is quantified by extracting 95\% C.L. upper limits on the
annihilation cross section, which, depending on the DM density profile, result
in stringent limits for masses $\lesssim 300$ GeV. The robustness of our
results is supported by tests on simulated data.

Abstract: We present a unified analysis of $\overline{B}^0 \to
D^{(*)+}\ell^-\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and $\overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\pi^-$ decays
using the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The $B \to D^{(*)}$ transition form
factors are calculated at low $q^2$ and extrapolated to the high-$q^2$ region
using the latest lattice QCD results via a model-independent $z$-expansion.
This hybrid method provides a precise form factor description across the full
kinematic range. We then predict the branching fractions and the lepton flavor
universality ratios $R(D) = 0.336^{+0.014}_{-0.013}$ and $R(D^*) =
0.271^{+0.010}_{-0.010}$, which are consistent with the latest experimental
averages. Furthermore, we perform a correlated study of the nonleptonic $
\overline{B}^0 \to D^{(*)+}\pi^-$ decays, calculating both factorizable and
nonfactorizable amplitudes. To reduce hadronic uncertainties, we introduce and
calculate the differential ratio $R^{(*)}_{\pi/\ell}(q^2)$, defined between
nonleptonic and semileptonic decay rates, providing a sensitive test of
factorization and possible new physics effects. The predictions presented here
can be directly tested in ongoing Belle II and LHCb experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To account for non-negligible thermal effects in leptogenesis models, requiring accurate high-temperature behavior of particle physics models for reliable matter-antimatter asymmetry predictions.

Method: Derived full one-loop evaluation of thermal CP asymmetry factors for processes N_i→ϕ+L and ϕ→N_i+L, considering finite-temperature effects and comparing numerically with existing literature.

Result: Provided precise thermal CP asymmetry predictions and validated them against previous results, highlighting necessary corrections from thermal effects.

Conclusion: Accurate leptogenesis calculations must incorporate thermal effects via their high-temperature particle model behavior, with this work enabling more reliable estimates of the cosmological baryon asymmetry.

Abstract: We present in the conventional equilibrium approach to leptogenesis the
complete leading order prediction for the CP asymmetry factor in
finite-temperature decays involving Majorana neutrinos. As thermal effects are
generally not negligible, the knowledge of the high temperature behavior of the
underlying particle physics model, in particular that of mass generation, is
required for reliable estimates of matter-antimatter asymmetry through the
mechanism of leptogenesis. We present all necessary information needed to
obtain the full one-loop evaluation for the thermal CP asymmetry factors for
the processes $N_i\to \phi + L$ and $\phi \to N_i+L$ at temperatures where they
are kinematically allowed. We present a numerical comparison with previous
formulae given in the literature.

TL;DR: The study examines inclusive J/ψ production in proton-proton collisions at tens of GeV √s using PEGASUS with TMD gluon densities from KMR-based KL'2025 and CCFM-based LLM'2024 models. Key findings include scale dependence differences between models, distinct pT spectra due to gluon kT broadening, and dominance of color-octet mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how gluon TMDs influence J/ψ production near threshold and provide necessary theoretical predictions for the Spin Physics Detector (SPD) at NICA's upcoming measurements.

Method: Simulations using the PEGASUS event generator with TMD gluon densities from KL'2025 (KMR-based) and LLM'2024 (CCFM-based) parametrizations. Differential cross sections were compared across rapidity, transverse momentum, and renormalization/factorization scales. Color-singlet and color-octet channel contributions were also quantified.

Result: KL'2025 shows stable factorization-scale dependence, while LLM'2024 reveals limitations at low scales. p_T spectra hardening correlates with gluon k_T broadening in each model. Color-octet mechanisms dominate in the SPD energy regime.

Conclusion: The study highlights the sensitivity of quarkonium production to gluon TMD models, emphasizing the critical role of KL'2025 for accurate predictions. Results provide crucial groundwork for interpreting future SPD/NICA experimental data on J/ψ production.

Abstract: We investigate inclusive $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions at
tens of GeV $\sqrt{s}$ energy, relevant for forthcoming measurements with the
Spin Physics Detector (SPD) at NICA. Simulations are performed using the
PEGASUS event generator with transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) gluon
densities, comparing the recent KMR-based KL$'2025$ and CCFM-based LLM$'2024$
parametrizations. Differential cross sections in rapidity and transverse
momentum exhibit smooth, stable behavior under renormalization-scale variation,
while factorization-scale dependence exposes limitations of the LLM$'2024$ set
at low scales in contrast to KL$'2025$. Normalized $p_T$ spectra reveal
distinct hardening patterns linked to the underlying gluon $k_T$ broadening in
each model. The relative contributions of color-singlet and color-octet
channels are also quantified, demonstrating the dominance of color-octet
mechanisms in the SPD energy regime. These results provide the first detailed

offering timely theoretical guidance for upcoming $J/\psi$ measurements at

Result: A 95 GeV scalar mixing with the SM Higgs by ~0.1 mixing angle can be observed with 5σ significance at √s=250 or 200 GeV with 5 ab⁻¹ luminosity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances the discovery potential of the scalar resonance at upcoming electron-positron collider experiments.

Abstract: The observed indications for a new scalar resonance with a mass around
95\,GeV, initially reported by LEP and supported by CMS and ATLAS in di-photon,

\mu^- $ and $S \rightarrow b \bar{b}$ and optimizes the signal recognition
using the recoil-mass method. By employing deep neural networks for
signal-background discrimination, we demonstrate that a 95\,GeV scalar, mixing
with the Standard Model Higgs by an angle of $\sim$0.1, can be observed with a
5$\sigma$ significance at $\sqrt{s}$ = 250\,GeV or 200\,GeV with 5~ab$^{-1}$ of

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the decay dynamics of oscillons through interactions with an
external scalar field. To examine how robust the decay dynamics of oscillons
via parametric resonance we previously found in Li et al. 2025 are to the
specific form of the coupling, we extend the analysis to include a three-point
interaction $g_3\phi\chi^2$. We compute the Floquet exponents of the external
field $\chi$ under an oscillating oscillon background and analyze how the
instability bands depend on the coupling constants and the oscillon shapes.
Numerical simulations of the two-field system show that, similar to the
four-point case, the parametric resonance may cease before the oscillon is
destroyed, leaving a smaller oscillon that decays only perturbatively. This
indicates that the partial decay of oscillons through parametric resonance is a
generic phenomenon of oscillon-scalar couplings, qualitatively insensitive to
the specific interaction form, while the shape of instability bands, parameter
dependence, and the precise critical oscillon energies depend on the specific
coupling. Our findings provide further insights into the decay dynamics of
oscillons and their potential role in the post-inflationary reheating process.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates scalar hadronic molecules $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ with asymmetric quark contents using QCD sum rules. Their masses, couplings, and decay widths are calculated. $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ decays into $\eta_{b}B_{c}^{-}$ with a mass of 15728±90 MeV and width 93±17 MeV, while $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ decays via $\eta_{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ with mass 9712±72 MeV and width 70±10 MeV. These results guide experimental searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the existence of exotic hadronic molecules with asymmetric quark compositions and determine their properties for experimental validation.

Method: The QCD sum rule method, including two-point and three-point sum rules, was used to calculate masses, currents couplings, and partial decay widths. The three-point sum rules were applied to determine strong couplings at molecule-meson-meson vertices.

Result: Calculated masses and decay widths for $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ are provided. Dominant decay channels identified include $\mathcal{M}_{b}\to\eta_b B_c^-$ and $\mathcal{M}_c\to\eta_c B_c^+ + J/\psi B_c^{\ast+}$. The decay widths consider annihilation of heavy quark pairs.

Conclusion: The results provide theoretical predictions for these exotic particles, offering critical parameters for experimental detection at facilities like Belle II or LHCb.

Abstract: The hadronic scalar molecules $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ with
asymmetric quark contents $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ and $cc \overline{c}
\overline{b}$ are explored by means of the QCD sum rule method. Their masses
and current couplings are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The
obtained results show that they are strong-interaction unstable particles and
transform to ordinary mesons' pairs. The molecule $\mathcal{M} _{b}$
dissociates through the process $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{b}}\to \eta
_{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The decays $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{c}}\rightarrow \eta
_{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are dominant modes for the molecule
$\mathcal{M}_{c}$. The full decay widths of the molecules $\mathcal{ M}_{b}$
and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ are estimated using these decay channels, as well as ones
generated by the annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ and $c \overline{c}$ quarks in
$\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$, respectively. The QCD three-point sum
rule method is employed to find partial widths all of these channels. This
approach is required to evaluate the strong couplings at the
molecule-meson-meson vertices under consideration. The mass $m=(15728 \pm
90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_b] =(93 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$
of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{b}$, and $ \widetilde{m}=(9712 \pm
72)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_c]=(70 \pm 10)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ in the
case of $\mathcal{M}_{c} $ offer valuable guidance for experimental searches at
existing facilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a testable model at hadron colliders by studying DM annihilation processes contributing to relic density and collider signatures, addressing gaps in understanding loop-induced annihilations into colored SM particles.

Method: Computed two-loop QCD amplitudes for gluon and quark channels using projector technique, decomposed into scalar form factors, solved master integrals via IBP identities, and applied counterterm renormalization for UV-finiteness.

Result: Derived analytical expressions for form factors and UV-finite amplitudes, enabling NLO predictions for DM production/annihilation into SM colored particles.

Conclusion: The model offers a viable framework for testing DM scenarios at colliders, with results improving precision in relic density calculations and collider signal predictions.

Abstract: We investigate a UV-complete model in which the dark matter (DM) particle
interacts with gluons through a colored scalar mediator. This framework
provides a phenomenologically viable scenario testable at hadron colliders.
While mono-jet signatures are relevant for collider searches, zero-jet
processes correspond to complete annihilation of Standard Model (SM) particles
into DM, contributing to the relic density. In this work, we study dark matter
annihilation into SM colored particles, which in our model arises at leading
order from loop-induced processes. We compute the relevant two-loop QCD
amplitudes for both gluon and quark channels in dark matter production or
annihilation. The amplitudes are decomposed into scalar form factors using the
projector technique. Using integration-by-parts (IBP) identities, we obtain
analytical expressions for the form factors in terms of master integrals.
Ultraviolet divergences are removed via counterterm renormalization, yielding
UV-finite results. These results would enable predictions for dark matter
production or annihilation into SM colored particles at next-to-leading order
(NLO) in QCD.

### [57] [Stellar Bounds on Light Spin-2 Particles in Bimetric Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03707)
*Camilo García-Cely,Andreas Ringwald*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates the production and emission rates of light spin-2 particles in stellar environments using bimetric theory, considering plasma effects. By comparing energy-loss rates with stellar cooling observations, they set constraints on the particle's coupling and mass (5-30 eV range), which are competitive with existing dark matter limits if these particles constitute dark matter.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain theoretical models of light spin-2 particles (potential dark matter candidates) by leveraging astrophysical observation data from stellar cooling rates, addressing gaps in understanding their viability through photoproduction and bremsstrahlung processes in stellar interiors.

Method: Applied bimetric formalism to model spin-2 particle interactions in stellar plasma, calculated photonuclear and bremsstrahlung emission rates, incorporated Debye screening effects, then compared derived energy-loss rates against observational bounds from stars like white dwarfs or红 giants.

Result: Derived exclusion regions for spin-2 particle coupling constants and masses between 5-30 eV, showing competitiveness with cosmological/astrophysical limits. These constraints significantly narrow viable parameter spaces if the particles are dark matter.

Conclusion: Stellar cooling provides a powerful probe for light spin-2 dark matter candidates. The obtained constraints offer complementary insights to particle physics experiments and strengthen the exclusion of certain parameter regions in bimetric theories.

Abstract: Using the bimetric formalism, we compute the production and emission rates of
light spin-2 particles in non-degenerate stellar interiors through
photoproduction and bremsstrahlung processes, including the effects of plasma
screening. By comparing the resulting energy-loss rates with observational
limits on stellar cooling, we derive bounds on the coupling strength and mass
of the spin-2 particle. Assuming these particles are the dark matter of the
Universe, the obtained constraints are competitive with existing astrophysical
and cosmological limits, excluding a wide region of parameter space in the mass
range 5-30 eV.
