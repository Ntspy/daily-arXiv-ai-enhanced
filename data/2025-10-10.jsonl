This is one fundamental question, and it can be addressed\npartly by identifying how planets in habitable zones obtain water.\nHistorically, astronomers considered that water was delivered to the Earth via\ndynamical shake-up by Jupiter, which took place during the formation and\npost-formation eras (e.g., $\\lesssim 100$ Myr). This hypothesis has recently\nbeen challenged by a more dynamic view of planet formation; planet-forming\nmaterials move in protoplanetary disks via various physical processes such as\npebble drift and planetary migration. \\textit{Habitable Worlds Observatory}\n(HWO) will open a new window to address this important, but difficult question\nby discovering and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets around G-type stars. In\nthis article, we consider two possible working hypotheses: (1) the abundance of\nwater on planets in habitable zones has \\textit{any} correlation with the\npresence of outer planets; and (2) the abundance of water on planets in\nhabitable zones has \\textit{no} correlation with the presence of outer planets.\nWe discuss what physical parameters need to be measured to differentiate these\ntwo hypotheses and what observational capabilities are desired for HWO to\nreliably constrain these physical parameters."}

Most studies employ absorption\nline spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind\nstreamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid\nthis issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range\nof sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind.

While, e.g., MeV/GeV\ngamma-rays from the neutron stars are also possible heating sources, X-ray\nobservations are currently much more sensitive, and therefore, joint\noptical--X-ray data are observationally unique on the irradiation mechanism\ninvestigation. Using 18 X-ray/B-band simultaneous XMM-Newton observations (717\nks in total) of the redback system PSR J1023+0038 taken during the LMXB state,\nwe find a general trend that the amplitude of the B-band orbital modulation was\nlower when the observed X-ray flux was higher.

Many different cosmological\nscenarios have been proposed that establish the abundance of axion DM in\nqualitatively different ways. In this paper we emphasize that, despite this\nvariety of backgrounds, the perturbations in axion DM can be understood from\nuniversal principles. How does a feebly interacting axion field acquire\nperturbations proportional to those of photons? How do the isocurvature power\nspectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the background evolution of the\nuniverse? We answer these questions for a completely general choice of\ncosmological background and temperature-dependent axion potential. We show that\nthe most general solution to the axion field equation on super-horizon scales\nis entirely determined by the family of background solutions for different\ninitial field values $\\theta_{\\rm ini}$. This holds for both the component in\nthe field perturbation solution contributing to the DM isocurvature\nperturbation (enhanced at late times by the sensitivity of the DM abundance to\nthe initial condition, $\\partial \\Omega_a / \\partial \\theta_{\\rm ini}$, which\ncan be large for initial conditions near the hilltop), and the other component\nthat contributes to the DM curvature perturbation. In particular, we explain\nthat an unperturbed axion field in the early universe evolving into one with\nnontrivial adiabatic perturbations is guaranteed by Weinberg's theorem on\nadiabatic modes. These results have been derived before with various\nassumptions, such as a radiation dominated background or a quadratic potential.\nOur aim is to give a clear, simple derivation that is manifestly independent of\nthose assumptions, and thus can be applied to any cosmological axion scenario."}

For this reason, the\ndata from many state-of-the-art spectroscopic surveys suffer from low\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, and prevent accurate estimates of the stellar\npopulation parameters. In this paper, we tackle the issue of denoising an\nensemble by the use of unsupervised Deep Learning techniques trained on a\nhomogeneous sample of spectra over a wide range of S/N. These methods\nreconstruct spectra at a higher S/N and allow us to investigate the potential\nfor Deep Learning to faithfully reproduce spectra from incomplete data.

By\ncontrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity\n$e_{10\\mathrm{Hz}}\\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques\nto act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding\nmore isotropic $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and\ntorque efficiencies are modest.

This paper explores further the scale function source term to\nconstruct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of\nboth Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It\nis shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry\ncomprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of\nlength units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally\nfixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in\nwhich the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity\nis obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same\nprocedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke\ngravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from\ntheir Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the\nMach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is\ncontrolled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known\nscalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular\nLyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls\nthe unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from\nthe perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry\nmakes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the\nsame theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally.\nThe Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring\nscalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of\nthe energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein\nframe."}

A successful fit to neutrino oscillation data requires the\nsimultaneous presence of one- and two-loop neutrino mass contributions.

This\ntensor can in principle be constructed from scalar-field gradients, vector\nfields, or field-strength contractions. We show this transformation results in\nthe conventional Dirac action being modified by additional kinetic and\naxial-current couplings that are quadratic in the shifted field. When the field\nsourcing the metric shift takes on a non-trivial background value, apparent\nLorentz-violating effects can result, which we identify as terms in an\neffective field theory. Assuming the well-motivated cases of scalar and vector\nultralight dark matter, we demonstrate that experimental tests of rotation and\nboost violation imply constraints on the additional kinetic coupling.

We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public\nGPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to\nwithin $\\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while\ncollapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX\n4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at\nresolutions and complexities previously out of reach.
