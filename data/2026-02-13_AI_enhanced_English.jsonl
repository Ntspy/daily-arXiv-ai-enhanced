The lightcurves show strong, quasi-periodic oscillations involving rapid transitions between bright bursts and deep dips on timescales of a few tens of seconds. Flux-resolved spectroscopy indicates that high-flux intervals in both classes are dominated by a hot, optically thick accretion disc with steep Comptonized emission, whereas low-flux intervals correspond to a cooler or partially recessed disc and a harder coronal continuum. These transitions involve a systematic 1-2 keV drop in disc temperature and a pronounced hardening of the Comptonized component, with flux reductions of up to a factor of five. Using covariance spectra across 0.015-5 Hz, we show that the rapid coherent variability arises almost entirely from the disc, which exhibits strong energy-dependent variations, while the Comptonized component contributes minimally.

Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law.

A major challenge is that while the pseudoscalar-meson couplings are well-determined, the couplings for scalar- and vector-meson exchanges render significant model dependence. To ensure the reliability of our predictions and reduce model dependence, we recalibrate the coupling constants of the OBE model. We treat the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$, or equivalently the scalar $\u03c3$-exchange coupling constant, as the only unknown parameter. The coupling constants for the vector $\u03c1$- and $\u03c9$-exchanges are determined by the pole positions of the well established states $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$.
