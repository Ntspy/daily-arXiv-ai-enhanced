They analyze the real and imaginary parts of GPD amplitudes to assess entanglement, Bell violations, and non-stabilizerness. Polarization predictions use theoretical frameworks validated by hyperon polarization analogies.", "result": "Entanglement, Bell nonlocality, and non-stabilizerness are observed in specific kinematic regions. Massive quarks (s, c, b) show significant transverse polarization (50-80%) in certain low-energy EIC conditions, analogous to hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions.", "conclusion": "GPD-based analysis successfully uncovers quantum correlations in DIS-produced quark pairs, highlighting regions with measurable entanglement signatures. The predicted high polarization for strange/charm/beauty quarks offers clear experimental targets at the Electron-Ion Collider for probing QCD dynamics and quark-gluon correlations in nucleons."}}
