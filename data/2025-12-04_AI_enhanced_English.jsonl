We propose the filaments arose from the Rayleigh-Taylor-unstable nature of the interface between the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the shocked wind launched by the natal WD; the filaments then elongated intact due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz-stable nature of the large initial density contrast between the wind and CSM, supplemented by the slowly declining wind density profile (relative to homologously expanding ejecta). To support this interpretation, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and derive the filament properties, including their speed, density, and temperature, all of which are consistent with observations. We suggest the filaments elongate until the wind and CSM densities become comparable at the contact discontinuity, which occurs within 1--10 years, and then truncate because the RTI halts. The subsequent KHI growth timescale across the current width of the filaments is longer than the age of Pa 30, so they remain intact. The filament-less central region in Pa 30 is therefore more likely a consequence of the finite timescale over which the RTI operates, rather than a wind termination shock.

Accurate characterization of the detector response is crucial for proper interpretation of the collected data. Previously, this was achieved through laboratory measurements of the analog chain and simulations and measurements of the antenna's directional response. In this paper, we perform an absolute calibration using the continuously monitored sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission. Calibration is done by comparing the average frequency spectra recorded by the stations with predictions from seven different models of the full radio sky, accounting for the system response, which includes the antenna, filters, and amplifiers. The analysis of the calibration constants over a period of seven years shows no relevant and no significant ageing effect in the AERA antennas. This result confirms the long-term stability of the detector stations and demonstrates the possibility for a radio detector to effectively monitor ageing effects of other detectors operating over extended periods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

After distinguishing fine-grained, coarse-grained, and generalized gravitational entropy, and formulating a cosmological coarse-grained entropy, we treat black hole evaporation, wormholes constrained by quantum energy inequalities, and two-time boundary-value frameworks (including absorber-type and two-state-vector formalisms) within a common information-theoretic language.

Arnett modeling of the bolometric light curve, combined with Fe II velocities, yields a nickel mass of about 0.2 solar masses, an ejecta mass of about 3.2 solar masses, and a kinetic energy of about 23x10^51 erg, corresponding to a high specific kinetic energy of about 7x10^51 erg per solar mass.

We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores parity-violating effects in gravitational waves using Chern-Simons modified gravity, showing that tensor perturbations in a de Sitter universe exhibit chiral dispersion relations, birefringence, and helicity-dependent amplification linked to a scalar field background.

In this review, we explore the proposed continua that link hydrogen-rich Type II SNe to stripped-envelope explosions (IIb-Ib-Ic), and that extend further into interaction-dominated and superluminous events. We discuss the physical processes-stellar winds, binary interaction, eruptive outbursts, and circumstellar interaction-that may produce graded outcomes across classes, while highlighting where observational evidence supports or challenges smooth transitions. We propose that CCSNe are better viewed as a multidimensional continuum of explosion outcomes, where traditional subclasses act as reference points rather than strict boundaries. Future progress will rely on large, homogeneous datasets and advanced modeling to disentangle true evolutionary sequences from apparent overlaps, ultimately connecting progenitor pathways to the observed diversity of explosions", "AI": {"tldr": "The review proposes that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) should be understood as a continuum rather than discrete subclasses, influenced by continuous variations in progenitor structure, mass-loss, and environment.

Observations align with continuous variation caused by progenitor variables. Challenges remain in distinguishing evolutionary sequences from observational overlaps without further data and modeling.", "conclusion": "The conclusion advocates redefining CCSN classification as a continuum to better capture the continuous nature of explosion diversity.

Their coupling to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV gamma-ray sources.\n  Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended magnetic field of strength O(10$\u03bc$G) through which escaping photons traverse, making it an excellent target to study ALPs.\n  Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity.\n  Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level. We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range $2 \\times 10^{-7}$eV $\\lesssim m_a \\lesssim 4 \\times 10^{-7}$eV and at the coupling strength of $g_{a\u03b3} \\gtrsim 3 \\times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to 80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies.\n  Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and advocate for its...", "AI": {"tldr": "No evidence for axion-like particles (ALPs) was found in the 2017 NGC 1275 flare data.
