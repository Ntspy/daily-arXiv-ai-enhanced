### [1] [Thermodynamics and shadow of Simpson-Visser black hole with phantom global monopoles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03888)
*Ahmad Al-Badawi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the thermodynamics and shadow structure of a non-rotating Simpson-Visser black hole with a phantom global monopole, focusing on how parameters like coupling constant, energy scale, and bounce parameter influence stability, temperature, and observable features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the presence of a phantom global monopole and specific parameters (ξ, η, a) affect the thermodynamic stability and geometric properties of black holes, including their photon sphere and shadow observables.

Method: Analytical methods using thermodynamic analysis (specific heat, free energy) and null geodesic solutions to study horizon structure, stability, and photon orbit characteristics.

Result: Small-horizon black holes are locally stable but not globally preferred. The photon sphere radius depends on both η and a, while the critical impact parameter is independent of a. Increasing η expands photon sphere and impact parameter for ordinary monopoles but reduces them in the phantom scenario.

Conclusion: The bounce parameter and phantom global monopole significantly modify the black hole's thermodynamics and shadow properties, altering fundamental predictions for observational testing.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and shadow of a non-rotating Simpson Visser black hole with a phantom global monopole. The model is governed by three parameters: the coupling constant $ξ$, the energy scale of symmetry breaking $η$, and the bounce parameter $a$, which jointly influence horizon structure and observational signatures. Using specific heat and free-energy analysis, we show that small-horizon configurations are locally thermodynamically stable but never globally favored. Analytical solutions of null geodesics reveal that the photon sphere radius depends on the bounce parameter $a$ and the energy scale of symmetry breaking $η$, while the critical impact parameter is still unaffected by $a$. Moreover, the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter, showing that increasing $η$ enlarges both quantities for an ordinary global monopole, while reducing them in the phantom case. Our results highlight how the bounce parameter and phantom global monopole significantly alter the black hole's physical and geometric properties.

### [2] [Comparative Analysis of Holographic Dark Energy Models in $f(R,T^2)$ Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03898)
*M. Sharif,M. Zeeshan Gul,I. Hashim*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores various holographic dark energy models (Rényi, Sharma-Mittal, Generalized) in f(R,T²) gravity using Hubble and Ricci horizons as infrared cut-offs. It finds that these models can describe both phantom and quintessence phases of cosmic expansion, supporting the observed accelerated expansion. This underscores the connection between holographic models and modified gravity theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different holographic dark energy models behave within the f(R,T²) gravity framework and their capability to explain cosmic acceleration through phantom and quintessence phases. The study aims to bridge holographic dark energy concepts with modified gravity theories.

Method: The authors analyzed Rényi, Sharma-Mittal, and Generalized Holographic dark energy models in f(R,T²) gravity using Hubble and Ricci horizons as infrared cut-offs in a non-interacting Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. They reconstructed gravitational models, performed stability analysis, and examined the equation of state parameter's evolution.

Result: The reconstructed f(R,T²) models successfully describe both phantom and quintessence phases, aligning with observed cosmic acceleration. Stability analysis confirms validity, highlighting a strong link between holographic dark energy and modified gravity.

Conclusion: Holographic dark energy models within f(R,T²) gravity effectively explain cosmic expansion phases. The findings reinforce the interplay between these models and modified gravity, providing insights into large-scale cosmic dynamics.

Abstract: This study investigates the Renyi Holographic dark energy, Sharma-Mittal Holographic dark energy and Generalized Holographic dark energy models in the framework of $f(R,T^2)$ gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^2$ represents the self-contraction of the stress-energy tensor. For this purpose we employed two horizons as infrared cut-offs, such as Hubble horizon and Ricci horizon. The analysis is conducted for a non-interacting scenario in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By considering a specific form of this modified gravity, we reconstruct the corresponding gravitational models based on these selected dark energy formulations. Additionally, a stability analysis is performed for all cases and the evolution of the equation of state parameter is examined. Our finding indicates that the reconstructed $f(R,T^2)$ models effectively describe both the phantom and quintessence phases of cosmic evolution, aligning with the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. This study highlights the deep interconnections between holographic dark energy models and modified gravity theories, offering valuable insights into the large scale dynamics of the cosmos.

### [3] [Strong field gravitational lensing of particles by a black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04218)
*Guansheng He,Jiaxu Huang,Zhongwen Feng,Ghulam Mustafa,Wenbin Lin*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines gravitational lensing effects on both relativistic and nonrelativistic massive particles around a black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole in the strong deflection limit. It derives key lensing observables for relativistic images and evaluates detectability using the Galactic black hole Sgr A* as a lens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how velocity differences (compared to light speed) affect gravitational lensing observables in regular spacetime geometries, specifically the black-bounce-Schwarzschild model, and assess their detectability in astrophysical scenarios.

Method: The authors start with equations of motion for massive particles in regular spacetime, derive particle sphere equations (reducing to photon sphere equations at light speed), then use strong field limit methods to compute deflection angles and lensing observables. They analyze velocity-dependent effects on these observables and apply results to Sgr A*.

Result: Key observables include particle sphere angular radius, angular separation between relativistic images, and flux magnification ratios. Velocity differences alter critical impact parameters and lensing coefficients. Detectability analysis shows potential for distinguishing black-bounce spacetime effects via upcoming high-resolution observations.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant velocity-dependent modifications to strong deflection lensing in regular black holes. Observational signatures could be measurable with advanced instruments, offering tests for alternative gravity theories through Sgr A* lensing events.

Abstract: The gravitational lensing of relativistic and nonrelativistic neutral massive particles in the black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is investigated in the strong deflection limit. Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated. Serving as an application of the results, we finally concentrate on evaluating the astronomical detectability of the velocity effects on the lensing observables and analyzing their dependence on the parameters, by modeling the Galactic supermassive black hole (i.e., Sgr A$^{\ast}$) as the lens.

### [4] [Impact of Higher-Order Modes on Eccentricity Measurement in Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04642)
*Honglue Tang,Jinzhao Yang,Baoxiang Wang,Tao Yang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines biases in BBH eccentricity measurements when neglecting higher-order gravitational wave modes. Analysis of six events shows no significant bias, but simulations indicate significant biases occur in high-mass (≳120M☉), unequal mass (q≳4), edge-on (θJN≳30°), and high-SNR systems. Future measurements of massive asymmetric BBHs need HOM-inclusive models to prevent false eccentricity claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the impact of neglecting higher-order modes in gravitational wave models on eccentricity estimation for BBH mergers, ensuring accurate analyses and avoiding systematic errors in parameter inferences.

Method: The method involves Bayesian inference using the SEOBNRv5EHM (with HOMs) and SEOBNRv5E (dominant modes only) models to reanalyze six GW events. Additionally, a zero-noise injection campaign varied parameters like mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and SNR to identify vulnerable regimes.

Result: No significant eccentricity biases from HOM omission were found in the analyzed events. However, biases (Δe/σ>1) emerge in systems with high detector-frame mass (≳120M☉), high mass ratios, edge-on orientations, and high SNRs. Low-mass systems show negligible bias.

Conclusion: Current eccentric GW candidates are unaffected by HOM neglect. Future observations of massive, asymmetric, or edge-on BBHs require HOM-inclusive waveform models to avoid systematic errors leading to false eccentricity detections.

Abstract: We investigate the systematic biases in measuring orbital eccentricity for binary black hole (BBH) mergers that arise when higher-order modes (HOMs) of gravitational waves are neglected in waveform modeling. Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($Δ_e/σ> 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\rm det}\gtrsim120M_\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($θ_\textrm{JN} \gtrsim 30^\circ$), and high SNRs ($ρ^N_\textrm{mf}\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\rm det}\gtrsim140M_\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\rm det}\sim100 M_\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.

### [5] [Light deflection in the gravimagnetic dipole spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04376)
*Clémentine Dassy,Jan Govaerts*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses a gravimagnetic dipole solution in GR featuring two equal-mass black holes with opposite NUT charges connected by a Misner string. By tuning separation distance to eliminate string tension, it creates a stable system of oppositely rotating black holes. Gravitational lensing effects are observed in particle geodesics for certain source configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate systems of interacting black holes with non-trivial topological properties (Misner strings) and their stability, as well as gravitational lensing effects in such unique spacetime configurations.

Method: Derived an axisymmetric vacuum solution of Einstein's equations for two black holes with opposite NUT charges. Numerically simulated massless particle geodesics to analyze lensing effects on equatorial plane and vertical axis observers.

Result: Achieved tension-free Misner string by matching black hole separation, creating stable configuration with oppositely rotating holes. Observed distinct lensing patterns depending on source/in observer positions relative to the black hole system.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of gravimagnetic dipole systems as new testbeds for studyingstationary multi-black hole interactions, topological defects, and lensing in strongly curved spacetimes.

Abstract: The gravimagnetic dipole is an asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's General Relativity describing two non-extreme black holes with equal masses and opposite NUT charges connected by a Misner string. The string tension's can be set to zero by choosing the black hole separation accordingly, yielding a stable system of oppositely rotating black holes at a fixed distance. Numerical simulations of massless particle geodesics reveal gravitational lensing effects for extended sources at infinity on the equatorial plane or on the vertical axis.

### [6] [Chaotic Dynamics in Extremal Black Holes: A Challenge to the Chaos Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04423)
*Surojit Dalui,Chiranjeeb Singha,Krishnakanta Bhattacharya*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzes chaotic dynamics in extremal Reissner-Nordström and Kerr black holes, showing they violate the MSS chaos bound by maintaining positive Lyapunov exponents at zero temperature. Chaos decreases but persists in extremal Reissner-Nordström, while it increases with spin in Kerr.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether extremal black holes obey the MSS chaos bound and understand their dynamical behavior at zero temperature.

Method: Examining massless particle motion using two approaches: taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and directly analyzing extremal backgrounds in both Reissner-Nordström and Kerr geometries.

Result: Extremal black holes retain chaos (positive Lyapunov exponent) at zero temperature, violating the MSS bound. Chaos diminishes in extremal Reissner-Nordström but strengthens with spin in Kerr.

Conclusion: Extremal black holes represent distinct dynamical phases of gravity with residual chaos beyond the MSS bound.

Abstract: We investigate chaotic dynamics in extremal black holes by analyzing the motion of massless particles in both Reissner-Nordström and Kerr geometries. Two complementary approaches (i) taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and (ii) working directly in the extremal background, yield consistent results. We find that, contrary to naive extrapolation of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos bound, the Lyapunov exponent remains positive even at zero temperature. For Reissner-Nordström black holes, chaos diminishes but persists at extremality, while for Kerr black holes it strengthens with increasing spin. These results demonstrate that extremal black holes exhibit residual chaotic dynamics that violate the MSS bound, establishing them as qualitatively distinct dynamical phases of gravity.

### [7] [Trapped photon region in the phase space of sub-extremal Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04502)
*Carla Cederbaum,Karim Mosani*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the geometric and topological properties of the trapped photon region in sub-extremal Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen spacetimes, demonstrating that its projection onto the (co-)tangent bundle forms a five-dimensional submanifold with topology SO(3)×ℝ², extending Cederbaum and Jahns' method for sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure of trapped photons in charged and rotating black hole spacetimes, generalizing previous results from Kerr to more complex spacetime models (Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen).

Method: Adaptation of Cederbaum and Jahns' method for sub-extremal Kerr spacetime analysis to study the trapped photon region's geometry and topology in Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen spacetimes.

Result: The projection of the trapped photon region onto the (co-)tangent bundle is a five-dimensional submanifold with topology SO(3)×ℝ² in both spacetime setups.

Conclusion: The topology and geometry of trapped photon regions in these spacetimes are characterized, providing insights into relativistic phenomena and extending applicability of existing analytical methods to include charged black hole solutions.

Abstract: We analyse the geometry and topology of the trapped photon region in the domain of outer communication of sub-extremal Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen spacetimes. Specifically, we show that its projection to the (co-)tangent bundle forms a five-dimensional submanifold with topology $SO(3)\times \mathbb{R}^2$ in each setup. The proof adapts the method of Cederbaum and Jahns for sub-extremal Kerr spacetime.

### [8] [A General Discussion on Photon Spheres in Different Categories of Spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04573)
*Chen-Kai Qiao,Ping Su,Yang Huang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates photon spheres in various spacetime categories, deriving universal geometric properties independent of metric forms, recovering recent theorems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how geometric/topological properties of spacetimes influence photon sphere existence/distribution across black holes, ultra-compact objects, regular spacetimes, and naked singularities.

Method: Geometric analysis of optical geometry in different spacetime categories to determine existence, total number (n), and stability difference (w) of photon spheres.

Result: Universal properties derived showing photon sphere characteristics depend on spacetime geometry, including n and w values. Recover existing theorems without relying on specific metrics.

Conclusion: Photon sphere behavior is fundamentally tied to spacetime optics geometry, not metric specifics, enabling broader theoretical insights across gravitational sources.

Abstract: Photon spheres have attracted considerable interest in the studies of black holes and other astrophysical objects. For different categories of spacetimes (or gravitational sources), the existence of photon spheres and their distributions are dramatically influenced by the geometric and topological properties of spacetimes and characteristics of the corresponding gravitational fields. In this work, we carry out a geometric analysis on photon spheres for different categories of spacetime (including black hole spacetime, ultra-compact object's spacetime, regular spacetime, and naked singularity spacetime). Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\text{stable}} + n_{\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes. These conclusions are derived solely from geometric properties of optical geometry of spacetimes, irrelevant to the specific spacetime metric forms. Besides, our results successfully recover some important theorems on photon spheres proposed in recent years.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper reports complex flaring activity in the galactic nucleus of eRASSt J234402.9-352640, detected via Einstein Probe and XMM-Newton observations, revealing quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) with recurring thermal flares and shorter, hotter flares that challenge existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the unique variability characteristics of the five-year-old tidal disruption event J2344 and understand its place within the QPE emitter population, while exploring new observational phenomena requiring theoretical re-evaluation.

Method: Temporal decomposition of XMM-Newton light curves and time-resolved spectral analysis were performed to identify flare structures and their temporal/spectral properties.

Result: Broad thermal QPEs recurring every ~12 hours, shorter hotter flares (5-30 minutes) during QPE rises and quiescence phases were discovered, marking the first such observation and expanding QPE phenomenology.

Conclusion: J2344 is confirmed as a new QPE emitter with unprecedented flare behavior, indicating the need for revised models potentially involving extreme-mass-ratio inspiral scenarios.

Abstract: We report the discovery of complex flaring activity from the galactic nucleus hosting the five-year-old tidal disruption event eRASSt J234402.9-352640 (J2344). With Einstein Probe and XMM-Newton observations, we detected highly structured soft X-ray variability. Through temporal decomposition of the XMM-Newton light curve and time-resolved spectral analysis, we identified broad, thermal flares recurring every $\sim$12 hours and lasting $\sim$2 hours, consistent with quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). Remarkably, these QPEs are accompanied by an unprecedented crest of hotter, shorter flares, each lasting between 5 and 30 minutes. These flares are predominantly found in the rising phases of the QPEs, although they also appear throughout the quiescence. These findings establish J2344 as a new member of the QPE emitter population and uncover a previously unobserved phenomenology that challenges current models of QPEs. In this letter, we present the phenomenological properties of this unique source and discuss possible interpretations within the framework of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.

### [10] [Modeling X-ray Bursting Neutron Star Atmospheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03982)
*Lourenzo Colleyn,Zach Medin,Alan Calder*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study verifies a computational model for simulating X-ray bursts on neutron stars, showing agreement with prior work through time-dependent atmospheric snapshots and analyzing effects like Compton scattering and opacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the accuracy of the computational model developed at LANL for simulating radiation transfer in X-ray bursting neutron star atmospheres, ensuring it aligns with theoretical expectations and previous research.

Method: The model was tested via a baseline case, analyzing the outgoing spectrum's color-correction factor, simulation time vs. flux relationships, and iterative refinement of atmospheric snapshots. Effects of varying optical depths, frequency-dependent opacities, and Compton scattering were also examined.

Result: Strong agreement with earlier work and theoretical predictions was found. The model successfully converges to the correct atmospheric state using iterative snapshots. Deviations from blackbody spectra were explained by opacity sources, and Compton scattering's role in photon energy redistribution was demonstrated.

Conclusion: The verified model provides a reliable tool for simulating X-ray burst atmospheres, offering insights into spectral deviations and energy redistribution mechanisms critical for astrophysical observations and理论预测.

Abstract: We present a verification of a computational model, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for simulating radiation transfer in X-ray bursting neutron star atmospheres. We tested a baseline case and demonstrated strong agreement in the behavior of the outgoing spectrum's color-correction factor with earlier work and theoretical expectations. By analyzing the relationship between the simulation time and outgoing flux, we also demonstrated how the model calculates through a sequence of time-independent atmospheric snapshots, each iteratively refined, and uses them to progressively converge toward the correct atmospheric state (as would be observed during a burst). We examined the behavior of the outgoing flux across different optical depths and explored the physical explanations for deviations from a pure blackbody spectrum, attributed to frequency-dependent opacity sources. Additionally, we assessed the impact of Compton scattering, highlighting its role in redistributing photon energies.

*Emily McPike,Rosalba Perna,K. E. Saavik Ford,Barry McKernan,Vera Delfavero,Miranda McCarthy,Kaila Nathaniel,Jake Postiglione,Nicolas Posner,Varun Pritmani,Shawn Ray,Richard O'Shaughnessy*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper uses the McFACTS code to predict electromagnetic counterparts to binary black hole mergers in AGN disks, showing that dense disks can efficiently produce observable EM signals for high-mass mergers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for statistical models to identify EM counterparts to GW events, which existing literature lacks, particularly for AGN disk mergers.

Method: The authors extended the McFACTS Monte Carlo code to model both GW observables and corresponding EM luminosities of BBH mergers in AGN disks, analyzing disk density effects and BH population parameters.

Result: Dense Sirko-Goodman-like disks drive hierarchical mergers leading to high-mass BH remnants with strong EM signals. Mergers with chirp mass >40 M☉ in such disks likely produce detectable EM counterparts if the disk is long-lived and has a top-heavy BH IMF.

Conclusion: AGN disks are viable sources of multi-messenger signals; future surveys can use these predictions to search for EM counterparts linked to GW events from these environments.

Abstract: The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising environments for producing binary black hole (BBH) mergers, which have been detected via gravitational waves (GW) with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). BBH mergers embedded in AGN disks are unique among GW formation channels in their generic ability to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, via interactions between the merger remnant and the surrounding disk gas (though these are not always observable). While such mergers represent valuable multi-messenger sources, the lack of predictive statistical models in existing literature currently limits our ability to select possible EM counterparts with GW detections in archival data and in real time using time-domain surveys such as ZTF or LSST. Here, we employ the Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing and Simulation code (\texttt{McFACTS}\footnote{https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts}) to predict the bolometric luminosities of jets and shocks associated with LVK-detectable BBH merger remnants in AGN disks. \texttt{McFACTS} predicts the distribution of GW observables for an underlying BH population and disk model. In this work we present a new capability that simultaneously generates the distribution of bolometric EM luminosities corresponding to these predicted GW detections. We show that (i) migration traps in dense, Sirko-Goodman-like AGN disks efficiently drive hierarchical BH mergers, yielding high-mass, high-spin BH remnants capable of powering observable EM counterparts across merger generations; and ii) mergers embedded in sufficiently dense disks with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}\gtrsim40M_\odot$ are highly likely to yield observable EM counterparts for sufficiently long-lived disks and top-heavy BH initial mass functions.

TL;DR: SN 2024abfl is a low-luminosity Type IIP supernova from a low-mass red supergiant progenitor, exhibiting unique spectral features like high-velocity Hα absorption and CSM interaction emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the diversity in Type IIP supernovae properties by analyzing a rare case with a directly detected progenitor.

Method: Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl combined with semi-analytical models to estimate explosion parameters and progenitor properties.

Result: Low plateau luminosity, long plateau duration, low ejecta velocities, unusual Hα features, and progenitor mass ≤15 M☉. Estimated 0.009 M☉ Ni-56, 0.42 foe kinetic energy, 8.3 M☉ ejecta mass.

Conclusion: SN 2024abfl represents a low-luminosity end of SNe IIP from low-mass RSGs, suggesting progenitor mass influences explosion energetics and observable features.

Abstract: Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) exhibit a significant diversity in their explosion properties, yet the physical mechanisms driving this diversity remain unknown. In this work, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a SN IIP in NGC 2146 with a directly detected red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. We find it has a low plateau luminosity ($M_V \sim -15$ mag) and a relatively long plateau length ($\sim 126.5$ days). By fitting a semi-analytical model, we estimated a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim 0.009 M_\odot$, an initial kinetic energy of $\sim 0.42$ foe, an initial thermal energy of $\sim 0.03$ foe and an ejecta mass of $\sim 8.3 M_\odot$. The spectral evolution of SN 2024abfl is similar to those of other SNe IIP, except for much lower ejecta velocities at similar epochs. At later epochs, we find a relatively high-velocity H$α$ absorption feature at $\sim -4000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly due to a fast-moving plume of matter in the inner ejecta, and two emission features at $\pm 2000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly caused by CSM interaction. We estimate the progenitor mass to be $\le 15 M_\odot$ based on nebular spectra. We conclude that SN 2024abfl is a low-luminosity SN IIP originating from a low-mass RSG progenitor.

### [13] [Emergence of cyclic flux eruptions in kinetic simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04519)
*Enzo Figueiredo,John Mehlhaff,Adrien Soudais,Benoît Cerutti*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the dynamics of black hole magnetospheres around a Schwarzschild black hole with spherical accretion using kinetic plasma simulations, revealing a three-stage flux cycle involving advection, reconnection-mediated slowdown, and explosive reconnection-driven eruptions linked to particle acceleration, analogous to Sgr A*'s flaring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unresolved issues in Bondi accretion with magnetic fields, particularly dissipation mechanisms and particle acceleration, which prior studies couldn't fully explain.

Method: 2D global general relativistic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for both pair and electron-ion plasmas, modeling spherical accretion onto a non-spinning black hole over long timescales to observe multiple flux eruption cycles.

Result: Three distinct phases detected: (1) ideal advection with flux linear growth, (2) reconnection events slowing flux increase, and (3) major reconnection eruptions expelling flux and accelerating particles. Quasi-periodic eruptions match Sgr A*'s flaring behavior.

Conclusion: Magnetic reconnection plays a critical role in regulating flux dynamics and enabling particle acceleration in spherical accretion, offering insights for observed flaring in quiescent black holes like Sgr A*.

Abstract: The dynamics of black hole magnetospheres critically depend on the black hole spin and on the structure of the accretion flow. In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium.

*Thomas Siegert,Francesca Calore,Pierre Jean,Mark Leising,Nicolas de Séréville,Gerald H. Share,Vincent Tatischeff,Wei Wang,Meng-Ru Wu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The chapter discusses the significance of MeV γ-ray lines in astrophysics, particle physics, and fundamental physics, highlighting their role in studying nucleosynthesis, cosmic rays, interstellar medium, positron annihilation, and potential beyond-standard-model physics. It emphasizes the need for advanced telescopes to address unresolved questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize MeV γ-ray line observations as a direct probe of astrophysical processes and fundamental physics, which are otherwise hard to investigate through other means. These observations help in understanding nucleosynthesis events, cosmic-ray interactions, interstellar medium dynamics, and potential new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Method: The chapter provides an overview of historical measurements and recent results in MeV γ-ray line studies. It synthesizes data from different astrophysical sources like massive stars, supernovae, novae, and neutron star mergers. Analysis includes flux ratio measurements for cosmic-ray spectra determination and tracing interstellar medium phases through γ-ray signatures.

Result: MeV γ-ray lines offer insights into ongoing nucleosynthesis, cosmic-ray distribution in the Milky Way, phases of the interstellar medium, and positron annihilation processes. They also hold potential for detecting signatures of beyond-standard-model physics. Current observations have limitations, necessitating next-generation telescopes.

Conclusion: Advanced MeV telescopes are essential to resolve open questions in γ-ray astronomy, such as precise nucleosynthesis diagnostics, detailed cosmic-ray mapping, and uncovering new physics through unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in the MeV range.

Abstract: The nuclear $γ$-ray lines in the MeV range of the electromagnetic spectrum hold a vast variety of astrophysical, particle-physical, and fundamental physical information that is otherwise extreme difficult to access. MeV $γ$-ray line observations provide the most direct evidence for ongoing nucleosynthesis in galaxies by measuring freshly produced radioactive isotopes from massive stars, supernovae, classical novae, or binary neutron star mergers. Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $γ$-ray lines. This Chapter gives an overview of historical $γ$-ray line measurements, newest results, and open questions that may only be solved by a new generation of MeV telescopes.

### [15] [Constraints on cyclotron features and accretion regime in the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 1700--37 from NuSTAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04622)
*Lautaro West-Ocampo,Federico A. Fogantini,Enzo A. Saavedra,Jorge A. Combi,Federico García,Pedro L. Luque-Escamilla,Josep Martí,Sylvain Chaty,Juan F. Albacete-Colombo*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of 4U 1700-37 using NuSTAR observations suggests a neutron star with a magnetic field of 1.7--4.4×10^12 G and quasi-spherical accretion, without detecting coherent pulsations or firm cyclotron lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the magnetic field strength of the compact object in 4U 1700-37 and elucidate its accretion dynamics, given the lack of confirmed pulsations and uncertainty in previous field estimates.

Method: Timing and spectral analysis of NuSTAR data using models for accreting pulsars, including simulated tests for cyclotron feature significance; intensity-resolved spectroscopy to assess line centroid shifts.

Result: No coherent pulsations detected (pulsed fraction <1.5%); spectra show residuals at ~20 and 40-50 keV, but features aren't definitive cyclotron lines; field constraints derived via accretion regime modeling.

Conclusion: The neutron star's magnetic field supports a quasi-spherical subsonic accretion model, providing reconciled constraints on field strength and addressing discrepancies in earlier line-energy measurements.

Abstract: 4U 1700-37 is a wind-fed high-mass X-ray binary hosting a compact object, likely a neutron star, accreting from O6.5 Iaf+ supergiant HD 153919. Coherent pulsations not firmly detected; magnetic field strength remains uncertain. We analyze NuSTAR observations to characterize hard X-ray timing and spectral properties, test robustness of candidate cyclotron features, and constrain magnetic field and accretion regime. We perform timing and spectral analysis of two observations, modeling spectra with continua used for accreting pulsars, and use simulations to assess significance of features. No coherent pulsations detected; pulsed fraction constrained below 1.5\%. Spectra are well described by absorbed blackbody plus cutoff power-law continuum, showing residuals around 20 keV and 40--50 keV. Features improve fits but do not constitute firm cyclotron detections. Intensity-resolved spectroscopy suggests possible shifts of apparent line centroid. Results favor neutron-star magnetic field of 1.7--4.4 $\times 10^{12}$ G and quasi-spherical subsonic accretion regime with equilibrium spin period $\sim 1.9$ ks. Analysis provides quantitative constraints on magnetic field and accretion physics, helping reconcile discrepant line-energy measurements.

### [16] [An Afterglow Study of the "New Year's Burst" GRB 220101A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04660)
*Agniva Roychowdhury,Tuomas Kangas,Andrew Fruchter,A. Pe'er,K. Bhirombhakdi,J. Graham,K. Misra,A. J. Levan,B. Cenko,A. Cucchiara,V. Cunningham,B. P. Gompertz,D. Perley,J. Racusin,N. R. Tanvir*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines the afterglow of GRB 220101A using multi-wavelength data, revealing unusual low circumburst densities and a steep decay index. This challenges standard ISM models, suggesting potential environmental factors like evacuated cavities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the afterglow behavior of GRB 220101A to understand circumburst medium properties and possible deviations from standard models.

Method: Multi-wavelength data analysis (X-ray to radio) combined with numerical models (afterglowpy) and analytic fits. Tested Top-hat and Gaussian jet scenarios for varying electron participation fraction (ξ=0.01-1.0).

Result: Light curves steepen at ~9 days with a decay index of ~2.99. Radio data favor ξ=1.0, but require extremely low CBM densities (~1e-4 cm^-3). Omitting radio data yields higher but still insufficient CBM densities (~0.01 cm^-3). Electron energy distribution index p ~2.05-2.40. Steep decay index differs significantly from p.

Conclusion: Observed low CBM densities conflict with expected ISM values, suggesting either model issues or GRBs exploding in low-density regions (e.g., evacuated cavities). Similar findings in other LAT GRBs imply systematic environmental factors affecting afterglow observations.

Abstract: We present a detailed broadband afterglow study of GRB 220101A ($10^4\lesssimΔT\lesssim10^7$ s) combining multi-wavelength data from soft X-rays until 6 GHz. The afterglow light curves in both X-ray and optical show distinct steepening around $\sim9$ days, followed by a sharp post-break decay index of $\sim2.99\pm0.10$. We fit the light curves using the afterglow modelling package \texttt{afterglowpy} for both Top-hat and Gaussian jets for different values of the electronic participation fraction $ξ$ from 0.01 to 1.0 and find that, although the radio behavior is well described by the $ξ=1.0$ case, the required circumburst medium (CBM) densities are very low, $<10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the resulting energy requirements are modest, $\sim10^{52}$ erg, with an electron energy distribution (EED) index $p\sim2.05$. Similar results are also obtained from an analytic model fit to the light curve, except the predicted $p$ is higher, $\sim2.40$. The observed post-break decay index of $2.99$ is at least 5$σ$ away from $p$, which is one of the steepest observed so far. We also find that when ignoring the radio observations, the CBM density is raised by a few orders of magnitude to $\sim0.01$ cm$^{-3}$ for $ξ=1.0$, still far from the expected ISM density ($>1$ cm$^{-3}$) of GRB environments, which are highly star forming regions. Similarly low ISM densities have been seen in modeling of other LAT GRBs as well, especially ones with reverse-shock features (e.g., GRBs 130427A, 160509A and 160625B), thereby hinting at either an issue with the standard model or possible evacuated cavities where GRBs explode.

### [17] [Ultralight time-oscillating scalars from magnetized compact stars: electrophilic radiation and photon propagation effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03953)
*Tanmay kumar Poddar,Gaetano Lambiase*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how ultralight scalars coupled to electromagnetic fields of magnetized compact stars can influence astrophysical observables, deriving constraints on scalar couplings using pulsars and magnetars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of ultralight scalars on phenomena like pulsar spin-down, orbital dynamics in binary systems, and photon propagation, while improving constraints on scalar couplings.

Method: The authors modeled scalar interactions with time-dependent and static charge densities in magnetospheres, analyzed effects on photon redshift, timing residuals, and electromagnetic fields. They applied these models to the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A, using observational data to constrain scalar couplings.

Result: Pulsar spin-down data provided weak bounds on scalar-electron couplings, but electromagnetic radiation measurements set the strongest astrophysical limits on scalar-photon couplings. Enhanced constraints could come from objects with stronger magnetic fields and lower-frequency observations.

Conclusion: Magnetized compact objects offer a novel observational window for testing ultralight scalar fields. Future observations targeting highly magnetized systems at lower frequencies could significantly improve existing coupling constraints.

Abstract: Ultralight scalars with electrophilic couplings to the time-dependent Goldreich-Julian charge density of magnetized compact stars can be radiated from their magnetospheres, contributing to pulsar spin-down. Coupling to the time-independent component of the charge density instead generates a quadrupolar scalar field profile, which may influence the orbital dynamics of binary systems. Such scalars can also interact with the time-varying electromagnetic fields of magnetized stars, modifying photon propagation and inducing observable effects in the redshift and residual time-delay measurements, as well as corrections to the background electromagnetic fields. We investigate these phenomena for the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A. Using spectral and timing observations, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron and scalar-photon couplings. While the bounds obtained on the scalar-electron coupling from pulsar spin-down are weaker than existing limits, electromagnetic radiation measurements yield the strongest astrophysical constraints to date on the scalar-photon coupling. Compact stars with stronger surface magnetic fields and observations at lower photon frequencies can improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality--cornerstones of quantum mechanics--have traditionally been investigated only in low-energy experimental settings. Only recently, these fundamental phenomena have come to be explored in the high-energy domain of particle physics, where collider experiments offer a powerful new platform for studying the phenomenology of quantum correlations. We present here recent results on the detection of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in processes such as tau-lepton, $WW$, and $ZZ$ pair production, illustrating the potential of Future Lepton Colliders to probe the quantum properties of fundamental interactions.

### [19] [Emergent equilibrium-like yields from nonequilibrium cascade dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04040)
*Takeshi Fukuyama*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores nonequilibrium cascades where fragile structures form via intermediate states, analyzing using Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. It shows rate equations are Markovian approximations, and retaining reservoir lifetimes introduces non-Markovian memory effects, offering a criterion for rate-based model validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand light-nuclei production in heavy-ion collisions and Bose-Einstein condensation in cosmology, where structures form indirectly through nonequilibrium processes.

Method: Uses Schwinger-Keldysh real-time formalism to analyze multi-component nonequilibrium dynamics, integrating out intermediate reservoirs to derive rate equations and examine memory effects.

Result: Demonstrates that memory effects from finite reservoir lifetimes cause time-delayed, history-dependent formation dynamics, providing a quantitative validity criterion for Markovian rate approximations.

Conclusion: Non-Markovian effects are crucial in far-from-equilibrium scenarios, requiring careful consideration of reservoir lifetimes to accurately model structure formation dynamics.

Abstract: We study nonequilibrium cascades in which fragile bound or coherent structures are formed through intermediate states rather than by direct equilibration. Motivated by light-nuclei production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and by Bose--Einstein condensation in cosmological settings, we analyze such processes within the Schwinger--Keldysh real-time formalism. We show that commonly used rate equations can be understood as a controlled Markovian approximation obtained by integrating out intermediate reservoirs in an underlying multi-component nonequilibrium dynamics. When the finite lifetime of these reservoirs is retained, non-Markovian memory effects naturally appear, leading to delayed and history-dependent formation dynamics. The associated memory time provides a quantitative criterion for the validity of reduced, rate-based descriptions far from equilibrium.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes net baryon and electric charge stopping in heavy-ion collisions using a statistical model. It introduces an oxygen-baseline observable, r^OX, sensitive to the neutron-skin thickness of the target nucleus, enabling extraction of the baryon-stopping parameter γ_B from experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively extract the excess baryon-stopping parameter γ_B and study the neutron-skin thickness of target nuclei via collision data.

Method: Statistical model analysis applied to isobar collisions (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) at 200 GeV. Introduces observable r^OX and examines its sensitivity across RHIC and LHC energies.

Result: Showed that γ_B can be derived from charge/baryon-stopping ratios. Found r^OX's central-to-peripheral ratio strongly correlates with neutron-skin thickness X.

Conclusion: The approach provides a viable method for determining neutron-skin properties using stopping observables in heavy-ion collisions.

Abstract: We analyse the net baryon (B) and net electric charge (Q) stopping in heavy-ion collisions using the statistical model. Focusing first on isobar collisions $\rm{Ru}+\rm{Ru}$ and $\rm{Zr}+\rm{Zr}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$~GeV, we show that the excess baryon-stopping parameter $γ_B \equiv (N_B/N_Q)\,(Z/A)$ can be quantitatively extracted from forthcoming RHIC measurements of charge- and baryon-stopping ratios. We then generalize the approach to other collision systems at RHIC and LHC energies and introduce an oxygen-baseline observable, $r^{OX}$, whose central-to-peripheral ratio exhibits strong and systematic sensitivity to the neutron-skin thickness of the target nucleus $X$.

### [22] [Charged lepton flavor violating decays $Z\to \ell_α\ell_β$ in the inverse seesaw](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04168)
*Adrián González-Quiterio,Héctor Novales-Sánchez*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores lepton flavor violation in Z boson decays via one-loop diagrams involving virtual neutral leptons from the inverse seesaw mechanism, linking neutrino mass generation to observable decay rates which future colliders may detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary objectives are understanding neutrino mass origins and investigating charged-lepton flavor violation, driven by neutrino oscillation data indicating massive, mixing neutrinos and the need to explain flavor non-conservation in nature.

Method: Calculates one-loop Z→ℓαℓβ decay amplitudes using virtual neutral leptons from inverse seesaw mechanisms. Analyzes both degenerate and non-degenerate heavy neutral lepton mass scenarios, incorporating MEG II constraints on μ→eγ decay to bound the non-unitary η matrix elements.

Result: Derives a proportionality relation Br(Z→ℓαℓβ) ∝ |ηβα|². Current ATLAS bounds are insufficient to probe inverse seesaw contributions, but future colliders like FCC/CEPC could achieve sufficient sensitivity to test this mass generation mechanism.

Conclusion: Future high-sensitivity experiments are necessary to observationally confirm or constrain the inverse seesaw mechanism via Z boson decays, bridging neutrino physics with charged-lepton flavor violation studies.

Abstract: After confirmation of massiveness and mixing of neutrinos, by neutrino oscillation data, the origin of neutrino mass and the occurrence of charged-lepton-flavor non-conservation in nature have become two main objectives for the physics of elementary particles. Taking inspiration from both matters, we address the decays $Z\to\ell_α\ell_β$, with $\ell_α\ne\ell_β$, thus violating charged-lepton flavor. We calculate the set of contributing one-loop diagrams characterized by virtual neutral leptons, both light and heavy, emerged from the inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of neutrino mass. By neglecting charged-lepton and light-neutrino masses, and then assuming that the mass spectrum of the heavy neutral leptons is degenerate, we find that a relation $\textrm{Br}\big( Z\to\ell_α\ell_β\big)\propto\big| η_{βα} \big|^2$, with $η$ the matrix describing non-unitarity effects in light-lepton mixing, is fulfilled. Our quantitative analysis, which considers both scenarios of degenerate and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutral leptons, takes into account upper bounds on $η_{μe}$, imposed by current constraints on the decay $μ\to eγ$ from the MEG II experiment, while projected future sensitivity of this experiment is considered as well. We find that, even though current constraints on $Z\to\ell_α\ell_β$, by the ATLAS Collaboration, remain far from inverse-seesaw contributions, improved sensitivity from in-plans machines, such as the Future Circular Collider and the Circular Electron Positron Collider, shall be able to probe this mass-generating mechanism through these decays.

*Jie Lu,Guo-Liang Yu,Dian-Yong Chen,Zhi-Gang Wang,Bin Wu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes electroweak transition form factors for heavy baryon decays using three-point QCD sum rules, incorporating perturbative QCD and vacuum condensates up to dimension 8. The calculated form factors are used to study semileptonic decay widths, branching ratios, lepton universality ratios, and asymmetry parameters, showing approximate SU(3) symmetry and potential insights for new physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate electroweak transition form factors and decay processes of heavy baryons (Σ_b→Σ_c, Ξ'_b→Ξ'_c, Ω_b→Ω_c) systematically using QCD sum rules, enhancing understanding of weak decays and testing SU(3) symmetry while probing potential beyond the Standard Model physics.

Method: Three-point QCD sum rules framework includes full Dirac structure analysis on the phenomenological side and comprehensive QCD calculations with both perturbative terms and vacuum condensates up to dimension 8. Calculated form factors are applied to compute decay widths, branching ratios, and asymmetry parameters.

Result: Decay widths show approximate SU(3) symmetry; branching ratios for Ω_b decays align with other collaborations. Lepton universality ratios and asymmetry parameters provide clues for probing new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Conclusion: The results offer valuable references for theoretical and experimental studies on heavy baryon weak decays, supporting SU(3) symmetry analysis and highlighting avenues for exploring beyond-Standard-Model physics through asymmetries and universality ratios.

Abstract: In this article, the electroweak transition form factors of $Σ_b\toΣ_c$, $Ξ'_b\toΞ'_c$ and $Ω_b\toΩ_c$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered, and the Dirac structure dependence on the form factors is systematically eliminated. In QCD side, our calculation incorporates both the perturbative part and the contributions from vacuum condensates up to dimension 8. This systematic inclusion of higher-dimensional terms accounts for a broader set of Feynman diagrams, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and reliability of the operator product expansion. Using the obtained form factors, we study the partial widths of semileptonic decays $Σ_b\toΣ_cl\barν_l$, $Ξ'_b\toΞ'_cl\barν_l$ and $Ω_b\toΩ_cl\barν_l$ ($l=e$, $μ$ and $τ$). The results indicate that these decay widths approximately satisfy SU(3) flavor symmetry. Next, we calculate the branching ratios for the decay process $Ω_b\toΩ_cl\barν_l$ and compare them with the results from other collaborations. Furthermore, the lepton universality ratios and some asymmetry parameters of these decay processes are also analyzed, which provide information for the study of new physics. We hope that these results will serve as a useful reference for future theoretical and experimental studies of weak decays involving heavy flavor baryons.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies the semileptonic decay Ξ_b^0 → Ξ_c^+ℓν using a phenomenological quark model and HQET. They calculated form factors and decay rates, comparing with previous studies and finding agreement. LFU ratio R(Ξ_c) is ~0.3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the Standard Model and extract CKM matrix elements by analyzing heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decays, focusing on bottom-to-charm transitions.

Method: Computed baryon masses to derive wave functions, applied HQET up to 1/m_Q for form factors, used helicity formalism to calculate decay rates and branching ratios.

Result: Form factors agree with prior studies at maximum/minimum recoil; f1 and g1 dominate with similar q² dependence. Observed increasing form factor magnitude with q². Calculated R(Ξ_c) ~0.3, aligning with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The results support SM consistency and provide reliable form factors and LFU ratio, contributing to CKM matrix element determinations.

Abstract: Heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decays, particularly the bottom-to-charm quark transitions are essential for testing the Standard Model (SM) and extracting the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements. These decays have been extensively studied using various theoretical approaches. In this work, we investigate the semileptonic decay $Ξ_b^0 \rightarrow Ξ_c^+\ell\barν$ (where $\ell = e$, $τ$) using a phenomenological quark model. We compute the ground-state masses of the initial and final baryons to get the wave function. Which is then used to calculate the form factors, including corrections up to order $1/m_Q$ within the framework of Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). The obtained form factors are implemented in the helicity formalism to evaluate the differential decay rates, total decay width and branching ratio. We compare our results for the form factors at both the maximum and minimum recoil points with previous theoretical studies, finding good agreement. We observe that the form factors depend on the transferred momentum $q^2$ and their magnitude gradually increases with increasing $q^2$. The dominant form factors are $f_1$ and $g_1$ and they also exhibit similar $q^2$ dependencies. Additionally, we calculate the lepton flavour universality (LFU) ratio $R(Ξ_c) \approx 0.3$, which is in agreement with existing theoretical predictions.

*Marco Klann,Sven-Olaf Moch,Kay Schönwald*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates Mellin moments for heavy-quark structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering at next-to-leading order QCD, maintaining full mass dependence. Analytic results for N=2 to 22 moments of F₂ and F_L are derived using optical theorem and OPE, validated against asymptotic limits (Q² >> m²) and existing NLO coefficient functions. The methodology establishes a foundation for NNLO extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend precision calculations in QCD to better understand heavy-quark contributions in deep-inelastic scattering experiments. Validate theory against asymptotic behavior and existing approximations while preparing computational tools for higher-order calculations.

Method: Use optical theorem and operator product expansion (OPE) to compute Mellin moments of F₂ and F_L structure functions at NLO. Calculate moments from N=2 up to N=22 with full heavy-quark mass dependence. Cross-check results with known limits (Q² >> m²) and existing NLO parametrisations.

Result: Derived analytic expressions for Mellin moments N=2-22 of F₂ and F_L. Confirmed consistency with asymptotic limit (large Q²) and agreement with existing NLO coefficient functions. Computational framework enables future NNLO calculations.

Conclusion: The method successfully computes precise NLO corrections for heavy-quark structure functions. The results reinforce QCD predictions in both massless and massive regimes, and the developed computational tools are pivotal for advancing to NNLO precision in future studies.

Abstract: We compute Mellin moments of the heavy-quark structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering at next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics, retaining their full dependence on the heavy-quark mass. Using the optical theorem and the operator product expansion, we derive analytic results for fixed Mellin moments $N = 2$ to $22$ of the structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$. Our results reproduce the known expressions in the relevant asymptotic limits, in particular for virtualities of the exchanged photon $Q^2$ much larger than the heavy-quark mass squared $m^2$, and are in agreement with existing parametrisations of the next-to-leading-order coefficient functions. The computational set-up developed in this work also provides a direct pathway toward extending these calculations to next-to-next-to-leading order.

### [27] [The EP Model and its Completion Terms (E4)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04501)
*J. A. Dixon*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a simple Exotic Invariant model with two chiral electron supermultiplets (E and P), including a mass term subject to a solvable constraint. It proposes a conjecture for Completion Terms, demonstrating the model's utility in understanding the more complex Exotic Model derived from the Supersymmetric Standard Model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a simplified framework for analyzing the Exotic Model, which is an extension of the Supersymmetric Standard Model, by studying a basic example that maintains key features like constraints and Completion Terms.

Method: The authors construct a model with two chiral supermultiplets (E and P), introduce a mass term leading to a constraint, solve the constraint for this simple case, and propose a conjecture for the form of Completion Terms. They compare this model to a more complex Exotic Model based on E6, highlighting similarities.

Result: The model successfully illustrates how constraints and Completion Terms function in a simplified setting, showing that solutions for the Exotic Model in E6 are analogous. This simplifies the analysis of the more complicated Exotic Model.

Conclusion: The EP model serves as an essential tool for understanding the structure and behavior of the Exotic Model, proving that insights from simpler systems can clarify complex extensions of the Supersymmetric Standard Model.

Abstract: Here we present the simple example of an Exotic Invariant with just two chiral electron supermultiplets E and P. In this example we include a mass term, and that means that there is a constraint on the Exotic Invariant. The constraint is easily solved for this simple case. Here we also exhibit a simple conjecture for the Completion Terms. This simple example is very useful, because the constraint that arises in the case of the Exotic Model, presented in E6, is just as easy to solve, and the Completion Terms there are also very similar to those here. So this simple EP model is very useful for understanding the Exotic Model, which is what results from adding an Exotic Invariant to the rather complicated Supersymmetric Standard Model.

*Esteban Chalbaud,Stefania De Curtis,Luigi Delle Rose,Atri Dey,Stefano Moretti,Antonio Onofre*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores detecting additional Higgs states (H₂ and H₃) in top-antitop quark pairs at the LHC using kinematic features, demonstrating superiority over exclusive decay methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for discovering and characterizing extra Higgs bosons in the 2HDM without relying on their decay products, addressing complications in exclusive reconstruction.

Method: Analysis of tt̄ system kinematic properties in gg,q̄q→tt̄Φ processes, using CP-conserving 2HDM framework. Correlates H₂/H₃ masses with tt̄ observables and determines their CP properties.

Result: Shows clear mass-observable correlations and successful CP property determination even with simultaneous H₂/H₃ production. Method outperforms traditional b̄b decay channel reconstruction for light Higgs states.

Conclusion: Proposed approach enables inclusive Higgs discovery in tt̄ pairs, avoiding exclusive reconstruction issues. Tested in Composite 2HDM (pNGB Higgs), proving viability for LHC sensitivity ranges.

Abstract: We study the possibility of establishing the production of additional Higgs states in the process $gg,q\bar q\to t\bar t Φ$, where $Φ$ = $H_{2,3}$, with $H_2$ being CP-even and $H_3$ being CP-odd, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), by solely exploiting the kinematic features of the reconstructed $t\bar t$ system. We adopt as reference theoretical framework a generic CP-Conserving 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), which also accommodate a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs state $H_1$. We show that the masses $m_{H_{2,3}}$ exhibit clear correlations with the $t\bar{t}$ system properties and could, in principle, be extracted from these. Moreover, the CP properties of the $H_{2,3}$ states can be determined, even when both states are produced simultaneously. We then compare the results produced using this method with those obtained from a full kinematic reconstruction of the $H_{2,3}$ decays in the most studied $b\bar b$ channel (we take $m_{H_{2,3}}< 2m_t$), thus proving the superiority of the approach here proposed. This paves the way to both the discovery and characterization of additional Higgs states produced {\sl inclusively} in association with top-antitop quark pairs, thereby dispensing of the complications intrinsic to the {\sl exclusive} reconstruction of such states from their decay products. We test this by establishing the sensitivity of our approach in the case of a Composite 2HDM (C2HDM), describing the Higges as pseudo-Nambu Goldstone Bosons (pNGBs) and naturally predicting Higgs mass spectra in the range of sensitivity of the described analysis.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study uses Fierz rearrangement to analyze glueball decay properties, predicting significant gluon components in f_0(1710) and η(2370), but not f_0(1500), and proposes experimental channels for three-gluon glueball detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the gluonic structure of exotic hadrons and determine branching ratios of glueballs in a model-independent way, aiding future experimental searches.

Method: Application of Fierz rearrangement based on hadron symmetry properties to calculate relative branching ratios for two- and three-gluon glueballs with specific quantum numbers.

Result: Derived ~100 branching ratios, identifying significant gluon components in f_0(1710) and η(2370), minimal gluon content in f_0(1500), and proposed detection channels for three-gluon glueballs.

Conclusion: Enhances understanding of gluonic hadron structures and provides experimental guidance for high-energy physics searches of specific glueball states.

Abstract: The Fierz rearrangement, based on the various internal symmetries of hadrons, can be used to study their decay properties in a largely model-independent way. In this Letter we apply this method to calculate the relative branching ratios of two-gluon glueballs with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}/0^{-+}$ and three-gluon glueballs with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}/1^{+-}$. In total, we derive nearly one hundred ratios for these glueballs. Our results suggest that the $f_0(1710)$ and $η(2370)$ likely contain a significant gluon component, whereas the gluon component in $f_0(1500)$ appears to be small. Furthermore, we propose observing the three-gluon glueball with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ in the $ππω$ and $K\bar{K}φ$ channels, and the three-gluon glueball with $J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$ in the $ππω$, $ππφ$, and $K\bar{K}φ$ channels. This study enhances our understanding of the gluonic structure of exotic hadrons and will assist future experimental searches in high-energy physics.

### [30] [Fluctuation-Induced Friction in Bubble-Wall Dynamics of Cosmological First-Order Phase Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04586)
*Dongdong Wei,Zong-Kuan Guo*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates bubble-wall dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions using a two-scalar-field model, showing how coupled scalar fields and initial fluctuations influence wall motion, propagation profiles, and implications for gravitational wave and baryogenesis predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how coupled scalar fields affect bubble wall dynamics in phase transitions, which impacts cosmological predictions like gravitational waves and baryogenesis.

Method: The authors use lattice simulations of coupled classical field equations in a two-scalar-field model, starting with a Bose-Einstein distributed $s$ field at nucleation temperature. They analyze the resulting wall behavior and propagation regimes.

Result: The wall exhibits accelerating/decelerating phases leading to a slower average speed. Three propagation profiles (deflagration, detonation, hybrid) are identified based on energy density distribution relative to the wall.

Conclusion: Dynamic scalar field couplings significantly alter bubble wall dynamics, offering new insights for gravitational wave signatures and baryogenesis mechanisms.

Abstract: We study bubble-wall dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions in a two-scalar-field model, where the wall is formed by $φ$ and an additional real scalar $s$ couples through a portal interaction. We evolve the coupled classical field equations on the lattice and demonstrate that for an initial Bose--Einstein distribution of $s$ fluctuations at the nucleation temperature $T_n$, the resulting patchy background intermittently modulates the local driving pressure on the wall. The wall therefore undergoes alternating episodes of acceleration and deceleration and approaches a quasi-stationary propagation regime with a smaller time-averaged speed than in the decoupled limit. We further identify three familiar propagation profiles -- deflagration, detonation, and hybrid -- distinguished by where the dynamical $s$-sector energy density is concentrated relative to the wall. These effects can impact gravitational wave and baryogenesis predictions.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates power corrections in Drell-Yan processes for both neutral and charged current production, considering bottom and charm quark effects using a variable flavor number scheme. Significant corrections were found at low-Q regions, with careful matching to avoid double counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately account for power corrections in Drell-Yan processes, especially addressing the impact of heavy quarks (bottom and charm) and ensuring proper treatment of overlapping contributions in low-Q regions.

Method: State-of-the-art predictions for neutral and charged current Drell-Yan processes under a variable flavor number scheme, incorporating power corrections from bottom and charm quarks, and applying rigorous matching procedures to eliminate double counting.

Result: Power corrections from heavy quarks become significant in the low-Q region, and the applied matching procedures successfully prevent double counting in overlapping contributions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the necessity of including heavy quark power corrections in low-Q Drell-Yan analyses and validates the effectiveness of the variable flavor number scheme with proper matching for precise predictions.

Abstract: We study power corrections in the Drell-Yan (DY) process using state-of-the-art predictions for both neutral and charged current production. For both types of DY processes, we account for power corrections arising from bottom and charm quark effects within a variable flavor number scheme. Our results show that these corrections become significant in the low-$Q$ region. We also ensure proper treatment of overlapping contributions by carefully applying matching procedures to eliminate any double counting.

### [32] [Relativistic and Recoil Corrections to Light-Fermion Vacuum Polarization for Bound Systems of Spin-0, Spin-1/2, and Spin-1 Particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04743)
*G. S. Adkins,U. D. Jentschura*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper generalizes the treatment of radiative corrections from electronic vacuum polarization to bound systems with constituents of various spins (spin-0, 1/2, 1), applying results to systems like pionium, muonic hydrogen/deuterium, and excited non-S deuteronium states, yielding energy corrections of order α⁵m_r.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous work on radiative corrections for muonic systems to a broader range of spin configurations, addressing the need for precise calculations in systems where electronic vacuum polarization dominates energy level corrections.

Method: Generalized formalism accounting for relativistic and recoil effects in vacuum polarization, applicable to spin-0, spin-1/2, and spin-1 bound systems. Derived expressions are applied to specific systems like pionium and deuteronium.

Result: Calculated energy corrections of order α⁵m_r for various systems, with particular analysis of excited non-S states in deuteronium where higher-order effects are significant.

Conclusion: The generalized approach provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating radiative corrections in diverse bound systems, enhancing precision in atomic and nuclear physics experiments.

Abstract: In bound systems whose constituent particles are heavier than the electron, the dominant radiative correction to energy levels is given by light-fermion (electronic) vacuum polarization. In consequence, relativistic and recoil corrections to the one-loop vacuum-polarization correction are phenomenologically relevant. Here, we generalize the treatment, previously accomplished for systems with orbiting muons, to bound systems of constituents with more general spins: spin-0, spin-1/2, and spin-1. We discuss the application of our more general expressions to various systems of interest, including spinless systems (pionium), muonic hydrogen and deuterium, and devote special attention to the excited non-S states of deuteronium, the bound system of a deuteron and its antiparticle. The obtained energy corrections are of order alpha^5*m_r, where alpha is the fine-structure constant and m_r is the reduced mass.

### [33] [Near-Resonant Thermal Leptogenesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04772)
*Angus Spalding*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates near-resonant thermal leptogenesis, showing it can generate the observed baryon asymmetry at electroweak scale masses (~100 GeV) without relying on resonant conditions or non-thermal production, expanding viable parameter space down to low reheating temperatures (~10 GeV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative leptogenesis mechanisms that avoid the high mass requirements of standard thermal leptogenesis and the regulatory issues of resonant models while enabling lower-scale realizations compatible with observational constraints.

Method: Derive CP asymmetry expansion near mass degeneracy with ΔM >> Γ_i, analyze vanilla/flavoured near-resonant scenarios, assess reheating impacts, and formulate a flavour-inclusive framework for leptogenesis during reheating.

Result: Universal upper bound ε ≤1/200 independent of neutrino masses/right-handed masses; successful asymmetry generation for M ≥100 GeV across washout regimes; compatibility with TRH ~10 GeV without non-thermal production.

Conclusion: Near-resonant thermal leptogenesis provides a viable, low-scale alternative to standard and resonant models, offering a regulator-free pathway to electroweak-scale baryogenesis validated in both vanilla and flavoured scenarios.

Abstract: We study leptogenesis in the quasi-degenerate but non-resonant regime. Expanding the CP asymmetry parameter near degeneracy and imposing the conservative non-resonance condition that the mass splitting must be much greater than the right-handed neutrino decay rates $ΔM > 100Γ_i$, yields the universal upper bound $ε\leq 1/200$, independent of both the effective neutrino masses and the right-handed neutrino mass. We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \gtrsim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T_{RH}\simeq 10\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis.

*Adikiran Johny,Athulkrishna R,Rudra Majhi,Suchismita Sahoo*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates how DUNE can use quantum entanglement measures to study neutrino oscillations from a Galactic core-collapse supernova, demonstrating the potential for determining the neutrino mass ordering with high sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of quantum entanglement as a framework for analyzing neutrino flavor conversion in supernovae, and to assess DUNE's capability to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy through such measurements.

Method: The study models neutrino flavor states as multipartite quantum systems, quantifies entanglement via measures like concurrence and negativity, simulates event rates using SNOwGLoBES with Garching flux models, and evaluates mass ordering sensitivity across detection channels.

Result: DUNE achieves 5σ mass ordering determination at ~20 kpc for νe and ~2 kpc forν_ē channels, with results dependent on entanglement scenarios. Entanglement-based observables offer a robust complementary approach.

Conclusion: Quantum entanglement provides a powerful tool for probing supernova neutrino physics, enhancing DUNE's ability to resolve neutrino oscillation properties and mass ordering with greater sensitivity than previously possible.

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) offers strong sensitivity to neutrinos from a Galactic core collapse supernova, providing a powerful probe of neutrino flavor conversion and the neutrino mass ordering. In this work, we study supernova neutrino oscillations at DUNE using quantum entanglement as an organizing framework. Treating the three flavor neutrino system as an effective multipartite quantum state, we quantify flavor correlations through the entanglement of formation, concurrence, and negativity, expressed directly in terms of flavor survival and transition probabilities. Benchmark scenarios defined by representative variations of the electron neutrino survival probability are constructed for each entanglement measure. Event rates and fluences are computed for a supernova at 10 kpc, and the mass ordering sensitivity is evaluated using detector-level simulations performed with the \texttt{SNOwGLoBES} framework, employing the Garching supernova flux model and including the dominant detection channels in liquid argon: $ν_e$ and $\barν_e$ charged-current interactions on argon and elastic scattering on electrons. We analyze both individual and combined detection channels and incorporate $5\%$ normalization and energy calibration systematic uncertainties. Our results show that DUNE achieves a $5σ$ determination of the neutrino mass ordering for a supernova at distances of $\sim 20$~kpc for the $ν_e$ charged current channel and $\sim 2$~kpc for the $\barν_e$ channel, with the reach depending on the entanglement scenario considered. These results demonstrate that entanglement based observables provide a complementary and robust framework for probing supernova neutrino oscillations and the neutrino mass ordering.

### [35] [Primordial black holes as cosmic accelerators of light dark matter: Novel direct detection constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04858)
*Sk Jeesun,Anirban Majumdar,Rahul Srivastava*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to detect light dark matter particles via their electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments by considering their production from evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs), accounting for different interaction types and Earth crust attenuation, and setting constraints using data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detectors struggle to detect light dark matter due to energy thresholds. PBH evaporation provides a pathway for light dark matter particles to reach detectable energies, enabling terrestrial probes of the light dark sector.

Method: Analyzes fermionic DM produced by PBH evaporation, models electron recoil signals under constant, scalar, and vector-mediated DM-electron interactions, incorporates Earth crust-induced flux attenuation, and applies constraints using experimental data.

Result: Derives constraints on light DM parameters using XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T data, showing sensitivity dependence on interaction type and Earth attenuation. Discusses detection potential in future neutrino detectors.

Conclusion: PBH-evaporated light DM can be probed via electron recoils, with detection prospects enhanced by considering Lorentz structure and attenuation effects. Future experiments like Hyper Kamiokande may significantly improve this approach.

Abstract: Current multiton dark matter (DM) detectors are largely incapable of detecting light dark matter from the Galactic halo due to the energy threshold limitations of their recoil measurements. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study evaluates thermal conductivity of various carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials at ultra-cold temperatures (100 mK to 20 K) using a new analysis method, comparing their performance across fiber types, layouts, and densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different CFRP materials behave thermally under cryogenic conditions, ensuring optimal material selection for spacecraft and aerospace tools which require high strength, low weight, and minimal thermal conductivity.

Method: Researchers measured thermal conductivity of T300, T700, HS40, M55J, and IMA carbon fiber samples under varying fiber layouts and densities at temperatures from 100 mK to 20 K. A novel analysis method was employed for calculating thermal conductivity.

Result: The study provides detailed thermal conductivity data for each material under tested conditions, highlighting material-specific behaviors and comparisons with prior research findings.

Conclusion: The findings advance cryogenic thermal management material selection, validating the new analysis method and offering insights for aerospace applications requiring stable performance at ultra-low temperatures.

Abstract: Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are some of the most useful materials for building spacecraft and aerospace tools. They are especially valuable for systems that work at extremely cold (cryogenic) temperatures because they are strong, lightweight, and don't transfer heat easily.
  In this study, researchers measured how well heat moves through several different types of carbon fiber samples, specifically T300, T700, HS40, M55J, and IMA, at different fiber layouts and densities. These measurements were taken at ultra-cold temperatures ranging from 100 mK to 20 K. The team used a newly developed analysis method to calculate the thermal conductivity for each sample. Finally, they shared how each material behaved at different temperatures and compared their findings to previous research.

*Anne O'Connor,Varun Bajaj,Jennifer Mack,Annalisa Calamida*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study analyzes the geometric distortion of Hubble's WFC3/UVIS instrument using Gaia data from 2009 to 2022, finding minor linear term changes (scale/skew <0.2 pixels over 13 years) dominated by intrinsic scatter. Filter-dependent scale offsets (up to 0.3 pixels) and rotation shifts (up to 0.01 degrees) are noted. Recommendations include MAST's alignment step and specific tweakreg parameter fits for high-precision astrometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess temporal variations in WFC3/UVIS geometric distortions to improve astrometric calibration and processing accuracy, ensuring reliable long-term use of Hubble data.

Method: Aligned 7,400 WFC3 UVIS exposures with Gaia DR3; measured linear terms (shift, rotation, scale, skew) over time; analyzed filter-dependent effects and rotation offsets; evaluated MAST pipeline corrections using source-matching thresholds.

Result: Observed minor (<0.2 pixels) temporal scale/skew changes with scatter dominating; filter-scale differences (0.3 pixels max between F275W/F814W); rotation offsets increasing post-2017; confirmed MAST pipeline's alignment step effectiveness with ≥10 sources.

Conclusion: MAST's alignment step corrects linear distortion evolution when sufficient sources exist. Observers should apply tweakreg with 4/6-parameter fits based on matched sources for high-precision astrometry, as detailed in DrizzlePac tutorials.

Abstract: We align more than 7,400 WFC3/UVIS exposures to the Gaia DR3 catalog to examine the time evolution of the linear terms (shift, rotation, scale and skew) of the geometric distortion solution between 2009 and 2022. We find small linear temporal changes in the scale and skew terms (less than 0.2 pixels in 13 years) which are generally dominated by intrinsic scatter (up to $\pm$ 0.3 pixels). Concurrently, a larger filter-dependent offset in the scale term is observed, with a maximum difference of 0.3 pixels between F275W and F814W images at all epochs. A small rotation offset to Gaia of 0.003 $\pm$ 0.004 degrees is measured from 2009 to mid-2017, after which the offsets are as large as 0.01 degrees, with a large scatter. MAST pipeline processing includes an additional alignment step which corrects UVIS images for any residual linear terms with respect to Gaia DR3 when there are at least 10 matched sources. In addition to any pointing offsets, this step accounts for any evolution in the distortion linear terms described here. For observers requiring high-precision astrometry, we recommend using the tweakreg routine to realign images using a 4-parameter fit (x-shift, y-shift, rotation, and scale) or a 6-parameter fit (x-shift, y-shift, x-rotation, y-rotation, x-scale, and y-scale) depending on the number of matched sources. We provide links to DrizzlePac tutorials for improving both absolute and relative astrometry in WFC3 images.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum computing framework to process VLBI data more efficiently using quantum algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational limitations in traditional VLBI data correlation methods by leveraging quantum computing's reduced complexity.

Method: Embeds classical VLBI data into a quantum superposition via amplitude encoding, implements quantum versions of correlation operations (fringe rotation, Fourier transform, etc.), and validates against classical methods.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility and accuracy of the quantum pipeline, though data encoding remains a challenge. Quantum methods show promise despite state preparation complexities.

Conclusion: Quantum computing is a promising paradigm for future VLBI systems due to its potential to reduce computational demands, especially with quantized VLBI data aiding state preparation.

Abstract: We present a quantum computing framework for VLBI data correlation. We point out that a classical baseband time series data of length $N$ can be embedded into a quantum superposition state using amplitude encoding with only $\log_2 N$ qubits. The basic VLBI correlation and fringe fitting operations, including fringe rotation, Fourier transform, delay compensation, and cross correlation, can be implemented via quantum algorithms with significantly reduced computational complexity. We construct a full quantum processing pipeline and validate its feasibility and accuracy through direct comparison with a classical VLBI pipeline. We recognize that amplitude encoding of large data volumes remains the primary bottleneck in quantum computing; however, the quantized nature of VLBI raw data helps reduce the state-preparation complexity. Our investigation demonstrates that quantum computation offers a promising paradigm for VLBI data correlation and is likely to play a role in future VLBI systems.
