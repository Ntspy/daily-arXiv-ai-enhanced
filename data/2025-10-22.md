Abstract: We investigate the interactions of the deuteron with light mesons during the
hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions. We treat the deuteron as a weakly bound
state and employ the quasi-free approximation to describe the $d\pi$
interaction. The underlying elementary $N\pi$ amplitudes are described by a
hybrid effective model, combining the non-resonant background from chiral
perturbation theory with resonant contributions via Breit-Wigner
parameterizations. These amplitudes are used to calculate the vacuum and
thermally-averaged cross-sections for deuteron dissociation and production,
namely, $d + \pi \rightarrow N + N' + \pi$ and the corresponding inverse
reaction. We then use these cross sections in a rate equation to estimate the
time evolution of the deuteron multiplicity. For the initial conditions we
consider two models: the statistical hadronization model and the coalescence
model, where the deuteron is treated as a hadronic molecule. Our findings
suggest that the final deuteron yield does not retain a memory of its initial
production mechanism.

### [2] [Branching ratios for Higgs-mixed scalars at the GeV scale from hadronisation models with conservation laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17961)
*Stefan Gieseke,Felix Kahlhoefer,Henry Seebach*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the decay modes of a CP-even scalar boson mixed with the Standard Model Higgs in the mass range 2 GeV to 2m_τ. Using a modified hadronisation model, they predict two-particle hadronic states (e.g., π+π−, K+K−) dominate over μ+μ− near 2 GeV, highlighting promising experimental search targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand decay patterns of a Higgs-like scalar boson in the low-mass range, which is crucial for identifying potential new physics beyond the Standard Model and guiding experimental detection strategies.

Method: The authors performed a higher-order perturbative calculation for inclusive decays ϕ→gg and ϕ→sUsuarios, then applied a modified Herwig cluster-based hadronisation model accounting for conservation laws. Two parameters were tuned using dispersion relations at m_ϕ=2 GeV to extrapolate results to higher masses.

Result: Predictions show π+π− and K+K− final states dominate over μ+μ− at masses near 2 GeV. This provides measurable signatures for experimental searches in this mass range.

Conclusion: The study establishes a reliable framework for predicting hadronic decay channels of mixed Higgs scalars in the sub-2m_τ region. The identified two-body hadronic modes offer experimentally viable targets to test scalar boson hypotheses in particle colliders.

Abstract: We investigate the decay modes of a CP-even scalar boson $\phi$ that mixes
with the Standard Model Higgs boson, focusing on the mass range between 2 GeV
and $2 m_\tau$. Starting from a higher-order perturbative calculation of the
inclusive decays $\phi \to gg$ and $\phi \to s\bar{s}$, we employ a
hadronisation model to obtain predictions for individual hadronic final states.
Our hadronisation model is based on the Herwig cluster model, but incorporates
various conservation laws to determine the allowed final states and their
respective weights. The model includes two tunable parameters, which we
determine using dispersion relation results at $m_\phi = 2$ GeV, enabling
extrapolation to higher masses. Our predictions show that two-particle hadronic
final states like $\pi^+ \pi^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ dominate over $\mu^+ \mu^-$ for
$m_\phi$ near 2 GeV, suggesting promising targets for future experimental
searches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes play a prominent role in the
search for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) due to their sensitivity to
new physics at the TeV scale. Meson-antimeson transitions and rare meson decays
provide stringent constraints on new physics through precision measurements of
observables such as mass differences, CP asymmetries, and branching ratios.
Extensions of the SM based on the $\text{SU}(3)_C \times \text{SU}(3)_L \times
\text{U}(1)_N$ gauge group offer a compelling framework for flavor physics, as
FCNC processes emerge inexorably at tree level due to the non-universal
transformations of the quark families. Among its various realizations, the
version incorporating right-handed neutrinos (331RHN) is the most
phenomenologically viable. This review synthesizes three decades of theoretical
developments in FCNC phenomenology within the 331RHN model, from early
$Z^\prime$-dominated studies to the recent recognition of the decisive role
played by the SM-like Higgs boson and the identification of the alignment
limit. We demonstrate that viable parameter space spans orders of magnitude,
from $m_{Z^\prime} \sim$ a few hundred GeV to $\sim 100$ TeV, depending
critically on quark mixing parametrizations and scalar alignment
configurations, with significant implications for experimental searches at
current and future colliders.

### [4] [QINNs: Quantum-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17984)
*Aritra Bal,Markus Klute,Benedikt Maier,Melik Oughton,Eric Pezone,Michael Spannowsky*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces QINNs, which integrate quantum information concepts like qubits and the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) into classical deep learning models for collider data analysis. Applied to jet tagging, QINNs enhance model expressiveness and interpretability by encoding particles as qubits and using QFIM as a summary of correlations, showing promising results aligned with physical expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical neural networks, while effective, lack physics-based inductive biases. The authors aim to incorporate quantum mechanics principles to improve model interpretability, expressiveness, and alignment with physical expectations in particle physics analysis.

Method: The proposed method, QINNs, encodes each particle as a qubit. It uses the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) to capture particle correlations in a basis-independent manner. QFIMs are then used as lightweight embeddings within graph neural networks for tasks like jet tagging.

Result: QINNs demonstrate distinct patterns between QCD and top jets consistent with physical theories. The approach increases model plasticity and expressivity while maintaining scalability, offering a practical, interpretable method for analyzing particle collisions.

Conclusion: QINNs provide a scalable and interpretable framework for quantum-informed analysis in particle physics. By enhancing classical models with quantum concepts, the method shows potential for improving established deep learning approaches in collider data analysis.

Abstract: Classical deep neural networks can learn rich multi-particle correlations in
collider data, but their inductive biases are rarely anchored in physics
structure. We propose quantum-informed neural networks (QINNs), a general
framework that brings quantum information concepts and quantum observables into
purely classical models. While the framework is broad, in this paper, we study
one concrete realisation that encodes each particle as a qubit and uses the
Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) as a compact, basis-independent
summary of particle correlations. Using jet tagging as a case study, QFIMs act
as lightweight embeddings in graph neural networks, increasing model
expressivity and plasticity. The QFIM reveals distinct patterns for QCD and
hadronic top jets that align with physical expectations. Thus, QINNs offer a
practical, interpretable, and scalable route to quantum-informed analyses, that
is, tomography, of particle collisions, particularly by enhancing
well-established deep learning approaches.

### [5] [Collider Searches for Near-Continuum Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17989)
*Steven Ferrante,Lillian Luo,Maxim Perelstein,Taewook Youn*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes collider constraints on a near-continuum dark matter model using a minimal parameterization, simulates DM production/decays at the LHC, and projects future collider sensitivities, showing future electron-positron colliders outperform HL-LHC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the viability of the near-continuum dark matter model with closely spaced dark sector states coupled via a Z-portal, and assess current and future collider experiments' ability to constrain or probe this model.

Method: Introduced a 3-parameter model encoding the dark sector's geometric properties. Simulated 13 TeV LHC DM pair production with custom MC tools, considering Z-mediated decays. Recast CMS multijet+missing transverse energy analysis for Run-2 data. Projected HL-LHC (3 ab⁻¹) and future electron-positron collider (365/500 GeV) sensitivities.

Result: Current LHC data starts approaching the theoretically favored parameter space. Future colliders (especially electron-positron at 365/500 GeV) show significantly better sensitivity than HL-LHC.

Conclusion: Collider experiments are beginning to probe the near-continuum dark matter model, with future machines like electron-positron colliders providing transformative testing capabilities beyond current LHC limits.

Abstract: We study collider constraints on the near-continuum dark matter model, in
which the dark sector consists of a tower of closely spaced states with
weak-scale masses coupled to the Standard Model through a $Z$-portal. To
capture this structure in a model-agnostic way, we introduce a minimal
parameterization that encodes the dominant geometric information with three
parameters. Using a custom-built Monte-Carlo tool for near-continuous spectra,
we simulate DM-pair production at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and subsequent cascade
decays via on/off-shell $Z$ bosons, which yield events with large missing
transverse momentum and high jet multiplicity. Recasting the CMS
multijet$+H_T^{\rm miss}$ analysis of Run-2 data (35.9 fb$^{-1}$), we derive
bounds on the model parameter space. Extrapolating these bounds, we provide
High-Luminosity LHC projections (3 ab$^{-1}$). We also project sensitivities
for future electron-positron colliders at $\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV and $\sqrt{s}=500$
GeV, showing substantial improvements over the HL-LHC. The current LHC
sensitivity is beginning to approach the theoretically motivated region of the
parameter space, while future colliders will be able to comprehensively test
this model.

### [6] [Systematic derivation of perturbative unitarity bounds for any models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17997)
*Nico Benincasa*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces anyPUB, a general algorithm to compute 2→2 scattering matrices in the high-energy limit for any model, followed by unitarity analysis. It applies this to the minimal left-right symmetric and Pati-Salam models, deriving new unitarity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic and universal method for analyzing high-energy scattering processes and perturbative unitarity across different particle physics models, addressing the need for model-independent analysis tools.

Method: The proposed algorithm 'anyPUB' constructs scattering matrices analytically/numerically, calculates eigenvalues, and applies unitarity bounds. Validated through comparison with existing literature.

Result: Successful validation against literature; first derivation of unitarity constraints in the less-explored Pati-Salam model using their method.

Conclusion: anyPUB provides a versatile framework for unitarity analysis in various models, enabling new explorations in beyond Standard Model physics like left-right symmetric and Pati-Salam models.

Abstract: In this letter, we provide a simple algorithm, anyPUB, to systematically
derive the $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering matrix in the high-energy limit for any
kind of models, irrespective of their gauge group or their field
representation. After computing the eigenvalues analytically and/or numerically
from this matrix, we impose perturbative unitarity bounds on them. We tested
our method on various models and validated the results against the literature.
Finally, as a concrete application of our approach, we discuss the case of the
minimal left-right symmetric model and derive, for the first time, the
perturbative unitarity constraints in the Pati-Salam model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The scattering of dark matter particles within the Sun's hot plasma can lead
to acceleration of dark matter, producing a high-energy solar-reflected DM flux
detectable in ground-based experiments. In the vector portal model,
interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles are mediated by a
hidden vector field--referred to as ``dark photon"--which kinetically mixes
with the conventional photon through a small mixing angle. Furthermore, the
solar plasma generates intense magnetic fields. Due to the photon-dark photon
mixing, this simultaneously sources a ``dark magnetic field". For sufficiently
low dark photon masses, this dark magnetic field is capable of deflecting dark
matter particles traversing the Sun. We found that if the dark magnetic force
is sufficiently strong, the dark magnetic field becomes a wall, preventing the
dark matter particles from reaching the deep core region, suppressing their
reflected flux. This scenario correct the sensitivity of solar-reflected dark
matter detection, offering critical insights for ground-based experiments
aiming to probe dark matter.

### [8] [Theoretical Aspects of $b \to s \bar{\ell}\ell$ Decays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18138)
*Arianna Tinari*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether charm rescattering contributions in $B^0 	o K^0 ar{	au}	au$ decays can explain the 20% $C_9$ shift seen in $b 	o s ar{	au}	au$ anomalies. Using a hadronic model, they find that while extreme fine-tuning allows up to 20% shifts, natural scenarios only produce 5% shifts, favoring new physics explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observed deviations in $b 	o s ar{	au}	au$ decays between SM predictions and experiments could be due to a 20% shift in $C_9$. The authors aim to determine if this shift originates from charm rescattering (long-distance effects) instead of new physics.

Method: The study uses a hadronic model based on heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory, incorporating form factors and experimental data to simulate charm rescattering contributions in $B^0 	o K^0 ar{	au}	au$ decays. They analyze $q^2$ dependence and compare with experimental data.

Result: The analysis shows that achieving a 20% $C_9$ shift requires unnatural fine-tuning, leading to a pronounced $q^2$ dependence contrary to experimental consistency. In natural scenarios, shifts are only ~5%, suggesting new physics is more plausible.

Conclusion: Charm rescattering is unlikely to fully explain the $C_9$ anomaly without excessive fine-tuning. The $b 	o s ar{	au}	au$ modes retain strong potential for new physics discovery, emphasizing the need for higher precision experiments.

Abstract: Flavor-changing neutral current decays such as $b \to s \bar{\ell} \ell$ are
highly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) and therefore provide sensitive
tests for new physics. Persistent tensions between SM predictions and
experimental results in branching ratios and angular observables can be
explained by a shift of the Wilson coefficient $C_9$ of the effective operator
$O_9$ by $\sim 20 \%$ relative to the SM value. This shift could arise from a
non-standard short-distance contribution or from an inaccurate description of
long-distance dynamics, particularly charm rescattering contributions. We
therefore investigate charm rescattering contributions in $B^0 \to K^0
\bar{\ell}\ell$ using a model of fundamental hadronic degrees of freedom
inspired by heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory and improved by appropriate
form factors as well as experimental data. Our analysis shows that such
effects, with a high degree of fine-tuning, could shift $C_9$ by $\sim 20\%$,
at the cost of introducing a more pronounced $q^2$ dependence, whereas
experimental data are consistent with a $q^2$-independent shift of $C_9$ with
the current experimental uncertainties. In the most natural scenario, we find
these effects to be of the order of $\sim 5\%$. Connections with other flavor
anomalies further illustrate the strong discovery potential of $b \to s
\bar{\ell} \ell$ modes.

### [9] [Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter: From Phenomenology to Astrophysical Observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18142)
*M. Grant Roberts,Wolfgang Altmannshofer,Pierce Giffin,Stefano Profumo*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model with a dominant moderately self-interacting species and an ultra-strongly self-interacting subcomponent (uSIDM), constrained by galaxy and cluster observations. This model addresses cosmological structure formation challenges and high-redshift phenomena like quasars while maintaining consistency with diverse observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve tensions between cold dark matter predictions and galaxy-scale observations (e.g., core vs. cusp problems, missing satellites), while explaining high-redshift phenomena like early quasars and 'little red dots' through accelerated halo collapse.

Method: A framework using a vector mediator for velocity-dependent self-scattering, analytical relic abundance calculations via annihilation and interconversion processes. Model parameters are constrained using galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, direct detection limits, and mapped to ETHOS parameters. Linear power spectrum evolution in CLASS predicts observables.

Result: Identified viable parameter regions where (1) SIDM component has σ_eff/m within 20-40 cm²/g at dwarf velocities but below 0.13 cm²/g for clusters, (2) uSIDM subcomponent (<1%) drives early gravothermal collapse for high-redshift quasar seeds, and (3) power spectrum cutoff aligns with Lyman-α/satellite data but shows detectable non-standard features. Constraint reliance on mediator mass ratio and uSIDM fraction.

Conclusion: The two-component SIDM model offers a coherent solution to multiple astrophysical puzzles. Future observations (e.g., gravitational lensing, next-gen surveys) could distinguish its unique power spectrum features and validate its role in early structure formation.

Abstract: We develop a minimal, testable framework for two-component self-interacting
dark matter (SIDM) in which a dominant, moderately self-interacting species
coexists with an ultra-strongly self-interacting subcomponent (uSIDM). A light
vector mediator induces velocity-dependent self-scattering, while
early-universe dynamics - standard $2 \to 2$ annihilation supplemented by
interconversion $\chi_1\chi_1 \to \chi_2\chi_2$ - determine the relic abundance
analytically. From observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxy
rotation curves, as well as strong cluster lensing, we place constraints on the
microphysics parameters. From these constrained regions, we map the
microphysics to effective \texttt{ETHOS} parameters and evolve the linear power
spectrum in \texttt{CLASS}. We then confront the model with direct-detection
constraints and place an upper bound on our parameter space. We identify a
region where: (1) the SIDM dominant component attains $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m = 20
- 40~\text{cm}^{2}\text{g}^{-1}$ at dwarf velocities while satisfying cluster
upper bounds $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m < 0.13~\rm{cm}^{2}\rm{g}^{-1}$; (2) a
subpercent uSIDM fraction drives accelerated gravothermal collapse in early
halos, providing seeds relevant to high-redshift quasar formation and ``little
red dots''; and (3) the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum remains
consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ and satellite counts, but exhibits non-standard
features, potentially discernible with future observations. The allowed space
can be organized by the mediator-to-DM mass ratio and the late-time uSIDM
fraction, with a narrow window singled out by the combined cosmological and
astrophysical requirements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The neutrino dipole portal (NDP) is a minimal and predictive extension of the
Standard Model, in which a transition magnetic moment operator couples an
active neutrino to a heavy neutral lepton via the electromagnetic field. This
higher-dimensional interaction gives rise to distinctive processes such as
neutrino up-scattering, radiative decays, meson transitions, and modifications
of recoil spectra, offering multiple avenues for discovery. In this review, we
discuss the theoretical foundations of the NDP, its ultraviolet completions,
and the associated production and decay mechanisms across laboratory,
astrophysical, and cosmological settings. Current constraints arise from
accelerator searches, recoil-based detectors, collider studies, and high energy
neutrino observatories, complemented by robust bounds from Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and supernova cooling. Future
experimental and observational efforts, including next-generation neutrino
experiments, multi-ton dark matter detectors, and improved cosmological and
astrophysical probes, are anticipated to test the remaining allowed regions.
The NDP thus provides a simple, well-motivated, and broadly testable framework
at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.

### [11] [High-Quality Axion Models with the Anomalous $U(1)_X$ Gauge Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18306)
*Hongkun Gao,Tianjun Li,Lina Wu,Wenxing Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces three models based on an anomalous $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry with minimal vector-like particle content (two pairs) to solve the strong CP problem and axion quality issue. These models achieve high-quality axion decay constants via dimension-11+ operators, and Models I and II naturally include gauge coupling unification at ~1e16 GeV with minimal errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivations are to address the axion quality problem by suppressing dangerous high-dimensional PQ-symmetry breaking terms and to minimize the required vector-like particle content for gauge anomaly cancellation while achieving natural gauge coupling unification.

Method: The authors construct three models with anomalous $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry using the Green-Schwarz mechanism for anomaly cancellation, introducing only two vector-like particle pairs. They analyze $U(1)_X$ breaking, derive axion properties, and validate gauge coupling unification through additional vector-like particles in Model I. Model II uniquely achieves 0.1% unification precision without extra particles.

Result: All three models solve the axion quality problem with axion decay constants from dimension-11+ operators. Models I and II achieve gauge coupling unification at ~1e16 GeV with <1% error (0.1% for Model II). The minimal particle content (two vector-like pairs) addresses the simplicity concern in previous high-quality axion models.

Conclusion: These models efficiently resolve the strong CP problem and axion quality issue with fewer particles than prior approaches, demonstrating that gauge coupling unification can be naturally achieved even with minimal vector-like extensions. Model II stands out for its exceptional precision in unification without additional particles.

Abstract: We propose the generic high-quality axion models with anomalous $U(1)_X$
gauge symmetry and vector-like particles. We briefly review the gauge anomaly
cancellations via the Green-Schwarz mechanism, study the breaking of the
$U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, as well as derive the Nambu-Goldstone boson,
Peccei-Quinn (PQ) axion, and axion decay constant in general. The
high-dimensional operators, which break the $U(1)_{PQ}$ global symmetry, have
dimension eleven or higher due to the anomalous $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, and
thus the axion quality problem is solved. In particular, unlike the
high-quality axion models with anomaly free $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we only need
to introduce two pairs of vector-like particles. To be concrete, we present
three specific models with two pairs of vector-like particles. We show that
gauge anomalies in all three models can be canceled via the Green-Schwarz
mechanism. To achieve gauge coupling unification, we need to introduce
additional vector-like particles only in Model I. We find that gauge coupling
unification is achieved at the unification scale around $10^{16}$ GeV with a
relative error of less than 1\%. Notably, gauge coupling unification in Model
II is achieved naturally with the smallest relative error of 0.1\%.

*Yifan Hu,Ning Liu,Liangliang Su,Bin Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores using semiconductor-based dark matter detectors to probe leptophobic dark matter through plasmon excitation induced by hadronic loops, setting new exclusion limits on scattering cross sections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dark matter experiments focused on electron interactions can also probe nucleon-coupled dark matter via quantum effects. The study aims to utilize plasmon excitation in silicon detectors to detect leptophobic dark matter and improve exclusion limits.

Method: Analysis of plasmon excitations in silicon detectors caused by boosted dark matter and cosmic-ray up-scattered dark matter via hadronic loop processes. Experimental data is used to derive exclusion limits on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section.

Result: New exclusion limits on the scattering cross section for leptophobic dark matter are established, leveraging plasmon detection mechanisms in semiconductor detectors.

Conclusion: Semiconductor detectors' sensitivity to plasmon excitations via hadronic loops offers a promising avenue for probing leptophobic dark matter, complementing traditional detection methods.

Abstract: Some new-generation dark matter detection experiments are primarily designed
to search for the dark matter-electron interactions, but they can also be
utilized to probe models in which dark matter couples exclusively to nucleon
via the quantum effects. The hadronic loop-induced interactions can directly
excite plasmons in semiconductors, thereby providing an additional channel for
detecting the leptophobic dark matter. In this work, we investigate plasmon
excitations in silicon detectors induced by boosted dark matter and cosmic-ray
up-scattering dark matter via the hadronic loop process. By analyzing the
available experimental data, we derive new exclusion limits on the leptophobic
dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section.

### [13] [Heavy Neutral Lepton at Same-Sign Muon Collider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18390)
*Ryuichiro Kitano,Ian Low,Ryutaro Matsudo,Shohei Okawa,Subhojit Roy*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the potential of discovering Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) at a high-energy muon collider (μTRISTAN) through two signature channels. It emphasizes the collider's ability to surpass current mixing and mass constraints, particularly for ~5-10 TeV HNLs mixing with muon neutrinos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore HNL discovery potential addressing neutrino mass origins, leveraging μTRISTAN's unique capabilities to probe LFV and LNV processes unavailable at other colliders.

Method: Analyzes two HNL-mediated signatures: lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) channel μ+μ+ → W+τ+ν̄_μ and lepton-number-violating (LNV) channel μ+μ+ → W+W+. Compares collider sensitivity to HNL mixing parameters (with tau/muon neutrinos) across mass ranges against electroweak precision bounds.

Result: μTRISTAN can surpass current electroweak precision bounds for HNL mixing with muon and tau neutrinos, especially improving mixing constraints by an order of magnitude for 5-10 TeV HNLs interacting with muon neutrinos.

Conclusion: A high-energy muon collider like μTRISTAN offers superior sensitivity to HNLs beyond existing limits, providing critical evidence for Majorana neutrinos and probing lepton sector physics beyond the Standard Model.

Abstract: We explore the discovery potential of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), motivated
by models addressing the origin of neutrino masses, at the proposed high-energy
same-sign muon collider known as $\mu$TRISTAN. The study focuses on two
complementary HNL-mediated signatures: (i) the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV)
channel $\mu^+\mu^+ \to W^+\tau^+\bar\nu_\mu$ and (ii) the
lepton-number-violating (LNV) channel $\mu^{+}\mu^{+} \to W^{+}W^{+}$. The LNV
process is the muon analogue of inverse neutrinoless double beta decay and, if
observed, would provide strong evidence for Majorana neutrinos, while the LFV
process offers a novel probe of flavor-changing neutral currents in the lepton
sector. At the $\mu$TRISTAN collider with $\sqrt{s} \sim
\mathcal{O}(10)~\text{TeV}$, the resulting sensitivity to the HNL mixing with
muon and tau neutrinos, as a function of mass, can surpass current bounds from
the measurements of electroweak precision observables over a broad mass range.
In particular, for the mixing with muon neutrinos, the collider bound can
improve by an order of magnitude for $5$-$10$ TeV HNLs.

*Sheng-He Zhu,Fu-Lai Wang,Xiang Liu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates electromagnetic properties (magnetic moments and M1 radiative decays) of predicted double-charm hidden-strangeness pentaquarks using a constituent quark model, exploring three analysis scenarios. Results highlight structural features and potential experimental signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the electromagnetic properties of theoretically predicted double-charm pentaquarks, which could validate their existence and structural configuration through observable features like magnetic moments and decay patterns.

Method: Constituent quark model applied across three scenarios: single-channel, S-D wave mixing, and coupled-channel analyses. Calculations focused on magnetic moments and M1 radiative decay widths to probe internal structure and quantum numbers.

Result: Magnetic moments show configuration-sensitive patterns aiding quantum number identification. Several M1 decay channels with significant widths were identified as potential experimental signatures, revealing distinct structural features.

Conclusion: The results encourage experimental investigation into these pentaquarks' electromagnetic properties to better understand their structure and confirm theoretical predictions about exotic hadronic states.

Abstract: In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the electromagnetic
properties, specifically the magnetic moments and the M1 radiative decay
behavior, of the predicted $\Xi_c^{(',*)}D^{(*)}_s$-type double-charm
hidden-strangeness molecular pentaquarks. The study is carried out within the
framework of the constituent quark model to evaluate these electromagnetic
observables, and our analysis incorporates three distinct scenarios:
single-channel analysis, $S$-$D$ wave mixing analysis, and coupled-channel
analysis. The calculated magnetic moments reveal characteristic patterns that
reflect their underlying constituent configurations and provide sensitive
probes for their quantum number assignments. Furthermore, we identify several
M1 radiative decay channels with sizable widths that may offer promising
signatures for future experimental detection. These M1 transitions also act as
sensitive probes into their inner structures, displaying distinctive features
that help differentiate between their constituent configurations and quantum
number assignments. We anticipate that this study will stimulate experimental
interest in exploring the electromagnetic properties of the
$\Xi_c^{(',*)}D^{(*)}_s$ molecular states, thereby advancing our structural
understanding of these exotic hadronic states.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method calculating fine structure constants with high precision by correlating energy scales (Planck, fermion tip, SU(5) unification) via a linear relationship between lattice link lengths and energy scale logarithms. This validates a quantum fluctuating lattice model and achieves experimental accuracy for fine structure constants' differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve remarkably accurate calculations of fine structure constants and validate the existence of a quantum fluctuating lattice structure in nature by showing precise correlations between energy scales and their corresponding lattice parameters.

Method: The authors correlate four key energy scales (Planck, fermion tip, SU(5) unification, and Z-mass) by modeling them on a hypothetical lattice where the logarithm of energy scales linearly relate to the lattice link length exponents. Quantum corrections account for deviations from classical SU(5) unification predictions.

Result: The derived differences between inverse fine structure constants at the Z-mass scale (α₂⁻¹ - α₃⁻¹) match experimental values within ±0.05 precision: predicted 21.20 vs observed 21.13. Linear correlations across energy scales support the lattice fluctuation hypothesis.

Conclusion: The linear relationship between energy scales and lattice parameters suggests a fundamental quantum lattice structure underlying particle physics. The precise alignment of calculated and experimental constants validates this model, offering new insights beyond standard SU(5) unification without supersymmetry.

Abstract: Remarkably accurate fine structure constants are calculated from assumptions
further developed from two earlier publications. We have put together a series
of energy scales related to various physical phenomena such as the Planck
scale, a scale, which we call ``fermion tip'' being a certain extrapolation
related to the heaviest Fermions in the Standard Model, an approximate SU(5)
unification scale (without susy); and then we found, that as function of the
power of an imagined lattice link length supposedly relevant for the scale in
question, these powers are rather well linearly related to the logarithms of
the associated energy scales. The coincidence of these scales fitting a
straight line is remarkable and in some cases quite intriguing. It is evidence
for Nature truly having a fluctuating lattice, meaning, that the size of the
links say fluctuate quantum mechanically. We review a self-reference obtaining
the three fine structure constants via three theoretically predictable
quantities, among which is a scale on our straight line plot, namely for an
approximate SU(5)-like unification (SU(5) coupling relations are only true in a
classical approximation). Concentrating on the four energy scales, for which
most precise numbers make sense (this is new in the present article), we
interpolate to the approximate unification scale to such an accuracy, that it
combined with the quantum corrections making the deviation from genuine SU(5)
delivers the differences between the three inverse fine structure constants
agreeing within errors being a few units on the second place after the comma!
E.g. we predict the difference between the non-abelian inverse fine structure
constants at the Z-mass MZ to be (1/alpha2 - 1/alpha3)(M_Z)predict=29.62-8.42
=21.20, while the experimental difference is 29.57-8.44=21.13 both with
uncertainties of order +/- 0.05.

### [16] [Towards a Post-Inflationary Composite Axion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18538)
*Aleksandr Azatov,Mohamed Mahdi Khalil,Motoo Suzuki*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Composite axions are a pion-like state that avoid issues with elementary scalars and the quality problem. Two models using SU(5) chiral gauge theory and gauged U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry in SU(N) theories are proposed. These models address domain walls via N_DW=1 and relic dilution through inflation, ensuring axion strings re-enter the horizon appropriately for dark matter production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore composite axion cosmology post-inflation, solve domain wall issues, and manage exotic relics without elementary scalar fine-tuning.

Method: Proposed two models with N_DW=1: one with SU(5) chiral gauge theory and another with gauged U(1) PQ symmetry in vector-like SU(N) theories. Analyzed relic dilution via inflation and axion string re-entry timing relative to QCD transitions.

Result: Identified viable parameter spaces where axion strings re-enter the horizon before/after QCD transitions, with dominant dark matter from string-wall network decays.

Conclusion: Composite axion models with these structures effectively address cosmological challenges, offering a promising avenue for dark matter studies.

Abstract: Composite axions offer a scenario where the axion emerges as a pion-like
state, avoiding fine-tuning of elementary scalars and ameliorating the axion
quality problem. Despite these advantages, their post-inflationary cosmology
remains largely unexplored, with challenges including the domain wall problem
and the presence of exotic relics. We propose two composite axion models with
an effective domain wall number $N_\text{DW} = 1$ and study the dilution of
relics via a short period of inflation. One model is based on an $SU(5)$ chiral
gauge theory, while the other employs a ``gauged'' $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry
in vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We identify the viable parameter space
in which axion strings re-enter the horizon before or even after the QCD
transition and axion dark matter is dominantly produced from the decay of the
string-wall network.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter
(MPVDM), a minimal yet phenomenologically rich extension of the Standard Model
featuring a new SU(2)_D gauge symmetry and vector-like muons. In this framework
the dark sector interacts with the Standard Model only through these heavy
leptons, linking dark matter and the muon sector. The MPVDM can simultaneously
explain the observed relic abundance and the muon anomalous magnetic moment
a_mu under both the "tension" and "compatibility" scenarios motivated by recent
(g-2)_mu results. A key finding is a generic off-resonance velocity suppression
mechanism that allows light (<1 GeV) vector dark matter to evade CMB limits
near 2*m_DM ~ m_H_D. Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner
resonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the
temperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned
near resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the
required CMB era suppression without fine tuning. A five dimensional parameter
scan shows that the tension scenario requires sub GeV dark matter with g_D ~
1e-3 and TeV scale vector like muons, while the compatibility scenario admits a
broad mass range up to multi TeV. Recasting ATLAS and CMS searches for mu+ mu-
+ E_T^miss sets a lower bound of about 850 GeV on vector like muons. The MPVDM
thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally accessible framework
linking dark matter and muon physics across cosmological and collider
frontiers.

### [18] [Constraints on Attractor Models of Inflation and Reheating from Planck, BICEP/Keck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18656)
*John Ellis,Marcos A. G. Garcia,Keith A. Olive,Sarunas Verner*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study evaluates the latest CMB data from multiple experiments to constrain scalar spectral index (n_s) and tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) in α-attractor inflation models. It finds E-models with α ≤25 and reheating temperatures between 100–10^10 GeV align well with Planck 2018 data, while T-models show mild tension. Generalized models with monomial potentials (k≥6) and deformed models can better match ACT DR6 observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to test attractor models of inflation against recent CMB constraints, specifically examining how well E- and T-models align with data from Planck, BICEP/Keck, ACT, and SPT, and to explore extensions like generalized α-attractors and deformed potentials that might improve agreements.

Method: The authors systematically compare observational data (Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, ACT DR6, SPT-3G) with theoretical predictions of E-models (α-Starobinsky) and T-models. They analyze the parameter space considering reheating temperatures and extend the analysis to generalized potentials (V ∝ φ^k) and deformed models.

Result: E-models with α ≤25 and reheating temps from 100-10^10 GeV align with Planck data, but fall below Planck-ACT-DESI 95% CL. T-models predict n_s 0.956-0.961 (mild tension with Planck). Generalized models (k≥6) predict n_s 0.965-0.968 matching ACT DR6. Deformed models allow higher n_s for α≈1.

Conclusion: Current CMB data favor E-models over T-models with certain constraints on α and reheating conditions. Generalized α-attractors (especially higher k values) and deformed potentials offer promising paths to better align with experimental results like ACT DR6.

Abstract: We analyze the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints on the
scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from Planck 2018,
BICEP/Keck 2018, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6), and
the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) data, focusing on their implications for
attractor models of inflation. We compare systematically observational bounds
with theoretical predictions for both E-model ($\alpha$-Starobinsky) and
T-model potentials. The observational constraints accommodate E-models with
$\alpha \lesssim 25$, with the canonical Starobinsky model ($\alpha = 1$)
predicting $n_s = 0.958-0.963$ for reheating temperatures between $100 -
10^{10}$ GeV, in good agreement with Planck 2018 data and within the 95% CL
region determined by the Planck-ACT-SPT combination, but below the 95%
confidence region of the Planck-ACT-DESI combination. Higher reheating
temperatures from near-instantaneous reheating improve the compatibility.
T-models predict slightly lower $n_s$ values (0.956-0.961), in some tension
with Planck 2018 data, and we find an upper limit of $\alpha \lesssim 11$ in
these models. We extend our analysis to generalized $\alpha$-attractors with
monomial potentials $V(\varphi) \propto \varphi^k$ near the minimum,
demonstrating that models with $k \geq 6$ naturally predict $n_s \simeq 0.965 -
0.968$ for typical number of $e$-folds, in better agreement with the ACT DR6
data. We also consider deformed E- and T-models, which allow significantly
higher values of $n_s$ for low values of $\alpha \simeq 1$.

Abstract: We compute squared matrix elements at next-to-next-to-leading order in
perturbative quantum chromodynamics for the production of two or three (on- or
off-shell) photons mediated via (light or heavy) quark loops. Our method
handles all cases in a unified framework, using simultaneous subtraction of
infrared, ultraviolet, and threshold singularities in loop momentum space to
produce a locally finite integrand suitable for numerical integration. We
confirm agreement with available analytic benchmarks at fixed phase-space
points and provide new results otherwise. We also compute the double-virtual
corrections to the cross section for on- and off-shell diphoton and on-shell
triphoton production by combining the Monte Carlo integration over loop and
phase space.

*Riccardo Bartocci,Philipp Böer,Tobias Hurth*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents advancements in incorporating next-to-leading order (NLO) radiative corrections for the subleading-power factorization formula in the Q₁q-Q7γ interference contribution within B̄→Xsγ decays, focusing on high photon energies. Key contributions include the one-loop anomalous dimension of the subleading shape function g₁₇ and two-loop jet function corrections with an internal charm loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision in calculating radiative decays like B̄→Xsγ by addressing subleading-power effects, which are critical at large photon energies where leading-power contributions are suppressed.

Method: Computed the one-loop anomalous dimension of the subleading shape function g₁₇(ω,ω₁;μ) and derived two-loop corrections to the jet function involving internal charm loops. The authors simplified the renormalization process for generalized three-particle B-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes with non-aligned light-like field separations.

Result: Successfully renormalized the subleading shape function g₁₇ and demonstrated a more straightforward renormalization approach for specific generalized distribution amplitudes, crucial for accurate NLO analysis in this context.

Conclusion: These results advance the theoretical framework for precision studies of B̄→Xsγ decays, enabling better agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements by incorporating necessary NLO corrections and improved distribution amplitude handling.

Abstract: We report on progress towards including next-to-leading order (NLO) radiative
corrections to the subleading-power factorization formula for the
$Q_1^{q}-Q_{7\gamma}$ interference contribution in $\bar{B}\to X_s\gamma$ at
large photon energies, $m_b - 2E_\gamma = \mathcal{O}(\Lambda_{\rm QCD})$. The
novel ingredients for a NLO analysis are the one-loop anomalous dimension of
the subleading shape function $g_{17}(\omega,\omega_1;\mu)$, which was recently
computed by us, and the two-loop corrections to the jet function with an
internal charm loop. Here we summarize the renormalization of
$g_{17}(\omega,\omega_1;\mu)$, and further discuss that our insights allow for
a simplified renormalization of a specific generalization of a three-particle
$B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude, but with non-aligned light-like
separations of the fields.

Abstract: We present new state-of-the-art predictions for Standard Model Higgs boson
production in association with a bottom-quark pair ($b\bar bH$). Updated cross
sections are computed in accordance with the recommendations of the LHC Higgs
Working Group, including the use of the PDF4LHC21 set of parton distribution
functions, with a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV. For the total inclusive
cross section, we provide matched predictions of the massless five-flavour
scheme (5FS) and the massive four-flavour scheme (4FS) at the fixed-order
level. We further present recently obtained simulations matched with parton
showers in both flavour schemes within the SM, and also discuss them in the
context of potential BSM scenarios. In the massless scheme, we compare
different NNLO+PS predictions obtained through the MiNNLOPS and GENEVA
generators. In addition, the role of 4FS predictions is studied as a background
to $HH$ searches, considering both the top-quark and bottom-quark Yukawa
contributions to $b\bar bH$ production. Finally, we analyse the sensitivity of
the Higgs transverse momentum spectrum to light-quark Yukawa couplings in the
diphoton decay channel based on MiNNLOPS simulations.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel quantum simulation approach using Light-front QCD to compute fragmentation functions, specifically calculating the c→J/ψ process, which was previously intractable with ab initio methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the longstanding challenge of calculating fragmentation functions from first principles, which are crucial for understanding particle production in high-energy collisions but were previously unsolvable with existing methods.

Method: The method involves deploying QCD in Light-front Quantization with discretized Fock and momentum spaces, using a particle-register encoding suitable for quantum simulations. A classical simulation was used to demonstrate the approach by calculating charm-to-charmonium fragmentation.

Result: The result is a proof-of-concept calculation of the c→J/ψ fragmentation function, showing agreement with the 1993 perturbative Nonrelativistic QCD results, thus validating the new computational framework.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this quantum simulation framework opens new avenues for ab initio studies of fragmentation functions, potentially improving predictions for particle physics experiments where such functions are essential.

Abstract: We deploy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in Light-front Quantization (and
Gauge), discretized and truncated in both Fock --and momentum-- spaces with a
particle-register encoding suited for quantum simulation; we show for the first
time how to calculate fragmentation functions, a problem heretofore untractable
in general from \emph{ab-initio} approaches. We provide a classical-simulator
based proof-of-concept by computing the charm-to-charmonium fragmentation,
$c\to J/\psi$, in a simplified setup, an interesting case where we can
(reasonably) compare with the known 1993 perturbative evaluation within
Nonrelativistic QCD.

Motivation: To improve theoretical precision in SIDIS predictions by incorporating higher-order QED and QCD⊗QED corrections, building on existing NNLO QCD results.

Method: Computed using QCD factorization framework with dimensional regularization, consistent renormalization, and mass factorization. Built upon previous NNLO QCD calculations.

Result: NNLO QED and QCD⊗QED terms improve perturbative stability and reduce scale uncertainties, crucial for high-precision predictions at facilities like the Electron-Ion Collider.

Conclusion: These corrections are essential for achieving high-precision SIDIS results, particularly important for future particle physics experiments such as those at the Electron-Ion Collider.

Abstract: We present the first computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) pure
QED and mixed QCD$\otimes$QED corrections to unpolarized and polarized
semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Building on our previous NNLO
QCD results, these corrections are crucial for improving the theoretical
precision. The coefficient functions are derived within the QCD factorization
framework using dimensional regularization, with consistent renormalization and
mass factorization. A detailed phenomenological analysis shows that the NNLO
QED and QCD$\otimes$QED terms enhance perturbative stability and reduce scale
uncertainties. These results are essential for high-precision SIDIS predictions
at future facilities such as the Electron-Ion Collider.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper discusses four methods for detecting extraterrestrial artifacts in the Solar System, focusing on the use of Earth's shadow as a filter. A proof-of-concept search using the ZTF identified previously unknown events, highlighting the potential of this approach for near-Earth SETI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of formal scientific interest and overcome challenges in searching for extraterrestrial artifacts in the solar system, leveraging new observational techniques.

Method: The paper outlines four methods: pre-Sputnik images for glinting objects, space telescopes, reflectance spectra analysis, and Earth's shadow filtering. It implements the latter using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to search for transient events in Earth's shadow.

Result: The ZTF search identified previously uncatalogued events near the center of Earth's shadow, demonstrating the method's potential.

Conclusion: The Earth's shadow is a promising new domain for near-Earth SETI searches, warranting further exploration with this technique.

Abstract: For centuries, astronomers have discussed the possibility of inhabited worlds
- from Herschel's 18th-century observations suggesting Mars may host life, to
the systematic search for technosignatures that began in the 1960s using radio
telescopes. Searching for artifacts in the solar system has received relatively
little formal scientific interest and has faced significant technical and
social challenges. Automated surveys and new observational techniques developed
over the past decade now enable astronomers to survey parts of the sky for
anomalous objects.
  We briefly describe four methods for detecting extraterrestrial artifacts and
probes within the Solar System and then focus on demonstrating one of these.
The first makes use of pre-Sputnik images to search for flashes from glinting
objects. The second method makes use of space-borne telescopes to search for
artificial objects. A third approach involves examining the reflectance spectra
of objects in Earth orbit, in search of the characteristic reddening that may
imply long-term exposure of metallic surfaces to space weathering. We focus
here on a fourth approach, which involves using Earth's shadow as a filter when
searching for optically luminous objects in near-Earth space. We demonstrate a
proof-of-concept of this method by conducting two searches for transients in
images acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has generated
many repeated 30-second exposures of the same fields.
  In this way, we identified previously uncatalogued events at short angular
separations from the center of the shadow, motivating more extensive searches
using this technique. We conclude that the Earth's shadow presents a new and
exciting search domain for near-Earth SETI.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper discusses the detection of Solar 8B neutrinos using the XENONnT dual-phase detector and addresses unexplained detector effects, such as surface charge accumulation and instability near wire crossings, which may introduce systematic errors in small signal detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and mitigate detector-related systematic errors caused by surface charge accumulation and instabilities in the XENONnT detector, particularly in regions where anomalies were observed (wire crossings), to ensure accurate neutrino detection.

Method: The analysis examines the accumulation of surface charges and charged surface instability at wire crossing regions, which cause maximal surface elevation and charge density. The study considers the exclusion of data from these regions but highlights that surface distortions and charges are widespread, potentially affecting small signal measurements.

Result: The results indicate that even though data from problematic regions (wire crossings) were excluded, the pervasive nature of surface distortions and charges could lead to significant systematic errors in the detection of small signals like Solar 8B neutrinos.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the necessity of addressing surface charge and instability issues across the entire detector to minimize systematic errors and improve the accuracy of future neutrino detection experiments.

Abstract: Announcement of detection of Solar 8B neutrinos by XENONnT dual-phase
detector come with a suite of unexplained detector effects. We expect
accumulation of surface charges and charged surface instability resulting in
maximal surface elevation and charge density at wire crossing regions, where
anomalies were observed. Thou data from these regions were excluded from
analysis, surface distortions and charges are present everywhere, which can
lead to large systematic errors in small signal detection.

*Leigh N. Fletcher,Amy Simon,Michael H. Wong,Jonathan D. Nichols,Nick A. Teanby,Conor A. Nixon,Marina Galand*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper advocates for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to be designed with capabilities tailored for observing giant planets and their atmospheres, including tracking non-sidereal targets, high dynamic range imaging/spectroscopy, and specialized instruments to capture UV/visible spectra and time-resolved auroral/cloud dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Giant planets like Jupiter provide critical analogs for understanding exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Their complex atmospheres and interactions with magnetospheres offer insights into stellar-host systems. Current and future observatories must address the technical challenges posed by these targets' movement, brightness, and variability.

Method: The authors outline specific design requirements for HWO: 1) non-sidereal tracking for moving targets; 2) filters/fast readout to avoid saturation of bright auroras/atmospheres; 3) high dynamic range for faint objects near bright disks; 4) spectroscopic coverage from 80 nm to 900 nm to capture key molecular features; 5) multi-timescale imaging (seconds for auroras, hours/days for clouds, months for long-term variability); 6) instrumental field-of-view considerations (e.g., Jupiter's 50+ arcsec size) and integral field units with variable fields of view.

Result: Proposed specifications enable spatially-resolved studies of giant planet atmospheres/ionospheres, revealing 3D structures via molecular absorptions, aerosols, airglow, and auroras. This would support comparative planetology and exoplanet interpretation.

Conclusion: HWO must prioritize these capabilities to unlock the full scientific potential of giant planets as laboratories for understanding exoplanet diversity and stellar-magnetosphere interactions.

Abstract: Visible and ultraviolet imaging and spectroscopy of Solar System giant
planets can set the paradigm for the atmospheric, ionospheric, and
magnetospheric processes shaping the diversity of giant exoplanets, brown
dwarfs, and their interactions with stellar hosts. Spectra of their molecular
absorptions, aerosol scattering, airglow, and auroral emissions can reveal
these dynamic atmospheres in three dimensions. Given that giant planets are
extended, bright, moving, and rotating objects, with extreme dynamic range and
highly variable appearances, they impose specific mission and instrumentation
requirements on future large space-based optical/UV observatories like the
proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We advocate that HWO must have the
capability to track non-sidereal targets like the giant planets and their
satellites; should be able to view auroras and atmospheres without saturation
(e.g., through the use of filters or fast read-out modes); and with a high
dynamic range to explore faint objects near bright discs. HWO should enable
spatially-resolved spectroscopy from $\sim80$ nm to $\sim900$ nm, capturing
H$_2$ Lyman and Werner band series and H Lyman-$\alpha$ in the far-UV;
molecular absorptions and scattering in the mid-UV/visible; and deep
hydrogen/methane absorptions in the 800-900 nm for cloud characterisation and
CH$_4$ mapping. Imaging should enable time-resolved observations, from seconds
to create auroral movies, to hours for cloud tracking and winds, to months and
years for atmosphere/ionosphere variability. We advocate that an imager should
have sufficient field of view to capture Jupiter ($>50$\arcsec), and that
UV/visible integral field spectrographs be considered with both narrow
($3$\arcsec) and wide ($>10$\arcsec) field capabilities to provide efficient
mapping of atmospheres and auroras. [Abbr]

Motivation: To map the current presence of women in French professional astronomy and establish a baseline for tracking changes over time, expanding on a previous 2021 survey.

Method: A statistical analysis of data from 11 institutes (1,525 employees), including PhD students, postdocs, academics, and staff, comparing results to the 2021-2022 survey.

Result: Women's representation decreases significantly with higher career stages, job security, qualification levels, and income, indicating a leaky pipeline effect, particularly in accessing permanent roles.

Conclusion: Persistent gender disparities exist in leadership and senior positions within French astronomy, emphasizing the need for interventions to address systemic barriers preventing women from advancing to permanent roles.

Abstract: The Commission Femmes et Astronomie of the French Astronomical Society, has
conducted a statistical study aimed at mapping the current presence of women in
French professional astronomy and establishing a baseline for tracking its
evolution over time. This study follows an initial survey carried out in 2021,
which covered eight astronomy and astrophysics institutes (1,060 employees).
This year, the scope was expanded to 11 institutes, bringing together a total
of 1,525 employees, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers,
academics, as well as technical and administrative staff, representing about
57% of the whole French community. We examined how the proportion of women
varies according to career stage, level of responsibility, job security, and
income. The results are compared to the 2021-2022 survey and appear to
illustrate the well-known "leaky pipeline", with one of the main bottlenecks
being access to permanent positions. The study shows that the proportion of
women consistently declines with increasing job security, career seniority,
qualification level, and salary.

Abstract: Sequential scientific data span many resolutions and domains, and unifying
them into a common representation is a key step toward developing foundation
models for the sciences. Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive
surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths
and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g.,
optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the
ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model
that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our
universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types
and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing
intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations
that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a
range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single
model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that
our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in
astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with
heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: AION-1 is a family of large-scale multimodal foundation models designed for astronomy, capable of integrating diverse data types like images, spectra, and scalar data from multiple surveys. It achieves strong performance across various tasks using a two-stage architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Astronomy lacks a unified framework for joint modeling across diverse data modalities, so the authors developed AION-1 to address this gap by creating a scalable multimodal model that can handle heterogeneous astronomical data.

Method: A two-stage architecture: modality-specific tokenization of imaging, spectroscopic, and scalar data, followed by transformer-based masked modeling of cross-modal token sequences. Pretrained on five large surveys with over 200M observations.

Result: AION-1 achieves strong results on tasks like galaxy property estimation, morphology classification, retrieval, segmentation, and spectral super-resolution using a single frozen encoder. Model variants range from 300M to 3.1B parameters.

Conclusion: The models provide a blueprint for multimodal scientific foundation models, enabling integration of noisy, instrument-specific data. All resources are openly released for further development.

Abstract: While foundation models have shown promise across a variety of fields,
astronomy still lacks a unified framework for joint modeling across its highly
diverse data modalities. In this paper, we present AION-1, a family of
large-scale multimodal foundation models for astronomy. AION-1 integrates
heterogeneous imaging, spectroscopic, and scalar data using a two-stage
architecture: modality-specific tokenization followed by transformer-based
masked modeling of cross-modal token sequences. The model is pretrained on five
large-scale surveys: Legacy Survey, Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Gaia. These
span more than 200 million observations of stars, galaxies, and quasars. With a
single frozen encoder, AION-1 achieves strong results on a broad suite of
downstream tasks, including galaxy and stellar property estimation, galaxy
morphology classification, similarity-based retrieval, galaxy image
segmentation, and spectral super-resolution. We release AION-1 model variants
ranging from 300 M to 3.1 B parameters. Beyond astronomy, AION-1 provides a
scalable blueprint for multimodal scientific foundation models that can
seamlessly integrate noisy, instrument-specific observations. All code,
tokenizers, pretrained weights, and a lightweight evaluation suite are released
under an open-source license.

### [30] [Close-in faint companions mimicking interferometric hot exozodiacal dust observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18047)
*Katsiaryna Tsishchankava,Florian Kirchschlager,Anton Krieger,Thomas A. Stuber,Sebastian Wolf*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study investigates whether observed infrared excesses in stars are due to hot exozodiacal dust or faint companions. Through simulations of interferometric observations with VLTI instruments, they found that faint companions can cause visibility deficits without showing in closure phases, challenging existing rejection criteria. They suggest revisiting past studies and propose a new method to differentiate between the two sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is the need to determine the origin of unexpected infrared excesses observed in nearby main-sequence stars. The two leading possibilities are hot exozodiacal dust or faint companions, both of which produce similar interferometric signals, making it challenging to distinguish them. This ambiguity hinders accurate interpretations of previous observations and requires a systematic analysis.

Method: The authors modeled a system with a star and a faint companion within a 2au x 2au field, simulating interferometric visibility and closure phase measurements using three VLTI instruments and multiple telescope configurations. They analyzed detection probabilities and developed criteria to assess detectability, then tested these by reevaluating observed data of kappa Tuc A.

Result: Key results include establishing upper limits for companion-induced visibility deficits and closure phase changes. They found that companions with flux ratios as low as 0.7% can produce measurable visibility deficits but may remain undetected in closure phase data (non-detection probability ~21%). Their reanalysis of kappa Tuc A supports the possibility of a faint companion explaining observed variability.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that traditional methods relying on near-zero closure phases and Gaussian dust models to reject companions are unreliable. It emphasizes the need to reassess previous studies and introduces a new method to differentiate between companions and exozodiacal dust based on visibility and closure phase analysis.

Abstract: Context: Interferometric observations of various nearby main-sequence stars
show an unexpected infrared excess, raising the question of its origin. The two
dominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as
both can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of
a star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated
the visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY,
and MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the
interferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability.
We explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges
in distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the
source of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the
companion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common
interpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a
companion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data,
as indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions
can still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by
reevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a
faint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection
probability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the
previously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion
rejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based
on Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This
highlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former
studies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon. In addition, we propose a
method for distinguishing both sources of visibility deficit.

### [31] [Spectroscopic study of the light-polluted night sky in Hong Kong](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18200)
*Chu Wing So,Chun Shing Jason Pun,Shengjie Liu*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper presents a spectroscopic analysis of urban night skyglow using over 12,000 spectra collected between 2021-2023, revealing contributions from various artificial light sources like LEDs, fluorescent lamps, and neon signs. It highlights shifts in lighting technologies and the need for mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The urban night sky's spectral properties are poorly understood despite their importance in assessing light pollution. Prior studies focused on remote observatories, leaving urban areas understudied. This motivated the first comprehensive spectroscopic investigation to identify light sources contributing to skyglow and track technological shifts.

Method: The team used compact spectrometers to collect over 12,000 zenith sky spectra across urban/suburban sites from 2021-2023. They analyzed spectral features corresponding to common light sources (CFL, HPS, LEDs, neon) to quantify contributions and temporal patterns, including comparisons with decade-old data.

Result: Skyglow is dominated by artificial emissions from CFLs and HPS lamps. LED and metal halide lighting (used in floodlights/advertising) dominate urban areas before midnight. A neon sign on a commercial tower showed significant local impact. Data shows increased LED use for external lighting, aligning with previous studies.

Conclusion: Spectroscopic studies are critical for understanding light pollution dynamics and guiding mitigation policies. The findings underscore the importance of monitoring evolving outdoor lighting technologies and implementing targeted strategies to reduce light pollution in urban and astronomical sites.

Abstract: Spectroscopic study of the night sky has been a common way to assess the
impacts of artificial light at night at remote astronomical observatories.
However, the spectroscopic properties of the urban night sky remain poorly
documented. We addressed this gap by collecting more than 12,000 zenith sky
spectra with compact spectrometers at urban and suburban sites from 2021 to
2023. Here, by examining the intensity variations of the spectral features that
represent characteristic emissions from common artificial light sources, we
show that the skyglow is predominantly shaped by artificial emissions,
including compact fluorescent lamps and high-pressure sodium lamps.
Contributions from commercially controlled lighting, including those for
floodlighting and advertising adopting light-emitting diode and metal halide
technologies, were more pronounced in urban areas during the hours leading up
to midnight. We also documented direct evidence of the impact of a neon sign
located on top of a commercial tower, illustrating how a single light source
can significantly influence the surrounding environment. Compared with
observations made a decade ago at the same location, our findings indicate a
growing popularity of light-emitting diode lighting for external use,
consistent with the existing literature. This first comprehensive spectroscopic
investigation of light pollution in an urban environment emphasizes the
evolving patterns of outdoor lighting and highlights the critical and unique
role of spectroscopic measurements. The results provide essential information
for the development of effective strategies and policies to mitigate light
pollution in urban areas and at sites of astronomical importance.

Abstract: We investigate the imaging properties of spherically symmetric
Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion
flows, adopting a phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow
(RIAF) model and an analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF)
model. General relativistic radiative transfer is employed to compute
synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images.
For the RIAF model, we analyze the dependence of image morphology on the
deformation parameter, observing frequency, and flow dynamics. The photon ring
and central dark region expand with increasing deformation parameter, with
brightness asymmetries arising at high inclinations and depending on flow
dynamics and emission anisotropy. The BAAF disk produces narrower rings and
darker centers, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution
and vary with viewing angle and deformation, revealing spacetime structure.
These results demonstrate that intensity and polarization in thick-disk models
provide probes of KZ black holes and near-horizon accretion physics.

### [33] [Investigating the mysterious nature of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u through deep XMM-Newton observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17970)
*G. Brunelli,G. Ponti,H. Zhang,E. de Oña Wilhelmi,V. Sguera,C. Vignali,R. Zanin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the origin of the VHE source 1LHAASO J1740+0948u near PSR J1740+1000 using XMM-Newton X-ray data and SED fitting. The analysis suggests the TeV emission likely arises from an older, X-ray-faint population of electrons, possibly from the pulsar's relic pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or halo. The magnetic field constraint (B ≤1.2 µG) supports a halo scenario, but more observations are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the connection between 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and PSR J1740+1000 despite their separation, and determine whether the VHE emission originates from the pulsar's PWN, tail, or halo using multi-wavelength data.

Method: Analyzed ~500 ks of XMM-Newton X-ray observations to study diffuse emission around PSR J1740+1000 and its tail. Performed spectral analysis of the tail's X-ray emission and SED fitting combining X-ray upper limits with LHAASO VHE data to constrain parameters like magnetic field strength.

Result: Diffuse X-ray emission showed upper limits in 0.5-10 keV. The tail's X-ray spectrum followed a power law (Γ=1.76±0.06) without significant spectral variations. SED fitting没能同时解释X射线尾部和LHAASO的TeV光谱，暗示TeV发射源自较老的X射线暗的电子种群。磁约束B≤1.2微高斯支持脉冲星halo场景，但需更多观测确认。

Conclusion: 1LHAASO J1740+0948u可能是PSR J1740+1000的relic PWN或halo，但需深度多波段观测确认。光谱分析显示X射线暗的高能电子种群特征，说明该源已进入老化阶段或属于低磁环境的年轻halo。

Abstract: 1LHAASO J1740+0948u is a very-high-energy (VHE) source reported by LHAASO,
with no counterpart at other wavelengths. It is located at 0.2{\deg} from PSR
J1740+1000, a radio and gamma-ray pulsar placed well above the Galactic plane,
which displays an X-ray tail. Despite the offset, the association between the
two sources is likely. We aim to study the diffuse X-ray emission around PSR
J1740+1000 and its tail to investigate the origin of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u
through a multi-wavelength SED fitting, testing different scenarios. We
analysed ~500 ks of XMM-Newton observations and studied for the first time the
diffuse emission around the pulsar. We also analysed the tail and how its
emission evolves as a function of distance. We then performed a fit of the SED,
including the spectrum of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and the X-ray data obtained from
either the analysis of the tail or the diffuse emission, to understand whether
one of the two X-ray sources could be related to the TeV emission and attempt a
source classification. The diffuse X-ray emission analysis resulted in upper
limits in the 0.5-10 keV range. The tail is best fitted with a power law with
$\Gamma=1.76\pm0.06$ in 0.5-8 keV, with no significant detection of spectral
variations with distance. We do not find a good SED fit that can explain both
the X-ray tail and the LHAASO spectrum with reasonable parameters, suggesting
that the TeV emission likely comes from an older X-ray-faint electron
population. We then performed an SED fitting of the VHE spectrum combined with
the upper limits on the diffuse emission, constraining the magnetic field to be
as low as $B\leq1.2 \mu$G. We suggest that 1LHAASO J1740+0948u could represent
either the relic PWN of PSR J1740+1000 or its pulsar halo. Our energy density
results hint at a halo-like nature for 1LHAASO J1740+0948u, but deeper
multi-wavelength observations are required to confirm this hypothesis.

*Michael Unger*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents fragmentation cross sections for carbon breakup into B and C isotopes using NA61/SHINE data, with future high-statistics data for light cosmic rays and oxygen beam studies to verify high-energy cross-section behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cosmic-ray fragmentation cross sections are crucial for interpreting secondary/primary cosmic-ray flux measurements from balloon/space experiments. NA61/SHINE provides unique capability at energies >10 GeV/c per nucleon.

Method: Analysis of 2018 pilot run data for carbon fragmentation into ¹⁰B, ¹¹B, ¹¹C at 13.5 GeV/c per nucleon. 2024 high-statistics data (40M triggers) for Li-Si projectiles and 2025 150 GeV/c oxygen beam data to study cross-section flattening at high energies.

Result: Presented necessary cross sections for cosmic-ray boron-to-carbon ratio analysis. Future data will enable full reaction network reconstruction and verify high-energy cross-section trends.

Conclusion: Results improve interpretation of cosmic-ray data, future NA61/SHINE campaigns will significantly enhance understanding of light secondary cosmic rays and fragmentation dynamics at extreme energies.

Abstract: Accurate measurements of cosmic-ray fragmentation cross sections are
essential for maximizing the physics potential of precise measurements of
secondary and primary cosmic-ray fluxes from current balloon and space-borne
experiments. NA61/SHINE, operating at the CERN SPS H2 beamline, is uniquely
suited to studying these interactions at energies above 10 GeV/c per nucleon.
In this contribution, we present the fragmentation cross sections for the
breakup of carbon into $^{10}$B, $^{11}$B and $^{11}$C at 13.5 GeV/c per
nucleon that are needed for interpreting the cosmic-ray boron-to-carbon ratio.
These results are based on data from a pilot run conducted in 2018. We also
give an overview of the high-statistics data-taking campaign in 2024, which
covered projectile nuclei from lithium to silicon. With over 40 million
recorded beam triggers, this data set will enable the reconstruction of the
full reaction network required to study light secondary cosmic rays.
Furthermore, we report on data collected in 2025 with a primary oxygen beam at
150 GeV/c per nucleon, aimed at verifying the expected flattening of
fragmentation cross sections at high energies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: After the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, the number of detected
binary black hole (BBH) mergers became sufficient to identify statistical
features of the population. We explore how different prescriptions for the
final fate of massive stars and key binary-evolution processes shape isolated
binaries and their remnants. Using \textsc{sevn}, we evolved $10^{7}$ binaries
across 15 metallicities, 3 core-collapse supernova models, 4 PPISN models, and
6 common-envelope (CE) prescriptions, for a total of 990 runs ($9.9 \times
10^{9}$ systems). Both single- and binary-star physics shape the BH mass
distribution: single-star processes control the high-mass tail ($M_{\rm BH}
\geq 45M_{\odot}$), while binary evolution produces pile-ups in specific
intervals. In particular, the bump at $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$, often attributed to
PPISNe, also emerges from binaries evolving only through stable mass transfer,
without CE. Finally, we test a top-heavy IMF, finding it boosts merger numbers
and alters the abundance of systems with a given primary BH mass.

### [36] [Discovery of Powerful Multi-Velocity Ultra-Fast Outflows in the Starburst Merger Galaxy IRAS 05189$-$2524 with XRISM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18027)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of the galaxy IRAS 05189-2524 using XRISM's advanced X-ray instruments reveals complex ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with multiple velocities, suggesting a multi-component outflow structure. These findings imply that powerful UFOs develop during a post-merger phase, potentially influencing future galaxy evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the properties of ultra-luminous infrared galaxy IRAS 05189-2524's X-ray emissions and understand the outflow mechanisms during its active evolutionary phase following a major galaxy merger.

Method: Analysis of XRISM's X-ray microcalorimeter data to identify blueshifted Fe absorption lines and a broad Fe-K emission line, combined with broadband X-ray spectrum observations from the CCD camera to assess accretion processes and outflow dynamics.

Result: Detection of multiple UFO components with velocities ~0.076c to ~0.143c, forming a P Cygni profile, along with a neutrally absorbed power-law continuum and variability indicative of near-Eddington accretion. UFO parameters also showed variability over ~140 ksec, suggesting dynamic outflow structures.

Conclusion: The observed UFOs, with high momentum/energy rates exceeding galactic molecular outflows, suggest they are established during a short starburst phase post-merger and may precede a quasar phase. This system could suppress future star formation via strong UFO activity, highlighting the role of UFOs in galaxy evolution.

Abstract: We observed the X-ray-bright ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, IRAS
05189$-$2524, with XRISM during its performance verification phase. The
unprecedented energy resolution of the onboard X-ray microcalorimeter revealed
complex spectral features at $\sim$7$-$9 keV, which can be interpreted as
blueshifted Fe XXV/XXVI absorption lines with various velocity dispersions,
originating from ultra-fast outflow (UFO) components with multiple bulk
velocities of $\sim0.076c$, $\sim0.101c$, and $\sim0.143c$. In addition, a
broad Fe-K emission line was detected around $\sim7$ keV, forming a P Cygni
profile together with the absorption lines. The onboard X-ray CCD camera
revealed a 0.4$-$12 keV broadband spectrum characterized by a neutrally
absorbed power-law continuum with a photon index of $\sim2.3$, and intrinsic
flare-like variability on timescales of $\sim10$ ksec, both of which are likely
associated with near-Eddington accretion. We also found potential variability
of the UFO parameters on a timescale of $\sim140$ ksec. Using these properties,
we propose new constraints on the outflow structure and suggest the presence of
multiple outflowing regions on scales of about tens to a hundred Schwarzschild
radii, located within roughly two thousand Schwarzschild radii. Since both the
estimated momentum and energy outflow rates of the UFOs exceed those of
galactic molecular outflows, our results indicate that powerful, multi-velocity
UFOs are already well developed during a short-lived evolutionary phase
following a major galaxy merger, characterized by intense starburst activity
and likely preceding the quasar phase. This system is expected to evolve into a
quasar, sustaining strong UFO activity and suppressing star formation in the
host galaxy.

TL;DR: The IceCube Observatory observed isotropic extragalactic neutrinos, with most sources unidentified. Correlating neutrinos with infrared galaxies via angular cross-correlation showed no significant link, suggesting ≤54% of neutrinos are from galaxy-correlated sources. Negative redshift evolutions (k < -1.75) are disfavored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the connection between astrophysical neutrino sources and the large-scale structure of the universe by cross-correlating neutrino events with galaxy distributions, aiming to constrain source properties and evolution.

Method: Performed a two-point angular cross-correlation analysis between IceCube's Northern sky neutrino track events and an infrared galaxy catalog (WISE/2MASS). Tested source density evolution models with dN_s/dV ∝ (1+z)^k.

Result: No statistically significant correlation found between neutrinos and galaxies. Up to 54% (90% CL) of neutrinos may originate from sources linked to the galaxy catalog. Models with k < -1.75 are excluded at 90% CL.

Conclusion: Neutrino sources are likely not strongly associated with nearby large-scale structure traced by infrared galaxies. Source populations likely have moderate redshift evolution constraints, disfavoring strongly declining source densities at higher redshifts.

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed extragalactic astrophysical
neutrinos with an apparently isotropic distribution. Only a small fraction of
the observed astrophysical neutrinos can be explained by known sources.
Neutrino production is thought to occur in energetic environments that are
ultimately powered by the gravitational collapse of dense regions of the
large-scale mass distribution in the universe. Whatever their identity,
neutrino sources likely trace this large-scale mass distribution. The
clustering of neutrinos with a tracer of the large-scale structure may provide
insight into the distribution of neutrino sources with respect to redshift and
the identity of neutrino sources. We implement a two-point angular
cross-correlation of the Northern sky track events with an infrared galaxy
catalog derived from WISE and 2MASS source catalogs that trace the nearby
large-scale structure. No statistically significant correlation is found
between the neutrinos and this infrared galaxy catalog. We find that < ~54% of
the diffuse muon neutrino flux can be attributed to sources correlated with the
galaxy catalog with 90% confidence. Additionally, when assuming that the
neutrino source comoving density evolves following a power-law in redshift,
$dN_s/dV \propto (1+z)^{k}$, we find that sources with negative evolution, in
particular k < -1.75, are disfavored at the 90% confidence level

### [38] [Deep Synoptic Array Science: Searching for Long Duration Radio Transients with the DSA-110](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18136)
*Myles B. Sherman,Nikita Kosogorov,Casey Law,Vikram Ravi,Jakob T. Faber,Stella K. Ocker,Liam Connor,Yuanhong Qu,Kaitlyn Shin,Kritti Sharma,Pranav Sanghavi,Gregg Hallinan,Mark Hodges*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The DSA-110 NSFRB pipeline expands FRB search to 134ms-160.8s durations using real-time GPU-accelerated processing, detecting LPRTs with sensitivity thresholds of 290mJy. Commissioning tests show upper limits on burst rates and rule out some binary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend pulsar/FRB search capabilities to longer periods (3 orders of magnitude beyond FRBs) to detect Galactic LPRTs like CHIME J1634+44, and test theoretical models involving magnetars and WD-M Dwarf binaries.

Method: Real-time image-plane single-pulse search at 1.4GHz using GPU-accelerated Python/JAX code 'cerberus'. Conducted Galactic Plane Survey covering 770 sq degrees, sensitivity testing with B0329+54 pulsar, and model comparison using flux limits.

Result: Set 6σ flux threshold at 290mJy, found burst rate upper limit of ~1hr⁻¹ per sq deg, ruled out WD-M Dwarf binaries with 10-70s periods in 95% of surveyed area. Results support considering both WD-M Dwarf and isolated magnetar models for LPRTs.

Conclusion: Confirmed NSFRB pipeline's capability to detect LPRTs, invalidated specific binary models, and recommends continued real-time strategies like triggered searches and additional surveys for further LPRT discoveries.

Abstract: We describe the design and commissioning tests for the DSA-110 Not-So-Fast
Radio Burst (NSFRB) search pipeline, a 1.4 GHz image-plane single-pulse search
sensitive to 134 ms-160.8 s radio bursts. Extending the pulse width range of
the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) search by 3 orders of magnitude, the NSFRB search is
sensitive to the recently-discovered Galactic Long Period Radio Transients
(LPRTs). The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom
GPU-accelerated search code, \texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX.
We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources
and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the $6\sigma$ flux (fluence) threshold to be
~290 mJy (~40 Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients,
e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54
observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to
search for LPRTs, covering $-3.5^\circ<b<5.7^\circ$ and $141^\circ<l<225^\circ$
(~770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates. We estimate an upper limit
Poissonian burst rate ~1 hr$^{-1}$ per square degree (~7 hr$^{-1}$ per
$3^\circ\times3^\circ$ survey grid cell) maximized across the inner
$|b|<0.25^\circ$ of the surveyed region. By imposing the ~290 mJy flux limit on
two representative models (the magnetar plastic flow model and the White
Dwarf-M Dwarf binary model), we reject with 95% confidence the presence of
White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary LPRTs with periods between ~10-70s within ~95% of
the surveyed region. Combined with the prevalence of LPRTs in the Galactic
Plane, our results motivate further consideration of both White Dwarf-M Dwarf
binary models and isolated magnetar models. We will continue to explore novel
LPRT search strategies during real-time operations, such as triggered
periodicity searches and additional targeted surveys.

### [39] [Electron Acceleration via Lower-Hybrid Drift Instability in Astrophysical Plasmas: Dependence on Plasma Beta and Suprathermal Electron Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18182)
*Ji-Hoon Ha,Elena S. Volnova*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study explores the efficiency of lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI) in accelerating electrons across various plasma environments by examining plasma magnetization (beta parameter) and suprathermal electron distributions. It finds that LHDI-driven acceleration is most effective in low-beta plasmas but can also occur in high-beta plasmas with suprathermal electrons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend previous studies on LHDI from Earth's magnetosphere to broader astrophysical settings like interplanetary, interstellar, and intracluster plasmas. Previous work focused on quasilinear modeling in strongly magnetized regions, but the applicability in weakly magnetized regimes and effects of suprathermal electrons were less understood.

Method: The researchers used a quasilinear model to compute critical plasma beta and electron spectral slope values. They compared instability growth rates with damping rates, and analyzed electron distribution function evolution over time.

Result: Key findings include optimal electron acceleration in low-beta (β < 1) plasmas. However, suprathermal electrons significantly enhance acceleration even in high-beta (β > 1) plasmas. This broadens the applicability of LHDI beyond previously studied environments.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LHDI is a versatile mechanism for electron acceleration across diverse astrophysical plasmas, especially where suprathermal electrons exist. This has implications for understanding energy distribution in space and astrophysical systems like shocks, turbulence, and reconnection sites.

Abstract: Density inhomogeneities are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas,
particularly at magnetic reconnection sites, shock fronts, and within
compressible turbulence. The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous
plasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma
instabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably,
lower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma
environments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies
have primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these
regions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of
LHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized
media, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster
plasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical
settings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized
by the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal
electrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we
determine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable
efficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of
instability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further
analyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm
these critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is
generally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\beta < 1$). However, the
presence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration
via LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\beta > 1$). Finally, we discuss the
astrophysical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of LHDI in
electron acceleration across diverse plasma environments.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model where magnetic perturbations trigger sequential radiation zones to explain single FRED profile GRBs, addressing their self-similar features and challenging traditional central engine duration interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical mechanisms behind single FRED GRB emissions and reconcile observed properties with theoretical models, particularly addressing the self-similarity across energy bands and the composite nature that current theories fail to explain.

Method: Introduces a model where propagating magnetic perturbations sequentially trigger radiation locations, leading to observed characteristics like FRED profiles, multi-band subpulses, spectral evolution, and intensity tracking.

Result: The model successfully explains key observed features of single FRED GRBs, including self-similarity, aligned subpulses, and spectral evolution, and suggests GRB durations don’t reflect central engine activity timescales.

Conclusion: Revises understanding of GRB duration origins, potentially resolving contradictions in the merger-short/collapsar-long classification by decoupling observed duration from central engine activity duration.

Abstract: To understand the physical mechanisms underlying the prompt emission of
gamma-ray bursts (GRB), single FRED (Fast-Rise-Exponential-Decay) profile GRBs
serve as an ideal sample, as they origin from single epoch central engine
activity. These GRBs have been found to exhibit a peculiar morphology-including
the elegant self-similarity across energy bands and the recently discovered
composite nature challenging nearly all existing radiation mechanisms, sparking
widespread curiosity about their origins. Here we propose a physical model
which includes radiation locations sequentially triggered by propagating
magnetic perturbations. It naturally explains all observed properties of these
GRBs, including the self-similar FRED profile, multi-band aligned subpulses,
hard-to-soft spectral evolution, local intensity tracking, and increasing
subpulse durations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the duration of
these GRBs is not reflecting the activity timescale of the central engine,
reconciling recent challenges to the traditional merger-short/collapsar-long
dichotomy of GRBs.

*Alice Perego,Matteo Bonetti,Alberto Sesana,Silvia Toonen,Valeriya Korol*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the observational capabilities of three proposed post-LISA gravitational wave detectors (μAres, AMIGO, Decihertz Observatory) targeting different GW frequencies. It calculates their gravitational wave background and potential for detecting massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, and compact binaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To plan future space-based gravitational wave missions beyond LISA, this work assesses the scientific potential of proposed concepts to guide the ESA Voyage 2050 mission selection.

Method: The study uses an iterative subtraction algorithm to compute the unresolved gravitational wave background (GWB) from all astrophysical sources for each detector. It then calculates detectable signals and source properties for massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, and compact binaries.

Result: Preliminary estimates show how each mission design performs in detecting different GW sources, identifying which systems offer the most promising science return based on signal counts and property analysis.

Conclusion: The analysis provides critical insights into the observational strengths of μAres, AMIGO, and the Decihertz Observatory, aiding in the evaluation of next-generation space-based gravitational wave mission proposals.

Abstract: The space mission LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), scheduled for
launch in 2035, aims to detect gravitational wave (GW) signals in the milli-Hz
band. In the context of ESA Voyage 2050 Call for new mission concepts, other
frequency ranges are explored by the Gravitational-Wave Space 2050 Working
Group to conceive new proposals for a post-LISA space-based detector. In this
work, we give a preliminary estimate of the observational potential of three
mission designs proposed in the literature, namely $\mu$Ares, AMIGO and the
Decihertz Observatory. The analysis framework includes astrophysical GW sources
such as massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals and compact
binaries such as stellar black holes and white dwarfs. For each detector, we
first present a consistent computation of the unresolved gravitational wave
background (GWB) produced by the sum of all anticipated astrophysical
populations, using an iterative subtraction algorithm. We then investigate
which types of systems are the most appealing, by measuring the number of GW
signals detected and exploring the source properties.

*Yinuo Ma,He Gao*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzed 315 GRBs observed by Swift/XRT, finding that both prompt and afterglow X-ray flares share similar properties, suggesting a common origin in the central engine's prolonged activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin of X-ray flares in GRBs, as their direct evidence is scarce despite the belief they stem from central engine activity.

Method: Comprehensive statistical analysis of 315 GRBs' X-ray flares from Swift/XRT data over two decades, categorizing flares into prompt and afterglow types, and comparing their temporal, luminosity, and morphological properties.

Result: Prompt and afterglow flares exhibit similar characteristics (e.g., peak time, duration, luminosity correlations), with prompt flares being brighter and earlier. This indicates a common origin in the central engine, which remains active beyond the prompt emission phase.

Conclusion: X-ray flares' shared origin in the central engine is statistically supported, emphasizing the need for future missions to further study GRB progenitors and central engine properties.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic phenomena in the Universe,
characterized by prompt gamma-ray emission followed by multiwavelength
afterglows. X-ray flares, observed during the afterglow phase, are generally
believed to originate from the prolonged activity of the central engine, though
direct evidence has been scarce. In this study, we present a comprehensive
statistical analysis of X-ray flares from 315 GRBs observed by the Swift/X-ray
Telescope over nearly two decades. We categorize flares into prompt flares
(occurring during the prompt emission phase) and afterglow flares and compare
their temporal and luminosity properties. Our analysis reveals that both types
of flares exhibit similar morphological characteristics, with prompt flares
being brighter and occurring earlier than afterglow flares. We find strong
correlations between flare parameters, such as peak time, duration, and
luminosity, which follow consistent patterns across both flare types. These
findings suggest that X-ray flares, regardless of their timing, share a common
origin in the central engine's activity. Our results imply that the central
engine's activity duration extends beyond the prompt gamma-ray emission phase,
highlighting the importance of considering X-ray flares when studying GRB
progenitors and central engine properties. This work provides robust
statistical evidence supporting the central engine origin of X-ray flares and
underscores the need for future observations with missions like the Space-based
multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor and Einstein Probe to further
elucidate the nature of GRB central engines.

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning framework with a custom loss function and forward model emulator to infer pulsar parameters from light curves, addressing degeneracies and improving accuracy through test-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe neutron star properties and understand extreme matter behavior and magnetic field evolution, overcoming challenges like parameter uncertainties and degeneracies in traditional methods.

Method: A deep learning model using a custom loss function combining a light curve emulator and dissimilarity loss to capture degenerate solutions, plus a test-time optimization step to refine parameters by minimizing light curve discrepancy.

Result: The model successfully generates parameter sets that reproduce light curves consistent with observations, validated using state-of-the-art simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles degeneracies and enhances parameter inference accuracy, offering a valuable tool for multi-messenger astronomy studies on neutron stars.

Abstract: Probing properties of neutron stars from photometric observations of these
objects helps us answer crucial questions at the forefront of multi-messenger
astronomy, such as, what is behavior of highest density matter in extreme
environments and what is the procedure of generation and evolution of magnetic
fields in these astrophysical environments? However, uncertainties and
degeneracies-where different parameter sets produce similar light curves-make
this task challenging. We propose a deep learning framework for inferring
pulsar parameters from observed light curves. Traditional deep learning models
are not designed to produce multiple degenerate solutions for a given input. To
address this, we introduce a custom loss function that incorporates a light
curve emulator as a forward model, along with a dissimilarity loss that
encourages the model to capture diverse, degenerate parameter sets for a given
light curve. We further introduce a test-time optimization scheme that refines
predicted parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between the observed light
curve and those reconstructed by the forward model from predicted parameters
during inference. The model is trained using a suite of state-of-the-art
simulated pulsar light curves. Finally, we demonstrate that the parameter sets
predicted by our approach reproduce light curves that are consistent with the
true observation.

*V. Yu. Kochkina,A. I. Kolbin,T. A. Fatkhullin,A. S. Vinokurov,N. V. Borisov*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of the eclipsing polar SDSS J002637.06+242915.6 reveals a magnetic white dwarf with a magnetic field strength of ~15 MG (with a cyclotron upper limit of 45 MG), determined from H-alpha Zeeman splitting and cyclotron continuum analysis. Orbital parameters like inclination (77.2-80.6°), mass ratio (0.23-0.43), and white dwarf mass (0.42-0.72 M☉) were derived from eclipse light curves and radial velocities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the magnetic field, orbital dynamics, and accretion processes in the eclipsing polar system SDSS J002637.06+242915.6 using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations.

Method: Phase-resolved photometry and spectroscopy included light curve modeling, Doppler tomography of hydrogen and HeII lines, Zeeman splitting analysis of H-alpha, cyclotron continuum modeling, and eclipse timing/radial velocity measurements to determine orbital parameters.

Result: Identified a ~15 MG white dwarf magnetic field via Zeeman triplet; cyclotron continuum constrains B_cyc <45 MG. Derived orbital inclination 77.2-80.6°, mass ratio 0.23-0.43, and white dwarf mass 0.42-0.72 solar masses. Observed distinct hydrogen/HeII emission regions and red cyclotron continuum variability.

Conclusion: The system provides insights into magnetic accretion in polars, with the magnetic field strength resolved through complementary observational techniques. The results support models where cyclotron radiation and Zeeman splitting reflect different field components, and constrain the binary system's physical parameters.

Abstract: We have analyzed phase-resolved photometric and spectroscopic observations of
the eclipsing polar SDSS J002637.06+242915.6. The light curve has a M-shaped
bright phase that was reproduced using a simple model of an accreting magnetic
white dwarf. The hydrogen emission lines exhibit a narrow component formed on
the irradiated hemispere of the donor. The Doppler tomography revealed
differences in the positions of emission regions of hydrogen and HeII
$\lambda$4686 lines. The spectra exhibit a Zeeman absorption triplet of the
H$\alpha$ line, formed in the cold halo around the accretion spot at a magnetic
field strength of $B = 15.1 \pm 1.3$ MG. The spectra of the bright phase have a
red cyclotron continuum, whose orbital variability has been interpreted within
a simple model of an accretion spot. The modeling of the cyclotron continuum
constrains the white dwarf's magnetic field to $B_{cyc} \lesssim 45$ MG. The
analysis of the eclipse light curve and the radial velocities of the irradiated
hemisphere yielded estimates for the orbital inclination $77.2^\circ \le i \le
80.6^\circ$, the mass ratio $0.23 \le q \le 0.43$, and the white dwarf mass
$0.72 \ge M_1/M_\odot \ge 0.42$.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study presents a detailed multi-wavelength analysis of the BL Lac object OJ 287 using 17 years of Swift and Fermi data, revealing flux-dependent spectral transitions in X-rays and correlations between synchrotron parameters and X-ray flux.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex emission mechanisms and variability in OJ 287's relativistic jet through long-term multi-wavelength observations and modelling.

Method: Analysis of optical-UV/X-ray/γ-ray light curves from Swift and Fermi (2008-2025). X-ray spectral analysis across flare, intermediate, and quiescent states. Multi-wavelength SED modelling with a one-zone leptonic model.

Result: Strong correlations between optical/UV/X-ray bands; no γ-ray correlations. Spectral transitions: quiescent (hard X-rays from IC), intermediate (mixed IC/synchrotron), flaring (soft X-rays from synchrotron). Synchrotron peak frequency, SSC peak, and X-ray flux show strong positive correlations.

Conclusion: OJ 287's emission is driven by variable dominance of synchrotron vs. inverse Compton components in the jet, with spectral states reflecting different physical conditions in the emitting region.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength investigation of BL Lac object OJ
287 using Swift and Fermi observatories spanning 2008-2025. The source exhibits
significant flux variability across optical-UV, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray
regimes, with outbursts observed in optical, UV and X-ray frequencies.
Variability and correlation analyses of the long-term lightcurves reveal strong
correlations among optical, UV, and X-ray bands, whereas there is no
significant correlation between $\gamma$-ray and other bands. Using a
decade-long dataset (MJD 57382-60448), we analysed X-ray spectral variability
across different flux states (flare, intermediate, and quiescent).
Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were constructed using a
one-zone leptonic model to investigate the transitional nature of the X-ray
spectral position in the broadband. The analysis reveals OJ 287's consistent
flux-dependent transitional spectral behavior: quiescent states show hard X-ray
spectra dominated by inverse Compton emission; intermediate states exhibit
contributions from both inverse Compton and synchrotron components with
moderately hard spectra; flaring events are characterized by predominantly
synchrotron emission, resulting in soft X-ray spectra. Broadband SED modelling
captures the systematic evolution of model parameters across different activity
states, with correlation analysis revealing strong positive correlations
between synchrotron peak frequency, Synchrotron-Self Compton peak frequency,
and X-ray flux, providing quantitative evidence for the changing dominance of
emission components within the blazar's relativistic jet.

*De-Fu Bu,Xiao-Hong Yang,Liang Chen,Chenwei Yang,Guobin Mou*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates line-driven winds from sub-Eddington accretion disks in TDEs, finding that winds with velocities up to 0.3c and kinetic powers of 1-6% of the Eddington luminosity can form even in small disks when luminosity exceeds 20% of Eddington.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused on super-Eddington accretion winds in TDEs, but properties of sub-Eddington disk winds remained unclear. The research aims to fill this gap to better understand TDE radiation and energy transport mechanisms.

Method: Two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using PLUTO code were conducted to model line-force driven winds from circularized sub-Eddington accretion disks around a 10^6 solar mass black hole in TDE scenarios.

Result: Strong winds (0.3c maximum velocity, 1-6% Eddington kinetic power) are driven when disk luminosity exceeds 20% of Eddington. This occurs despite the small disk size in TDEs. Potential radio emission from wind-medium shocks is also noted.

Conclusion: Line-driven winds from sub-Eddington TDE disks are significant even at luminosities below Eddington, contributing to TDE energetics and observable signatures like radio emissions from shocks.

Abstract: Winds from the accretion disk in tidal disruption events (TDEs) play a key
role in determining the radiation of TDEs. The winds from the super-Eddington
accretion phase in TDEs have recently been studied. However, properties of the
winds from the sub-Eddington accretion disk in TDEs are not clear. We aim to
investigate properties of winds from the circularized sub-Eddington accretion
disk in TDEs. We study the line force driven accretion disk wind. We perform
two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code to study the line
force driven wind from the circularized accretion disk around a $10^6$ solar
mass black hole in TDEs. We find that although the disk has a very small size
in TDEs, strong wind can be driven by line force when the disk have luminosity
higher than $20\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. The maximum velocity of wind
can be as high as $0.3$ times the speed of light. The kinematic power of wind
is in the range of $1\%-6\%$ times the Eddington luminosity. Strong wind can be
driven by line force from the thin disk around a $10^6$ solar mass black hole
in TDEs. We briefly discuss the possible radio emission from the shock when the
wind collides with the surrounding medium.

*P. Laskos-Patkos,S. Papadopoulos,Ch. C. Moustakidis*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores whether a universal relationship exists between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations, finding empirical correlations for specific modes in hadronic matter, though deviations occur with hybrid equations of state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify a measurable correlation that doesn't depend on the equation of state, enabling constraints on stellar properties without direct measurement and potentially probing General Relativity.

Method: Investigated potential universal relations between binding energy and non-radial oscillation frequencies (f and p₁ modes) using hadronic stellar matter models, then tested effects of hybrid equations of state with sharp phase transitions.

Result: Found empirical relationships for oscillation frequency and binding energy in hadronic matter, but noted deviations when hybrid equations of state with phase transitions were included.

Conclusion: Universal relations between binding energy and oscillation frequencies exist under certain conditions, but phase transitions in hybrid models break these relations, highlighting the need for further investigation into equation of state effects.

Abstract: In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of
determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are
independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of
utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar
properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe
of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible
existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars
and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was
related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be
measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found
that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the
binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter.
The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase
transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned
quasi-universal relation.

This helps anticipate detection rates, parameter estimation accuracies, and observational strategies for neutron star mergers.

Method: The method involves generating a synthetic catalog (CosmoDC2_BCO) based on galaxy distributions from CosmoDC2. It simulates GW signals and kilonova emissions, incorporating parameters like signal-to-noise ratios, sky localization, and luminosities. Projections use a simplified Target of Opportunity strategy with detector networks (CE+ET+LVK) and LSST-like survey assumptions.

Result: Key results are: 3G detectors dramatically boost detection rates and parameter precision; combining 2G+3G detectors enhances sky localization and distances for BNS mergers. The projected 5000 kilonova detections (via LSST/CE+ET) mostly come from low-mass BNS mergers forming long-lived NS remnants. However, this is a small fraction of total expected NS mergers, and uncertainties exist in merger rates, kilonova brightness, and survey setups.

Conclusion: The catalog and findings highlight the observational potential of next-gen facilities but stress that actual detection numbers depend heavily on uncertain parameters. This tool aids in planning strategies for multi-messenger astronomy while underscoring the need for more precise models in key areas like merger rates and kilonova properties.

Abstract: We release CosmoDC2_BCO, a synthetic catalog of gravitational-wave events and
electromagnetic counterparts associated with galaxies from CosmoDC2. The
catalog provides intrinsic and extrinsic source parameters, signal-to-noise
ratios, parameter uncertainties, sky localization areas, and kilonova apparent
magnitudes in LSST filters. Our results show that third-generation detector
networks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter
estimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation
ones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision,
particularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity
strategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK
network at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW
counterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly
from low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star
remnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small
fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by
third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying
assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity
distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which
introduce notable uncertainties. Therefore, the estimated detection numbers
should be interpreted with appropriate caution.

### [49] [Particle acceleration at radiative supernova remnant shocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18763)
*Pierre Cristofari*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores particle acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at radiative shocks in supernova remnants (SNRs) during their radiative phase. It finds that DSA can significantly accelerate particles in the early stages, but environmental factors like dense surroundings or longer radiative phases lead to steeper spectra compared to the canonical p^{-4} slope. Young SNRs in dense environments may see inhibited DSA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how radiative cooling affects DSA in SNRs and how this influences particle spectra, especially considering the radiative phase's impact on shock dynamics and particle trapping.

Method: A semi-analytical model in the test-particle limit, calculating proton and electron spectra over SNR lifetimes, considering adiabatic expansion, radiative losses, and reacceleration effects in evolving shock environments.

Result: DSA efficiently accelerates particles early in the radiative phase (first few tens of kyr), but spectra harden/steepen over time due to expanding SNR volume and extended particle confinement leading to losses. Electron spectra are steeper than proton spectra, and dense environments inhibit DSA in young SNRs.

Conclusion: Radiative phase dynamics significantly alter DSA outcomes, with spectra dependent on environmental conditions and shock evolution. Observations of SNRs in radiative phases could provide insights into cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms beyond standard models.

Abstract: Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the
radiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure
downstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).
  We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool
and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of
supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle
acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the
total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our
results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during
the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated
multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be
detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is
found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the
test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a
growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and
the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles
are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron
spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR
shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA
can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total
electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from
thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young
radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for
which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-1} -
1$ M$_{\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA.

### [50] [Multiple shells in supernova 2023ixf support the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18782)
*Noam Soker,Kobi Shiran*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of SN 2023ixf's photospheric phase reveals three constant-velocity shells, aligning with the jittering-jet explosion mechanism involving multiple jet pairs. This supports the JJEM as a primary CCSN mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) by analyzing the photospheric phase of SN 2023ixf and comparing it to remnant structures linked to the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM).

Method: Examined the time evolution of SN 2023ixf's photospheric phase using literature data, identifying three periods of constant expansion velocity corresponding to ejecta shells. Compared these observations to morphological features of CCSN remnants associated with multiple shells and JJEM.

Result: Observed three distinct photospheric shells in SN 2023ixf, consistent with two-or-three-shelled CCSN remnants. These features align with the JJEM requiring multiple jet pairs during explosion.

Conclusion: The photospheric shell structure of SN 2023ixf supports the JJEM as its explosion mechanism, reinforcing growing evidence that JJEM is the primary CCSN mechanism.

Abstract: Examining the photospheric time evolution of the core-collapse supernova
(CCSN) SN 2023ixf from the literature, we identify three evolutionary time
periods with constant expansion velocities, which we attribute to three ejecta
shells. We find that several CCSN remnants have morphologies with two or more
complete or partial shells, compatible with the presence of two or three
photospheric shells during the photospheric phase of the explosion. Studies
have attributed these CCSN remnants to the jittering-jet explosion mechanism
(JJEM), which involves two or three energetic pairs of jets participating in
the explosion. We, therefore, conclude that the structure of the photospheric
shells of SN 2023ixf supports its explosion by the JJEM. This study adds to the
accumulating evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of
CCSNE.

### [51] [The role of the secondary white dwarf in a double-degenerate double-detonation explosion, in the supernova remnant phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18800)
*Gilles Ferrand,Rüdiger Pakmor,Yusei Fujimaru,Shiu-Hang Lee,Samar Safi-Harb,Shigehiro Nagataki,Friedrich K. Roepke,Anne Decourchelle,Ivo R. Seitenzahl,Daniel Patnaude*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates double-degenerate progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae using 3D simulations from Pakmor et al. (2022), extending them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase. It highlights signatures such as a conical shadow caused by the companion WD and a nested explosion scenario where secondary WD detonation alters inner ejecta dynamics, leaving observable X-ray signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve uncertainties in Type Ia supernova progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms by studying the long-term remnants of double degenerate systems undergoing double detonation. The focus is on observable signatures (like conical shadows and nested explosions) that can distinguish these models from others.

Method: Extended 3D supernova simulations (from Pakmor et al. 2022) into the SNR phase over 1500 years. Analyzed the impact of a companion WD creating a conical shadow in ejecta and the nested explosion scenario where both WDs detonate. Examined morphological features and X-ray emissivity changes due to secondary ejecta interaction with reverse shocks.

Result: Confirmed the persistent conical shadow in ejecta caused by the companion WD, visible as rings, ellipses, or bars depending on orientation. Identified a nested explosion scenario where secondary WD detonation enhances inner ejecta density and compositional uniqueness at collision points, detectable via X-ray spectroscopy.

Conclusion: Double degenerate systems with double detonation leave distinct SNR signatures (conical shadows and inner ejecta anomalies) observable in young SNRs. X-ray observations can test these models, aiding in resolving progenitor and explosion mechanism debates in Type Ia SNe.

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of white
dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms are
still unclear. Here we focus on double degenerate systems, where two WDs are
interacting, and on the double detonation mechanism, where a detonation of a
helium shell triggers a detonation of the carbon-oxygen core of the primary WD.
We take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022
(arXiv:2203.14990) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until
1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the
SNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence
induces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection
with the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a
bar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion
model, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also
explode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer
ejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The
secondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the
density and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact
is peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta.
This effect can be probed with spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of young
SNRs.

### [52] [AT2025ulz and S250818k: zooming in with the Hubble Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18854)

Castro-Tirado,Camila Angulo-Valdez,Josefa Becerra González,José A. Font,Ori Fox,Lei Hu,Youdong Hu,William H. Lee,Margarita Pereyra,Alicia M. Sintes,Alan M. Watson,López Mendoza K. Océlotl C*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: AT2025ulz, initially considered a potential kilonova candidate due to its young age and rapid decline, was observed with GTC and HST. Its rapid onset and brightness exceed typical kilonova models, especially given the low chirp mass of the GW source. HST data places it in a star-forming galaxy with a blue color inconsistent with kilonovae. The transient is better classified as a supernova showing shock-cooling and photospheric phases, supported by spectral features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AT2025ulz, detected alongside a gravitational wave candidate, is a kilonova or another transient type, addressing discrepancies in its observed properties against expected kilonova characteristics.

Method: Multi-wavelength observations using GTC and HST to analyze light curves, colors, and spectra; comparison with kilonova models and supernova classifications; host galaxy analysis via HST imagery.

Result: AT2025ulz exhibits properties inconsistent with most kilonova models (early brightening, mismatched ejecta mass with GW chirp mass, blue color). Spectral features and host galaxy context align with a supernova explanation, specifically a shock-cooling followed by photospheric phase event.

Conclusion: The transient is classified as a supernova rather than a kilonova. This challenges the initial kilonova hypothesis and highlights the need for refined models accommodating extreme cases or alternative interpretations of GW sources.

Abstract: AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up
of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age
($\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr
classify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the
results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio
Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time
evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset
($\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\sim5$ brighter
than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of
our kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred
ejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\lesssim\!0.87\!$
M$_{\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a
nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a
color ($F336W-F160W\!\approx\!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a
kilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova,
initially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric
phase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features.

### [53] [Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18867)
*Anarya Ray,Vicky Kalogera*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GWTC-4 data shows no evidence of a sharp drop-off in BBH masses near 40-50 M☉. A significant fraction (52%) of high-mass systems have mass ratios between 0.6-1. Alternative formation scenarios, rather than hierarchical 2G+1G systems, better explain the results. Simulations suggest (2G+2G) contributions are insufficient to resolve discrepancies. Constraints on Pair-Instability Supernova cutoff and carbon-alpha fusion reactions are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether the pair-instability gap (PIGap) exists in the high-mass end of BBHs. The study aims to determine formation mechanisms, particularly challenging hierarchical models like 2G+1G.

Method: Flexible parametrized models were used to analyze GWTC-4 data, allowing nonparametric exploration of mass, mass ratio, and spin distributions. Compared such distributions against star cluster simulations.

Result: No sharp PIGap below ~57 M☉. High-mass BBHs have significant population (52% ± uncertainties) with mass ratios 0.6-1. Simulations indicate insufficient (2G+2G) systems to align with data. Model assumptions can bias results.

Conclusion: Discrepancies with hierarchical formation models suggest alternative formation pathways. PISN cutoff lower bound constrained to ~57 M☉, implying implications for S-factor of carbon-alpha fusion at 300 keV. Larger datasets may clarify PIGap presence.

Abstract: The fourth gravitational wave transient catalog~(GWTC-4) has enabled
empirical probes of the theorized pair-instability gap in the higher end of the
binary black hole~(BBH) mass-spectrum. In this letter, using flexibly
parametrized models, we show that at present there is no evidence of a sharp
drop-off in the spectrum of black hole masses near $~40-50M_{\odot}$. We
simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH
mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our
flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio
distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a
significant fraction~($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the
range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G
hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are
more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the
predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions
from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We
also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference,
which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors.
We note that our results do not exclude that a high-mass gap may be identified
as our sample size increases. We constrain the lower bound on the location of a
possible PISN cutoff still allowed within measurement uncertainties to be
$(57^{+17}_{-10}M_{\odot})$ and discuss its implications on the S factor of
$^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}O$ at 300 kev.

### [54] [Influence of Fermionic Dark Matter on the Structural and Tidal Properties of Neutron Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17905)
*Monmoy Molla,Masum Murshid,Mehedi Kalam*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how incorporating dark matter (DM) into neutron star (NS) models affects observable properties using different DM mass fractions, particle masses, and normal matter equations of state. It finds significant dependencies on these parameters but notes that current observations weakly constrain these properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between dark matter and dense nuclear matter in neutron stars and to constrain DM properties using astrophysical observations.

Method: Two-fluid framework combining realistic nuclear EOS with an ideal Fermi gas DM EOS. Systematic analysis of NS properties with varying DM mass fraction (f), DM particle mass (μ), and stiffness of normal matter EOS.

Result: Observable NS properties (mass, radius, etc.) deviate from pure matter models depending on f, μ, and normal matter EOS stiffness. Current observational data provides weak constraints on DM admixed NS parameters.

Conclusion: Dark matter admixed neutron stars offer a potential avenue to probe DM properties, but stronger observational constraints are needed to better understand their nature.

Abstract: The inclusion of dark matter (DM) in the modeling of neutron stars (NSs)
provides important information about the properties of DM and the nature of
dense matter. Using some normal matter realistic equation of states (EOSs)with
ideal Fermi gas DM EOS in a two-fluid framework, we systematically investigate
the observable properties of dark matter-admixed neutron stars with an
arbitrary dark matter mass fraction (f) and dark matter particle mass ($\mu$).
It has been observed that the deviations of these observable properties from
pure normal matter behavior depend significantly on the amount of f,$\mu$
value, and stiffness of normal matter EOS. Furthermore, it has been noted that
the properties of dark matter admixed neutron stars are weakly constrained with
recent observational constraints.

Abstract: We use an approximation of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli potential, known as
P\"{o}schl-Teller, to exactly compute the time-domain Green function of black
hole perturbations in this simplified model, taking into account all causality
conditions. We find the existence of an additional early times piece in the
Green function, contributing to new exponentially growing modes just before the
signal interacts with the maximum of the potential. The waveform itself is
decomposed as an instantaneous piece traveling exactly on the light-cones of
the Green function and a historical piece depending on the past trajectory of
the system inside the light-cone. We also study redshift modes and show that
the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli Green function is regular at their frequency, with no
zero nor pole.

### [56] [Amplification of new physics in the quasinormal mode spectrum of highly-rotating black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17962)
*Pablo A. Cano,Marina David,Guido van der Velde*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action significantly alter the quasinormal mode spectrum of near-extremal Kerr black holes, particularly affecting the phase boundary between regions with coexisting zero-damping and damped modes. This offers a novel method to detect gravitational physics beyond GR through black hole spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how small higher-derivative terms in quantum gravity corrections can lead to measurable effects in black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs), since current GR predictions fail to account for certain astrophysical observations and theoretical inconsistencies.

Method: The authors analyze the spectrum of near-extremal Kerr black holes, focusing on the transition point (critical μ ≈ 0.744) where damped modes (DMs) disappear. They calculate sensitivity of modes near this boundary to higher-derivative terms, showing corrections inversely proportional to their distance from the boundary. Exact analysis of phase boundaries for lower (l,m) modes is performed to identify which modes are most sensitive.

Result: The critical ratio μ_cr shifts due to higher-derivative corrections, altering the number of DMs and causing significant modifications (order-one effects) in the QNM spectrum. These effects occur within valid higher-derivative expansions, making highly-rotating black holes' ringdowns the most promising probe for detecting new physics.

Conclusion: Black hole spectroscopy, especially of rapidly-rotating holes, provides the most powerful observational method to search forBeyond-GR effects in gravitational wave signals via QNM analysis. The phase boundary's sensitivity to modifications highlights the importance of studying near-critical modes for testing gravity theories.

Abstract: We show that perturbatively-small higher-derivative corrections to the
Einstein-Hilbert action can lead to order-one modifications of the quasinormal
mode spectrum of near-extremal Kerr black holes. The spectrum of such black
holes contains zero-damping modes (ZDMs) and damped modes (DMs), with the
latter only existing when the ratio $\mu=m/(l+1/2)$ is below a critical value
$\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}\approx 0.744$. Thus, this value represents a "phase
boundary" that separates a region with both ZDMs and DMs and a region with only
ZDMs. We find that the modes lying close to the phase boundary are very
sensitive to modifications of GR, as their lifetimes receive corrections
inversely proportional to their distance to the boundary. We link this growth
of the corrections to a modification of the critical point $\bar{\mu}_{\rm
cr}$, which can lead to a change in the number of DMs and produce order-one
effects in the spectrum. We show that these large effects can take place in a
regime in which the higher-derivative expansion remains under control. We also
perform an exact analysis of the modification of the phase boundary for lower
$(l,m)$ modes and pinpoint those that are most sensitive to corrections. Our
results indicate that spectroscopy of highly-rotating black holes is by far the
most powerful way to search for new physics in ringdown signals.

*Fabrizio Corelli,Paolo Pani,Andrea P. Sanna*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Combining f(R) gravity and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity creates a new gravitational theory with two nonminimally coupled scalar fields, offering nonperturbative insights. It modifies black holes with f(R) effects while retaining EdGB features like minimum mass, but fails to resolve the theory's ill-posedness despite quartic corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify consistent theories with higher-curvature terms at the nonperturbative level, beyond effective field theory approaches. Prior theories (f(R), EdGB) have limitations: f(R) preserves GR's solutions but EdGB faces well-posedness issues in strong coupling.

Method: Merging f(R) and EdGB gravities into a new framework outside Horndeski's class. Analyzes quadratic and quartic curvature corrections, examining black hole solutions' structure and properties.

Result: The combined theory produces modified black holes with f(R) effects, preserves EdGB features (minimum mass, multiple branches), suppresses Ricci scalar divergence in interiors, but retains problematic singularity/elliptic regions, indicating unresolved ill-posedness.

Conclusion: Adding higher-order terms alone can't resolve the theory's nonperturbative ill-posedness. Future tests require studying nonlinear dynamics governed by second-order equations.

Abstract: General Relativity is expected to break down in the high-curvature regime.
Beyond an effective field theory treatment with higher-order operators, it is
important to identify consistent theories with higher-curvature terms at the
nonperturbative level. Two well-studied examples are $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity
and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same
vacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter
suffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the
strong-coupling regime. We show that combining these two theories leads to
genuinely new phenomena beyond their simple superposition. The resulting
framework falls outside Horndeski's class, as it can be recast as a
gravitational theory involving two nonminimally coupled scalar fields with
nontrivial mutual interactions. This construction naturally extends EdGB
gravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile
setting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic
corrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\mathcal{R})$
terms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting
solutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes
with certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a
nontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the
black-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity
structure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of
pure EdGB gravity. This suggests that, at the nonperturbative level, the
theory's ill-posedness cannot be resolved by adding individual higher-order
terms. This conjecture could be tested by studying the nonlinear dynamics,
which remains governed by second-order field equations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard
Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions
near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if
sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on
gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe
of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic
waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical
relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on
scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are
included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with
$\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to
the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a singularity-free bouncing universe model using de Broglie-Bohm quantum mechanics, compatible with Planck data, and suggests it could help resolve the Hubble tension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the initial singularity problem in the Big Bang cosmology and explore quantum gravitational effects near the bounce to explain cosmic observations like the H₀-σ₈ tension.

Method: Using the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation to derive deterministic scale factor trajectories through a quantum bounce, calculating the primordial power spectrum with bounce-induced modulations, and comparing with Planck 2018 CMB data.

Result: The model is strongly compatible with Planck data; sets an upper limit on the bounce scale k_B, and predicts an anti-correlation between spectral index and perturbation amplitude that could alleviate the H₀-σ₈ tension.

Conclusion: Quantum gravitational effects via de Broglie-Bohm mechanics can resolve cosmic singularities while aligning with observations, offering a testable framework for future surveys to address cosmological tensions.

Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm
of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is
resolved via the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which
provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum
bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived,
incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by
the non-standard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront
this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing
its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent
upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce, $k_B$, constraining the
parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. Furthermore, the
model's specific scale-dependent anti-correlation between the spectral index
and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the
$H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future
cosmological surveys.

*Dario Olmos Cayo,Zui Oporto Almaraz,M. L. Peñafiel*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the stability of thin shells in (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes with inner AdS and outer charged BTZ regions, finding that Maxwell-BTZ shells have broader dynamic stability and combined thermo-dynamic stability regions compared to BI-BTZ shells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how non-linear electrodynamics (via Born-Infeld vs Maxwell theories) affects the stability properties of thin-shell configurations in lower-dimensional gravity models.

Method: Used dynamical equations with linear equation of state for shell matter, parametrization analysis for stability, and derived thermodynamic quantities like entropy to analyze both dynamic and thermodynamic stability conditions.

Result: Maxwell-BTZ shells show wider dynamic stability ranges. Thermodynamic stability regions overlap more in BI-BTZ (all thermally stable ones are dynamically stable when extremal), while Maxwell-BTZ has separate regions. BI-BTZ linear-state shells are always dynamically stable.

Conclusion: Highlights the role of electromagnetic theory type in shell stability, showing Maxwell allows more flexibility, and provides foundational insights into 3D gravity systems with nonlinear electrodynamics interactions.

Abstract: We study the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of thin shells in
(2+1)-dimensional spacetimes composed of an inner anti-de Sitter (AdS) region
and an outer region described by a charged Ba\~nados--Teitelboim--Zanelli (BTZ)
spacetime, sourced either by Einstein--Maxwell theory (Maxwell-BTZ) or
Einstein--Born--Infeld theory (BI-BTZ). Assuming a fixed charge-to-mass ratio
and modeling the shell's matter with a linear equation of state, we introduce a
convenient parametrization to analyze the dynamical stability configurations.
We find that Maxwell-BTZ thin shells admit a wider range of dynamically stable
configurations compared to BI-BTZ thin shells. We also derive the
thermodynamics of the shell matter, obtaining physically meaningful entropy
functions in both cases, and examine the conditions for thermodynamical
stability. In the Maxwell-BTZ case, we identify regions in the parameter space
where configurations are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable. In
contrast, for extremal BI-BTZ thin shells, all thermodynamically stable
configurations are contained within the dynamically stable ones, and shells
with a linear equation of state are always dynamically stable. This work
extends the understanding of thin shell configurations in lower-dimensional
gravity and elucidates the interplay between dynamics, thermodynamics, and
nonlinear electrodynamics.

### [61] [Quasilocal inequalities for attractive gravity probe surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18202)
*Tetsuya Shiromizu,Keisuke Izumi,Hirotaka Yoshino,Yoshimune Tomikawa*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines local and quasilocal properties of loosely trapped surfaces (LTS) and attractive gravity probe surfaces (AGPS), using mean curvature to assess gravity strength. New inequalities involving local mass, Geroch quasilocal mass, and area/size relationships are derived. Enhanced concepts LTS+ and AGPS+ are introduced, based on null geodesic congruence expansions, with similar inequalities proven using Hawking quasilocal mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of gravity characterization in both strong and weak fields by refining surface-based measures (LTS/AGPS) and deriving mass/area inequalities, utilizing quasilocal mass definitions for more accurate gravitational strength analysis.

Method: 1. Analyze local/quasilocal properties of LTS and AGPS using mean curvature. 2. Define local mass within regions bounded by AGPS and apply Geroch quasilocal mass to derive inequalities. 3. Introduce LTS+ and AGPS+ by incorporating expansions of outgoing/ingoing null geodesic congruences. 4. Formulate and prove analogous inequalities using Hawking quasilocal mass.

Result: Derived novel inequalities connecting local mass, quasilocal masses (Geroch/Hawking), and geometrical properties (size/area) of LTS/AGPS surfaces. Validated the improved LTS+/AGPS+ concepts through proven inequalities, enhancing applicability in gravitational studies.

Conclusion: The enhanced LTS+/AGPS+ concepts provide superior tools for assessing gravitational strength across various field strengths. The established mass/area inequalities offer foundational insights for further investigations into quasilocal energy properties and gravitational dynamics.

Abstract: We discuss the local and quasilocal properties of the loosely trapped surface
(LTS) and the attractive gravity probe surface (AGPS), which have been proposed
to characterize the strength of gravity in both strong and weak gravity regions
using the mean curvature. In terms of local mass defined in a region surrounded
by the two AGPSs and of Geroch quasilocal mass, we present several inequalities
concerning their size and area, which are of particular interest. We also
propose the improved concepts of the LTS/AGPS, which we call LTS Plus (LTS+)
and AGPS Plus (AGPS$+$), defined in terms of expansions of outgoing and ingoing
null geodesic congruences on those surfaces. Then, the similar inequalities are
proven in terms of appropriately defined local mass and the Hawking quasilocal
mass.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work presents and investigates novel traversable wormhole solutions
within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity (ASG), sourced by a dark
matter halo modeled by the Dekel--Zhao density profile. The scale-dependent
gravitational coupling $G(k)$, derived from the ASG renormalization group flow
in the infrared regime, is incorporated directly into the field equations,
providing a consistent description of quantum gravitational corrections even at
astrophysical scales. The combined effects of the running coupling
(parameterized by $\xi$) and the dark matter characteristics determine the
geometric structure and physical viability of the wormhole. The solutions
satisfy the flare-out and asymptotic flatness conditions within restricted
parameter domains, exhibiting enhanced curvature near the throat due to ASG
corrections. Null Energy Conditions are necessarily violated at the throat, and
stability analysis based on the adiabatic sound speed as well as the modified
Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equation reveal that quantum effects from ASG
counteract the destabilizing influence of dark matter. Phenomenologically, the
wormhole shadow radius increases nearly linearly with $\xi$, lying within the
Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A$^*$ when $\xi/M \simeq 0.8--0.9$, thus
suggesting that ASG-corrected wormholes may represent observable signatures of
quantum gravity in the strong-field regime.

*Jonathan Barenboim,Andrei V. Frolov,Gabor Kunstatter*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper derives the Hamiltonian for 2D semi-classical dilaton gravity, leading to a generalized Brown-York quasi-local mass function. It shows that the Bondi mass includes a classical mass plus a frame-dependent correction, which is non-increasing and stays positive in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand mass definitions in semi-classical 2D dilaton gravity and their behavior under different boundary conditions, exploring the transition between ADM and Bondi masses through frame transformations.

Method: Deriving the Hamiltonian from the complete action including Polyakov and Gibbons-Hawking-York terms, calculating mass functions, and analyzing Bondi mass's frame transformation properties via numerical simulations.

Result: Bondi mass equals classical mass plus a non-increasing, positive correction term. ADM and Bondi masses are recovered in respective limits, confirming consistency with known physics.

Conclusion: The derived Hamiltonian framework successfully links quasi-local mass definitions in 2D dilaton gravity, validates energy conditions via simulations, and supports the robustness of mass definitions under inertial frame changes.

Abstract: We derive the Hamiltonian for general semi-classical 2D dilaton gravity,
beginning with the com- plete action including the Polyakov action and
Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. The value of the Hamiltonian yields a
generalized Brown-York quasi-local mass function, and the ADM and Bondi masses
are obtained in the appropriate limits. The Bondi mass is equal to the
classical mass plus a correction term given by the transformation between
initial and final inertial frames. It is non-increasing and remains positive in
numerical simulations.

### [64] [Spontaneous scalarization of regular Hayward black holes in Einstein-nonlinear electromagnetic-scalar gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18354)
*Lan-Lan Cai,Meng-Yun Lai,De-Cheng Zou,Lina Zhang,Hyat Huang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores spontaneous scalarization of Hayward black holes with tachyonic instability in a specific gravity model, generating scalarized charged black holes (SCBHs) with quadratic and exponential couplings. These SCBHs are categorized based on excitation numbers, with the fundamental (n=0) branch being stable against radial perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Hayward black holes undergo spontaneous scalarization under tachyonic instability in Einstein-nonlinear electromagnetic-scalar gravity, leading to the formation of SCBHs and their stability properties.

Method: The authors derive SCBHs with quadratic (1−αφ²) and exponential (e^−αφ²) couplings, analyze their excitation states (n=0,1,2,...), and assess stability through radial perturbation analysis.

Result: Stable fundamental SCBHs (n=0) exist for both coupling models; excited states (n≥1) were identified but their stability isn’t confirmed here. The stable n=0 branch is viable for observational studies.

Conclusion: The stable fundamental SCBHs offer a promising avenue for testing theoretical models against astronomical observations, particularly in electromagnetic-gravity interactions.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the spontaneous scalarization of Hayward black
holes in Einstein-nonlinear electromagnetic-scalar gravity. Taking into account
the tachyonic instability, we obtain scalarized charged black holes (SCBHs)
with quadratic (1-$\alpha\varphi^2$) and exponential ($e^{-\alpha \varphi^2}$)
couplings, respectively. Moreover, these SCBHs can be labelled by the number of
$n = 0, 1, 2,...$, where $n = 0$ is called the fundamental black hole and $n =
1, 2,...$ denote the $n$-excited black holes. We recover that the $n = 0$
branch for both couplings is stable against radial perturbations. This
stability shows that this branch can be used for further observational
implications.

### [65] [Causality as a guiding principle for physics beyond General Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18419)
*Gerardo García-Moreno*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This thesis explores quantum gravity through the lens of emergent theories inspired by condensed matter physics, focusing on how causal structure and geometry emerge from underlying degrees of freedom. It provides a conceptual roadmap divided into two parts: one examining foundational aspects of background structures and another analyzing singularity-free scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in quantum gravity by adopting an emergent framework where gravitational features emerge from more fundamental components, avoiding the complications of direct quantization of gravity. This approach leverages insights from condensed matter physics to offer a flexible conceptual framework.

Method: The work employs a conceptual and analytical approach rather than developing a specific model. It examines fundamental principles such as background independence and explores implications of singularity-free geometries, using theoretical reflections rather than detailed model-based computations.

Result: The thesis constructs a structured roadmap for emergent gravity theories, clarifying the role of background structures and their impact on both the conceptual foundations and constructive aspects of such theories. It also highlights the viability of singularity-free frameworks without dependence on specific models.

Conclusion: Emergent approaches provide a promising path in quantum gravity research by redefining the conceptual basis of spacetime. The analysis underscores the importance of background structures and the potential of singularity-free models, encouraging further exploration within this agnostic, model-independent framework.

Abstract: This thesis is situated within the context of quantum gravity, broadly
understood as any effort to explore the interplay between gravitation and the
quantum realm, without necessarily requiring the quantization of the
gravitational field itself. We focus on emergent theories, particularly those
in which the causal structure and geometric concepts underlying the
gravitational field in General Relativity are not fundamental but instead arise
from more basic underlying degrees of freedom. Our attention is directed toward
emergent approaches inspired by condensed matter physics. Rather than
developing a full-fledged emergent theory and analyzing its detailed
consequences, this work offers a concise roadmap of analyses and reflections
relevant to emergent frameworks, without committing to any specific model. The
thesis is divided into two parts, reflecting the distinct tools and analyses
employed in each. The first addresses fundamental and conceptual aspects of
emergent theories, focusing on the role of background structures, both
regarding their implications for the theory and their constructive relevance.
The second assumes the absence of singularities and horizons, a feature often
expected in emergent frameworks, though the analyses remain agnostic and
independent of specific theoretical commitments.

*J. François,L. Ravera*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a model using the Dressing Field Method (DFM) to study galaxy dynamics in a general-relativistic framework with scalar fields, generating rotation curves that mimic Dark Matter effects, fitting observed spiral galaxy data from SPARC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant approach to galaxy dynamics that could explain rotation curves without explicitly invoking Dark Matter.

Method: Application of the Dressing Field Method to a system with metric and four scalar fields representing a cosmological fluid, deriving gauge-invariant physical coordinatization which introduces corrective velocity terms.

Result: DFM-derived rotation curves combine Keplerian and constant velocity components, matching observed spiral galaxy data from SPARC database effectively, suggesting alternative explanation to Dark Matter.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates that gauge-invariant content from general relativistic theories using DFM can account for galaxy rotation dynamics traditionally attributed to Dark Matter, offering a new perspective without explicit Dark Matter inclusion.

Abstract: We present a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant simple model of galaxy
dynamics obtained by applying the Dressing Field Method (DFM) to a
general-relativistic system comprising the metric and four scalar fields,
phenomenologically representing the four-velocity of a cosmological fluid or
dust field. The DFM, a systematic tool for extracting the gauge-invariant
content in general-relativistic theories, provides a physical coordinatization
that yields corrective terms to the rotational velocity profile. These
corrections produce galaxy rotation curves that combine a Keplerian and a
constant velocity terms, effectively emulating a Dark Matter contribution. We
compare DFM-derived rotation curves to observed data for spiral galaxies, from
the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database, showing
that the DFM allows to fit them well.

### [67] [Observational Tests of Regular Black Holes with Scalar Hair and their Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18647)
*P. A. González,Marco Olivares,Eleftherios Papantonopoulos,Yerko Vásquez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the geodesic structure and observable properties of asymptotically flat regular black holes with a phantom scalar field parameter A. Classical Solar System tests and strong-field analyses (Lyapunov exponent, shadow size) constrain A to be very small, maintaining consistency with general relativity. Event Horizon Telescope data on M87* and Sgr A* provide additional constraints, showing A's observational impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the scalar charge A, which removes the central singularity and modifies Schwarzschild geometry, affects observable properties of black holes, ensuring consistency with both weak-field tests and strong-field observations.

Method: Deriving and analyzing equations of motion for test particles and photons; calculating deflection, time delay, redshift in weak-field regime; computing Lyapunov exponent, critical impact parameter, and shadow size in strong-field regime; applying Solar System constraints and EHT observations.

Result: A must be extremely small to align with Solar System tests. Strong-field analysis reveals exact relations between Lyapunov exponent, critical impact parameter, and shadow size. Increased A reduces photon trajectory instability and enlarges shadow, with EHT data further constraining A.

Conclusion: The scalar charge A leaves distinct observational imprints on black hole geometry, with tight empirical constraints ensuring consistency between the model and astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We study the geodesic structure and observable properties of asymptotically
flat regular black holes sourced by a phantom scalar field characterized by a
scalar charge $A$. This parameter removes the central singularity and
continuously deforms the Schwarzschild geometry. The equations of motion for
test particles and photons are derived, and the resulting null geodesics are
analyzed, including the deflection of light, gravitational time delay, and
redshift, in order to constrain $A$ using classical Solar System tests. These
observations impose stringent limits on the scalar charge, confirming that $A$
must remain extremely small in the weak-field regime to ensure full consistency
with general relativity. In the strong-field regime, we compute the Lyapunov
exponent $\lambda$ associated with the photon sphere and establish its exact
relations with the critical impact parameter $\mathcal{B}_u$ and the angular
size of the shadow $\alpha_{\mathrm{sh}}$, given by $\mathcal{B}_u =
1/|\lambda|$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{sh}} = 1/(r_{0}|\lambda|)$. These
correspondences reveal that the dynamical instability of null circular orbits
governs the optical appearance of the black hole. Our results show that
increasing $A$ reduces the instability of photon trajectories and enlarges the
angular size of the shadow, indicating that the regularization scale leaves a
distinct observational imprint on the geometry of regular black holes. In
addition, constraints derived from Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*
and Sgr A* further restrict the allowed range of the scalar charge, reinforcing
the consistency of the model with current astrophysical observations.

### [68] [Comprehensive analysis of dissipative effects in the induced gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18663)
*Yan-Heng Yu,Zhe Chang,Sai Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates dissipative effects on induced gravitational waves, identifying characteristic features like a double-valley structure and modified infrared behavior, with implications for detecting new physics through gravitational-wave experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dissipation in the cosmic fluid affects gravitational waves generated by curvature perturbations (IGWs), which can probe early Universe physics and potential new particles.

Method: Analytical modeling of dissipative effects in IGW spectra, focusing on scales around the decoupling horizon and their impact on spectral features, supplemented by exploration of non-Gaussianity effects.

Result: Dissipation creates a 'double-valley' suppression peak and alters infrared behavior in IGW spectra; neutrino-induced effects are relevant for pulsar timing arrays; new particles' dissipation could be detected by diverse gravitational-wave observatories.

Conclusion: Dissipative effects offer a realistic framework for IGWs, providing observational signatures to probe high-energy physics and early Universe dynamics via gravitational wave experiments.

Abstract: Dissipation is an intrinsic property of the cosmic fluid, leading to the
damping of curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we
comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by
curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find
dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim
k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds
to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They
can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable
suppression with a ``double-valley'' structure at $k \sim
k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without
logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the
Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at
the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing
array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible
new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of
gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at
extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative
effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the
anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects
not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich
phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into
understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.

### [69] [Decay of uniformly rotating particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18670)
*Luciano Petruzziello,Martin B. Plenio*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper revisits the circular Unruh effect by applying general covariance principles to non-inertial particle decay, showing that the inverse-β process tree-level decay rate doesn't need a thermal bath for coordinate invariance. It interprets decay as emission of negative-energy quanta, implying uniformly rotating particles aren't stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve inconsistencies in the interpretation of the circular Unruh effect by ensuring decay rates transform covariantly without requiring artificial thermal baths for rotating observers.

Method: Applied general covariance to analyze scalar field inverse-β decay processes at tree level, examining how negative-energy quanta emission maintains coordinate invariance without external baths.

Result: Demonstrated decay rates remain scalar under coordinate transformations without thermal baths; showed all uniformly rotating particles are fundamentally unstable due to negative-energy emissions.

Conclusion: The absence of a global vacuum for rotating observers necessitates viewing decay as negative-energy emission, fundamentally linking particle instability to non-inertial motion in curved spacetime.

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the interpretation of the circular Unruh effect. To
this aim, we rely on the principle of general covariance applied to the decay
properties of non-inertial particles. Specifically, we show how the tree-level
decay rate of an inverse-$\beta$ process involving scalar fields does not
require the introduction of a thermal (or non-thermal) bath in the comoving
frame to be a scalar under general coordinate transformations. Instead, we
interpret any decay process as an emission of negative-energy quanta, whose
existence is motivated by the absence of a global vacuum state for uniformly
rotating observers. This implies that, in principle, no uniformly rotating
particle can be regarded as stable.

Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of cosmological black holes by
analyzing the properties of trapping horizons in detail, based on Hayward's
formalism of future outer and past inner trapping horizons, in several
dynamical spacetimes embedded in an expanding universe. Through a detailed
examination of the McVittie, Culetu, and Sultana--Dyer metrics, as well as the
generalized Glass--Mashhoon solution, we evaluate the existence and
characteristics of trapping horizons and energy conditions. The Glass--Mashhoon
solution provides an analytical model for spherical stellar collapse. However,
it is shown that, as long as certain conditions are satisfied, it lacks
suitable future outer trapping horizons, meaning it does not represent a
cosmological black hole. As a result, the McVittie class of solutions also
fails to describe a cosmological black hole. Conversely, the Culetu and
Sultana--Dyer spacetimes can describe a cosmological black hole in the
matter-dominated early universe, provided that the relevant energy conditions
are satisfied.

### [71] [Analysis of observables in FLRW spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18747)
*P. Fernandez de Cordoba,S. Gavasso,J. M. Isidro*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the idea of modeling a positively curved FLRW universe's cosmological fluid using the probability fluid of a nonrelativistic quantum particle. By quantizing the spacetime geometry and computing quantum expectation values, the authors investigate the cosmological constant and gravitational entropy in such a quantum framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge quantum mechanics and cosmology by interpreting cosmological fluids through quantum probability distributions. This approach aims to provide insights into the nature of dark matter, the cosmological constant problem, and entropy in a curved spacetime context.

Method: The method involves using the Schroedinger equation in a FLRW spacetime background with a Hamiltonian proportional to the Laplacian derived from the metric. Radially symmetric quantum eigenstates are calculated to compute expectation values for the cosmological constant and gravitational entropy.

Result: The authors derive matrix elements and expectation values for the cosmological constant and entropy within their quantum model. This framework provides a quantum mechanical interpretation of macroscopic cosmological parameters and entropy in a curved universe.

Conclusion: The study suggests that quantum mechanical formalism can be applied to cosmological models by treating the universe's fluid as a quantum probability fluid. This approach offers a novel perspective on dark matter and cosmological constants, hinting at deeper connections between quantum theory and gravity.

Abstract: We consider a positively curved FLRW spacetime as a background in which a
nonrelativistic quantum particle propagates according to the Schroedinger
equation. The probability fluid for the corresponding quantum states is taken
as a model for the cosmological fluid filling this FLRW Universe. The
Hamiltonian operator governing this fictitious particle is proportional to the
Laplacian operator derived from the FLRW metric, while the mass of the particle
equals the overall matter of the Universe (baryonic and dark). A complete,
orthonormal set of quantum eigenstates of the Hamiltonian is obtained.
Restricting to radially symmetric states, the latter are then used to compute
matrix elements and expectation values of two observables for which quantum
operators are identified, namely, the cosmological constant and the
gravitational Boltzmann entropy. This entropy is regarded as corresponding to a
positively-curved FLRW geometry when the cosmological fluid filling the
Universe occupies a given quantum state.

*Reinosuke Kusano,Keith Horne,Friedrich Koenig,Miguel Yulo Asuncion*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study explores null matter accumulation at stable photon spheres in the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, a conformal gravity analog of Schwarzschild. Using an infinitely-thin shell model, it finds induced pressure jumps except at photon sphere radii. Loading the stable photon sphere preserves its area and, at a critical threshold, generates an extremal horizon with AdS₂×S² geometry, independent of cosmological curvature—an unexpected outcome not seen in standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate unique phenomena in conformal gravity by analyzing null matter dynamics at photon spheres in the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, potentially revealing properties unseen in classical Einstein gravity scenarios.

Method: Examined an infinitely-thin null matter shell in the Mannheim-Kazanas spacetime, calculating stress-energy tensor jumps across the shell. Analyzed conditions for pressure discontinuities and critical loading thresholds leading to extremal horizons.

Result: Discovered that radial pressure jumps occur except at photon sphere radii; stable photon sphere area remains constant under loading. At critical loading, formed an extremal AdS₂×S² horizon independent of cosmological parameters.

Conclusion: Demonstrates novel behaviors in conformal gravity, showing how null matter interactions can produce unexpected geometries like cosmological-constant-independent extremal horizons, highlighting conformal gravity's distinct predictions from Einstein's theory.

Abstract: We investigate the accumulation of null matter at the stable photon sphere in
the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, the analogue to the Schwarzschild solution in
Weyl's conformal theory of gravity. In our toy problem in which we consider an
infinitely-thin shell, we find that a jump in radial pressure ${T^r}_r$ is
induced across the shell unless the shell has a radius of either the unstable
or stable photon sphere radii. We then find that upon loading the stable photon
sphere, its area remains invariant. Furthermore, at a critical threshold
loading limit for this zero-width null matter shell, we are able to produce a
metric containing an extremal horizon with an AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ geometry
completely independent of the cosmological curvature. This hitherto
unencountered and therefore unexpected result is a phenomenon unseen in
standard nonconformal second-order metrics with nonzero cosmological constants.

### [73] [Can black holes evaporate past extremality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18839)
*Samuel E. Gralla*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the fate of evaporating charged black holes, proposing that instead of forming a singularity, the collapsing matter either forms a timelike singularity or re-emerges as a null shell, potentially resolving information paradox issues without requiring quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the information paradox and the final fate of black holes undergoing Hawking evaporation, particularly whether singularities form or alternative outcomes occur when black holes evaporate to near-extremal states.

Method: Uses a charged Vaidya spacetime model with a flat interior, simulating black hole evaporation through ingoing null flux. Analyzes two scenarios based on initial shell binding: tightly bound shells leading to timelike singularities, and unbound/less bound shells resulting in null shell remnants.

Result: Two outcomes are found: tightly bound shells form visible timelike singularities, while others expel a null shell carrying Hawking radiation correlations. This avoids strong curvature requiring quantum gravity, even for Planck-scale evaporation.

Conclusion: Proposes a new interior dynamics model where matter settles on an outgoing null trajectory inside the horizon during evaporation, potentially resolving information loss paradox without needing quantum gravity effects.

Abstract: Black holes with sufficiently large initial charge and mass will
Hawking-evaporate towards the extremal limit. The emission slows as the
temperature approaches zero, but still reaches the point where a single Hawking
quantum would make the object superextremal, removing the horizon. We take this
semiclassical prediction at face value and ask: When the emission occurs, what
is revealed? Using a model of thin-shell collapse with subsequent
accretion/evaporation by a null flux of ingoing positive/negative energy
(charged Vaidya spacetime glued to a flat interior), we find two possible
outcomes: (i) For shells that are initially very tightly bound, a timelike
singularity forms and later appears; or (ii) for unbound or modestly bound
shells, the matter re-emerges as a null shell that expands to infinity. This
expanding remnant has been bathed in the ingoing Hawking quanta during
evaporation and presumably carries correlations with the outgoing quanta,
offering the attractive possibility of studying information paradox issues in a
setup where spacetime curvatures are globally small, so that quantum gravity is
not required. Even for ordinary black holes that evaporate down to the Planck
size, we propose a radical new scenario for the interior: rather than forming a
singularity, the collapsing matter settles onto an \textit{outgoing} null
trajectory \textit{inside} the horizon for the entirety of evaporation.

*Diego Ariel Sotelo Carrillo,Omar Pedraza,L. A. López,R. Arceo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines quasi-normal modes of a scalar field in an Ayón-Beato-García black hole with quintessence, using the Asymptotic Iteration Method. It finds that increasing charge parameter g² raises real frequencies and reduces damping, while higher quintessence parameter c decreases both real and imaginary parts. Effects are stronger as ω_q approaches -1, suggesting observational detectability and slower damping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how charge, quintessence parameters affect quasi-normal modes in modified black hole settings, important for understanding gravitational wave signatures and black hole physics in exotic spacetimes.

Method: Applied the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) with 30 iterations to solve the scalar field perturbation equations in the Ayón-Beato-García black hole background with quintessence influence.

Result: Real frequency parts increase with g², imaginary parts' absolute values decrease with g². Both real and imaginary parts decrease with quintessence parameter c. Effects more significant as ω_q nears -1. Quasi-normal frequencies remain finite, implying easier observational detection. Quintessence causes slower damping of perturbations.

Conclusion: Quintessence and charge parameters significantly influence black hole quasi-normal modes, offering insights into black hole properties and potential observational signatures. The finite frequencies and slower damping suggest avenues for future astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We investigate the quasi--normal modes of a massless scalar field in the
background of an Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia black hole surrounded by quintessence,
using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) with $30$ iterations. The results
show that the real part of the frequencies increases with the charge parameter
$g^2$, while the absolute value of the imaginary part decreases as $g^2$
increases. In contrast, both the real part and the absolute value of the
imaginary part decrease as the quintessence parameter $c$ increases. These
trends are observed for both values of the quintessence state parameter,
$\omega_q =-2/3$ and $\omega_q =-4/9$; however, the effects become more
pronounced as $\omega_q$ approaches $-1$. The quasi--normal frequencies tend to
have finite values, which could facilitate their observational detection.
Moreover, the presence of quintessence leads to a slower damping of the
perturbations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework to analyze deviations from Keplerian orbits in astrophysical binaries caused by environmental effects or new physics, focusing on eccentric orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emissions. The approach offers a source-specific modeling strategy to trace the physical origins of deviations, derived from a perturbed potential, and assesses observational relevance for current and future detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study perturbations in binary systems that could stem from environmental influences, modified gravity, or new physics, which may not be adequately captured by traditional parametrized frameworks like post-Newtonian expansions.

Method: Develops a unified perturbed Kepler problem framework starting from a general perturbed potential. Derives modified orbits, gravitational fluxes, and phase evolution, then evaluates their detectability in gravitational wave observations.

Result: The framework provides a general and physically transparent method to analyze subtle deviations in gravitational wave data, enabling better tracing of model parameters' physical origins compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a valuable toolkit for identifying departures from standard dynamics in gravitational wave observations, enhancing interpretability of binary system models and their underlying physics.

Abstract: Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure
Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the
underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work,
we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in
the ambit of the perturbed Kepler problem and explore their impact on eccentric
orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional
parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions,
our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more
natural to trace the physical origins of eccentric binary model parameters.
Starting from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and
compute the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing
their observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This
framework thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit for probing
such subtle deviations from standard dynamics in gravitational wave data.
