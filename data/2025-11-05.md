Abstract: We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing
array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through
the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise
framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on
realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and
stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence
estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of
magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional
single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the
potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while
preserving the quality of the inference.

### [2] [Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA data analysis II: Noise and SGWB inference through parameter decorrelation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01959)
*Eleonora Villa,Luigi D'Amico,Aldo Barca,Fatima Modica Bittordo,Francesco Alì,Massimo Meneghetti,Luca Naso*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian model with orthogonal reparametrization and Normalizing Flows to improve Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) analysis by reducing systematic biases in noise modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PTA analyses use fixed uniform noise priors leading to systematic biases when combining arrays. Accurate gravitational wave detection requires addressing correlated noise parameters and degeneracy between red noise and SGWB parameters.

Method: 1. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling with hyperparameters for noise priors. 2. Orthogonal reparametrization to decorrelate hyperparameters and physical parameters. 3. Normalizing Flows for efficient sampling. 4. i-nessai nested sampler for high-dimensional exploration.

Result: On a 3-pulsar dataset, hierarchical model tightened noise constraints and reduced red noise-SGWB degeneracy. Orthogonal reparametrization improved parameter independence without altering inherent power-law correlations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully mitigates biases in PTA noise modeling, enhancing gravitational wave detection through improved parameter estimation and degeneracy management.

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency
gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged
by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA
analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can
introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this
limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise
priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the
challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise
parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure
variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal
reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows.
We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore
the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a
minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and
SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show
that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly
and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal
reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the
correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes
involved.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: CMB-S4 is the fourth-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background
project, designed to probe the early universe and cosmic inflation. CMB-S4
would achieve its science goals in part by dramatically increasing the number
of transition edge sensor (TES) bolometer detectors on the sky. The detector
readout system for CMB-S4 is time-division multiplexing (TDM) with a two-stage
Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) system. To accommodate the
large increase in detectors, the size of our camera increases, placing physical
constraints on the readout, its wiring, and its power dissipation. Therefore,
to optimize readout performance, we need to balance competing design
considerations such as thermal load and bandwidth. We present results
characterizing the thermal and electrical performance of prototype components,
including wiring and SQUID arrays for CMB-S4, and discuss the impact on overall
system performance.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Astroflow is an end-to-end GPU-accelerated pipeline for fast and efficient real-time detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in radio time-frequency data, achieving 10x faster-than-real-time processing with high sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing FRB discovery rates from next-gen surveys like SKA and MeerKAT require overcoming computational bottlenecks to handle vast data volumes in real-time.

Method: Uses RFI excision, incoherent dedispersion, dynamic-spectrum tiling, and a YOLO-based deep learning detector. Implemented in C++/CUDA with Python interface, utilizing vectorized memory access, shared-memory tiling, and OpenMP parallelism.

Result: Achieves 10x faster-than-real-time processing on consumer GPUs for typical observations, maintaining high sensitivity across pulse widths and dispersion measures.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of scalable GPU-accelerated FRB searches, offering a reusable framework adaptable to future surveys and improved models.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely bright, millisecond duration cosmic
transients of unknown origin. The growing number of wide-field and
high-time-resolution radio surveys, particularly with next-generation
facilities such as the SKA and MeerKAT, will dramatically increase FRB
discovery rates, but also produce data volumes that overwhelm conventional
search pipelines. Real-time detection thus demands software that is both
algorithmically robust and computationally efficient. We present Astroflow, an
end-to-end, GPU-accelerated pipeline for single-pulse detection in radio
time-frequency data. Built on a unified C++/CUDA core with a Python interface,
Astroflow integrates RFI excision, incoherent dedispersion, dynamic-spectrum
tiling, and a YOLO-based deep detector. Through vectorized memory access,
shared-memory tiling, and OpenMP parallelism, it achieves 10x
faster-than-real-time processing on consumer GPUs for a typical 150 s,
2048-channel observation, while preserving high sensitivity across a wide range
of pulse widths and dispersion measures. These results establish the
feasibility of a fully integrated, GPU-accelerated single-pulse search stack,
capable of scaling to the data volumes expected from upcoming large-scale
surveys. Astroflow offers a reusable and deployable solution for real-time
transient discovery, and provides a framework that can be continuously refined
with new data and models.

### [5] [Development of Silicon Micromachined Waveguide Filter-Banks for On-Chip Spectrometers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02756)
*Matthew A. Koc,Jason Austermann,James Beall,Johannes Hubmayr,Joel N. Ullom,Michael Vissers,Jordan Wheeler*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents a metalized Si waveguide filter-bank fabricated with deep reactive ion etching for millimeter spectroscopy, offering high-density pixel packing, high efficiency, and spectral resolution, compatible with MKID arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop high-speed, spatial-mapping spectrometers in millimeter and far-infrared frequencies for advancing research in astronomy and cosmology, addressing the limitation of low optical efficiency in existing devices.

Method: Fabrication of a metalized Si waveguide filter-bank using deep reactive ion etching. Gold-plated test waveguides and filters were created and tested.

Result: The fabricated filters demonstrated a resolving power of 263 and a loss quality factor of 1116 at room temperature, matching simulations well.

Conclusion: The design shows promise for scalable, multi-wavelength applications in spectroscopy, overcoming efficiency issues and paving the way for Line Intensity Mapping.

Abstract: Development of high-speed, spatial-mapping spectrometers in the millimeter
and far-infrared frequencies would enable entirely new research avenues in
astronomy and cosmology. An "on-chip" spectrometer is one such technology that
could enable Line Intensity Mapping. Recent work has shown the promise of
high-speed imaging; however, a limiting factor is that many of these devices
suffer from low optical efficiency. Here we present the fabrication of a
metalized, Si waveguide filter-bank fabricated using deep reactive ion etching
for use in millimeter spectroscopy. Our design simultaneously provides
high-density pixel packing, high optical efficiency, high spectral resolution,
and is readily compatible with simple and multiplexable MKID arrays. Gold
plated test waveguide and filter show excellent match to simulations with a
measured resolving power of 263 and a loss quality factor of 1116 at room
temperature. The results show promise for extending the measurements to larger,
multi-wavelength designs.

### [6] [A continuous transition from Type-C Quasi Periodic Oscillations to the Heartbeat state in the Black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01883)

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) 4U
1630-47 using AstroSat observations from 10-19 March 2023, for the first time
capturing a rare and rapid transition in variability properties. Within less
than a day, the source evolved from a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)
state, with centroid frequencies between 3-5 Hz, to the Heartbeat state,
characterized by a broad peak in the power density spectrum at ~25 mHz,
corresponding to a ~40 s modulation period. As the source evolved, it passed
through a transition track where the QPO features weakened and ultimately
disappeared in the Heartbeat state. In the hardness-intensity Diagram, the QPOs
occur at higher hardness and lower intensity, followed by a brightening phase
as the source moved towards the soft intermediate state, and finally reached
the Heartbeat state through a transition towards lower hardness. In the
power-color diagram, this transition is marked by a clear shift to a distinct
region of power color space, separate from the range occupied by other observed
states. This work establishes 4U 1630-47 as another system, apart from GRS
1915+105, where a continuous transition from QPO to Heartbeat state has been
observed. Notably, 4U 1630-47 is the only system where the QPO is absent during
the heartbeat state. This provides us with another probe to understand the
physical mechanism governing this transition and the overall accretion
mechanism in BHXRBs.

### [7] [Optimal strategies for continuous wave detection in pulsar timing arrays: Realistic pulsar noise and a gravitational wave background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01919)
*Shashwat C. Sardesai,Gabriel E. Freedman,Sarah J. Vigeland,Caitlin A. Witt*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of pulsar red noise and gravitational wave background (GWB) on the Fp-statistic, a method for detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs). It finds that both marginalizing over red noise and using maximum-likelihood values yield similar results. Analysis of the NANOGrav 12.5-year data using Fp-statistic shows no evidence for CWs, aligning with earlier Bayesian findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess how pulsar red noise and GWB affect the Fp-statistic's performance in detecting CWs. This is important because these noise sources could obscure or mimic CW signals, potentially leading to false conclusions in GW searches.

Method: The study compares two approaches to handling red noise: marginalization and using maximum-likelihood estimates. They apply the Fp-statistic to the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset, evaluating its sensitivity to CWs while considering GWB contributions.

Result: The results show minimal difference between the two red noise treatment methods. The Fp-statistic analysis of the dataset does not detect any CW signals, consistent with previous Bayesian analyses.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Fp-statistic is robust against the tested noise sources and can reliably search for CWs without needing complex noise marginalization. The lack of CW detection in NANOGrav data reinforces the current understanding of the GW sky in this frequency range.

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves
(GWs), such as those produced by supermassive binary black holes at subparsec
separations. The incoherent superposition of GWs emitted by a cosmological
population of these sources produces a gravitational wave background (GWB),
while some individual sources may be resolvable as deterministic signals with
slowly varying GW frequencies, which are often referred to as "continuous
waves" (CWs). The Fp-statistic is a frequentist method of detecting these CWs.
In this paper, we study how the presence of pulsar red noise and a GWB affect
the Fp-statistic. We compare results when marginalizing over the red noise and
using the maximum-likelihood values of the red noise, and find little
difference between the two. We also present results of using the Fp-statistic
to analyze the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, where we find no evidence for CWs
in agreement with the previously published Bayesian results.

Abstract: The study of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is
a key ingredient to study binary and stellar evolution under extreme
conditions. In this context, an accurate analysis of the optical emission,
which is mostly dominated by the companion star, is essential for a
comprehensive characterization of these systems and their role within their
environment. In this work, we present a multi-wavelength investigation of five
binary MSPs in the Galactic GC M3 (NGC 5272) using archival Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) data. Our analysis builds on the timing solutions obtained with
the FAST radio Telescope by Li et al. (2024). For each MSP, we carry out
precise astrometric cross-matching with the accurate radio positions to
identify potential counterparts. When a match is found, we analyse its location
in the colour-magnitude diagrams and compare the results with updated binary
evolution models to infer the system properties. We confirm the identification
of the optical companion to M3B, matching the source previously reported by
Cadelano et al. (2019), and successfully identify and characterize the optical
companions to M3D and M3F. All three are consistent with helium white dwarfs,
as expected from the canonical formation scenario. For M3A and M3E, no reliable
counterparts are found, but we place strong upper limits on the brightness and
mass of the undetected companion. In the case of M3E, we detect a red object
near the radio position in two F814W observations; however, astrometric
measurements over a 15-year baseline reveal a significant proper motion
inconsistent with cluster membership, identifying the source as a foreground
contaminant. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining precise radio
timing with deep, multi-band HST images to uncover and constrain the nature of
MSP companions in GCs, offering insights into their formation and evolutionary
histories.

### [9] [The complicated nature of the X-ray emission from the field of the strongly lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxy PJ1053+60 at z=3.549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02037)
*Carlos Garcia Diaz,Q. Daniel Wang,Kevin C. Harrington,James D. Lowenthal,Patrick S. Kamieneski,Eric F. Jimenez-Andrade,Nicholas Foo,Min S. Yun,Brenda L. Frye,Dazhi Zhou,Amit Vishwas,Ilsang Yoon,Belen Alcalde Pampliega,Daizhong Liu,Massimo Pascale*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes XMM-Newton X-ray observations and GNIRS spectroscopy of the strongly lensed HyLIRG PJ1053+60 at z=3.549. It identifies an AGN (AGN_SW) at z=1.373 and an unexpectedly luminous HMXB component in the HyLIRG. The HMXB's luminosity exceeds local calibrations, leading the researchers to propose an additional AGN (AGN_FG) in the lensing foreground group at z=0.837, supported by a radio source. Higher-resolution observations are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the X-ray emission components and resolve the origin of the unexpectedly high HMXB luminosity in the lensed HyLIRG, challenging existing local galaxy calibrations.

Method: XMM-Newton X-ray observations, GNIRS spectroscopy, spectral decomposition with redshift prior, 2-D spatial analysis, and radio source correlation.

Result: AGN_SW confirmed; HMXB component shows luminosity ~50x higher than expected locally. Spatial decomposition supports high HMXB luminosity. AGN_FG proposed due to radio detection in foreground lens galaxy.

Conclusion: Enhanced X-ray emission requires AGN_FG presence. Current X-ray observatories' limitations are highlighted, necessitating high-resolution observations for better characterization of distant lensed HyLIRGs.

Abstract: We present an analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of PJ1053+60, a
hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) at z=3.549 that is strongly lensed by a
foreground group at z=0.837. We also present GNIRS spectroscopy confirming the
presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the southwest of PJ1053+60
($AGN_{SW}$) at $z_{SW}$ = 1.373 $\pm$ 0.006. Using this redshift prior, we
decompose the X-ray spectrum of PJ1053+60 into $AGN_{SW}$ and high-mass X-ray
binary (HMXB) components from the HyLIRG. The HMXB component has an unusually
high luminosity, $\sim$ 50 times higher than calibration derived from local
galaxies, and a characteristic photon index likely too flat to be caused by
high-mass X-ray binaries at rest frame energies above a few keV. Our 2-D
spatial decomposition also suggests a similarly high X-ray HMXB luminosity,
although the limited spatial resolution prevents meaningful morphological
constraints on the component. We conclude that the enhanced X-ray emission may
only be explained by the presence of another AGN ($AGN_{FG}$) embedded in the
foreground group lensing the PJ1053+60 system. The presence of $AGN_{FG}$ is
further supported by the detection of a point-like radio continuum source that
coincides with the brightest group galaxy (BGG) of the foreground lens. Our
study demonstrates the limited capability of current X-ray observatories while
highlighting the need for higher angular resolution observations to
definitively characterize the nature of X-ray emission in distant, strongly
lensed HyLIRGs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Force-free electrodynamics describes the electromagnetic field of the
magnetically dominated plasma found near pulsars and active black holes, but
gives no information about the underlying particles that ultimately produce the
observable emission. Working in the two-fluid approximation, we show how
particles can be "painted on" to a force-free solution as a function of
boundary conditions that encode the particle output of "gap regions" where the
force-free approximation does not hold. These boundary conditions also
determine the leading parallel electric field in the entire magnetosphere. Our
treatment holds in a general (possibly curved) spacetime and is phrased in
language intrinsic to the 1+1 dimensional "field sheet spacetimes" experienced
by particles stuck to magnetic field lines. Besides the new results, this
provides an elegant formulation of some standard equations; for example, we
show that the zero-gyroradius guiding center approximation is just the Lorentz
force law on the field sheet. We derive a general perturbative method and apply
it to pulsar and black hole magnetospheres with radial magnetic fields to
produce fully analytic models that capture key features of the full problem.
When applied to more realistic magnetic field configurations together with
simulation-informed boundary conditions for the gap regions, this approach has
the potential to provide global magnetosphere models without the need for
global particle-in-cell simulations.

Abstract: We analyzed 77 epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
archival data to investigate flux variability in Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$),
the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center. Among these, we identified
a rare but unusually clear and coherent ~52-minute sinusoidal modulation at 230
GHz, with a statistical significance exceeding 5{\sigma}. Modeling with a
Doppler-boosted hotspot scenario yields an orbital radius of ~4 Schwarzschild
radii and a disk inclination of 8$^\circ$ (or 172$^\circ$), providing the first
direct millimeter wavelength constraint on the inner accretion flow geometry.
This nearly face-on inclination is in good agreement with previous constraints
from GRAVITY and EHT observations. These findings provide robust, independent
evidence that millimeter-wave periodicity can directly probe the innermost
accretion flow geometry, offering a powerful complement to variability studies
at infrared and X-ray wavelengths.

Abstract: We report the search result for the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background
(DSNB) in neutrino energies beyond 9.3~MeV in the gadolinium-loaded
Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector with $22,500\times956.2$$~\rm m^3\cdot day$
exposure. %$22.5{\rm k}\times956.2$$~\rm m^3\cdot day$ exposure. Starting in
the summer of 2020, SK introduced 0.01\% gadolinium (Gd) by mass into its
ultra-pure water to enhance the neutron capture signal, termed the SK-VI phase.
This was followed by a 0.03\% Gd-loading in 2022, a phase referred to as
SK-VII. We then conducted a DSNB search using 552.2~days of SK-VI data and
404.0~days of SK-VII data through September 2023. This analysis includes
several new features, such as two new machine-learning neutron detection
algorithms with Gd, an improved atmospheric background reduction technique, and
two parallel statistical approaches. No significant excess over background
predictions was found in a DSNB spectrum-independent analysis, and 90\% C.L.
upper limits on the astrophysical electron anti-neutrino flux were set.
Additionally, a spectral fitting result exhibited a $\sim1.2\sigma$
disagreement with a null DSNB hypothesis, comparable to a previous result from
5823~days of all SK pure water phases.

### [13] [Magnetic-type Love number differentiating quark stars from neutron stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02236)
*Kenji Fukushima,Josuke Minamiguchi,Tomoya Uji*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the magnetic-type Love number as a robust indicator to distinguish quark stars (QSs) from neutron stars (NSs), as traditional compactness measures may overlap. It highlights the potential of gravitational wave observations from binary mergers to detect these differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of distinguishing QSs from NSs when their masses and radii overlap, as compactness alone is insufficient. The motivation is to find a reliable observable feature for identifying QSs, which could signify a major shift in our understanding of nuclear and quark matter.

Method: The authors investigate tidal properties of QSs and NSs, focusing on both magnetic-type and electric-type Love numbers. They analyze how these tidal parameters differentiate between the two stellar objects, particularly when their mass-radius relationships overlap.

Result: The magnetic-type Love number is found to be a decisive indicator between QSs and NSs, whereas the electric-type Love number is less effective when masses and radii are similar. Additionally, gravitational wave signals from binary mergers are shown to be sensitive enough to detect these distinctions.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave observations, especially from binary star mergers, can effectively distinguish QSs from NSs by leveraging the magnetic-type Love number, offering a pathway to confirm the existence of QSs and advance studies on dense matter.

Abstract: The quark star (QS) is a hypothetical and yet undiscovered stellar object,
and its existence would mark a paradigm shift in research on nuclear and quark
matter. Although compactness is a well-known signature for distinguishing
between two branches of QSs and neutron stars (NSs), some QSs can overlap with
NSs in the radius-mass plane. To manifest their evident differences, we
investigate the tidal properties of QSs and NSs. We then find that the
magnetic-type Love number is a robust indicator for differentiating between QSs
and NSs, whereas the electric-type one is insufficient when QSs and NSs have
similar masses and radii. Finally, we show that gravitational waves from binary
star mergers can be sensitive to differences between QSs and NSs to the
detectable level.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present high sensitivity, low radio frequency continuum observations of
the ELAIS-N1 field with 32 hours of observations of the uGMRT Band-2 ($120-250$
MHz) covering $5.86\,\text{deg}^2$ area, achieving a central off-source RMS
noise of $237\,\mu\mathrm{Jy}/\mathrm{beam}$ with a resolution of $11.45''$ at
the central frequency of 183 MHz. A radio source catalogue of 1027 sources
statistically matches with similar observations at different frequencies within
the sensitivity range of the uGMRT. The calibrated data is further used to
characterise the dominant foreground, the Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission
(DGSE), in angular scale and frequency regime. We derived the angular power
spectrum (APS) of DGSE in two ways: image-based estimator (i-APS) and
visibility-based Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE; hereafter as t-APS). We assess
the characteristics of DGSE with a power-law form of $C_{\ell} =
A({1000}/{\ell})^{\beta}$. Combining data from Band-2 and earlier Band-3
observations, we derived a spectral variation of $C_{\ell}$ in the form of
$C_{\ell} = A{\nu^{-2{\alpha}}}{\ell^{-{\beta}}}$. Our result indicates a
spectral break at $\nu = 230\,{\pm}\,5$ MHz, corresponding to a synchrotron age
of $t_\text{syn} = 106\,{\pm}\,1$ Myr for the cosmic-ray electrons (CRe). This
break result suggests a low-energy cutoff in the CRe population, leading to
spectral curvature at low frequencies. Using both of the techniques, i-APS and
t-APS, we find that the mean spectral index $\alpha$ and power-law index
$\beta$ are consistent within the frequency range $120-500$ MHz.

### [15] [Characterising EP241107a: Multiwavelength Observations of an Einstein Probe-detected Fast X-ray Transient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02562)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study presents multiwavelength observations of the Fast X-ray Transient EP241107a, discovered by the Einstein-Probe (EP), and identifies its radio counterpart. Analysis suggests its origin is a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) with specific jet properties, contributing to the understanding of FXTs. Comparison with other surveys highlights EP's role in advancing FXT research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FXTs are poorly understood transient phenomena in X-rays. The Einstein-Probe enables their discovery and study, necessitating detailed analysis to determine origins and properties. EP241107a provides a critical case study for linking FXTs to GRBs.

Method: Multiwavelength observations (X-ray, optical, radio) of EP241107a were conducted using EP, Swift, and MeerKAT. Afterglow modelling was applied to infer GRB jet parameters. Host galaxy properties and comparisons with other transients were analyzed.

Result: EP241107a's radio counterpart was detected, supporting a GRB origin. Modelling yielded a kinetic energy ~1e51 erg, 15-degree jet opening angle, and viewing angle ~9 degrees. EP's capabilities show promise for future FXT discoveries compared to previous surveys.

Conclusion: EP241107a's GRB origin strengthens the connection between FXTs and GRBs. EP's rapid response enhances transient studies, positioning it as a leading tool for unraveling FXTs' mysteries. Further multiwavelength follow-ups are needed to solidify these findings and classify FXT subclasses.

Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) represent a new class of highly luminous
transients in soft X-rays ($\sim$0.3-10 keV) associated with violent
astrophysical processes. They manifest as short, singular flashes of X-ray
photons with durations lasting from minutes to hours. Their origin remains
unclear, and they have been associated with various progenitor mechanisms. The
newly launched X-ray survey, Einstein-Probe (EP), is revolutionising this field
by enabling the discovery and immediate follow-up of FXTs. Here we present the
multiwavelength observations of EP-discovered FXT EP241107a and the discovery
of its radio counterpart. Comparison of the optical and radio observations of
EP241107a and its host properties with other extragalactic transients suggests
a gamma-ray burst (GRB) origin. Through our afterglow modelling, we infer the
GRB jet properties for EP241107a, yielding a jet of the isotropic-equivalent
kinetic energy $E_{\mathrm{K,iso}} \sim10^{51}$ erg, with a half opening angle
$\theta_{c}$ $\approx$15$^{\circ}$, viewed at an angle of $\theta_{\rm
obs}$~$\approx$9$^{\circ}$. We also evaluate EP241107a in the landscape of both
EP-discovered FXTs as well as the FXTs discovered from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and
Swift-XRT.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper uses a Supervised Variational Autoencoder (sVAE) to classify FRBs and analyze population structures, finding that repeaters and non-repeaters are distinguishable by dispersion measure excess, spectral index, and spectral running, and identifies four new repeater candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nature of FRBs by analyzing population-level structures through machine learning techniques, improving classification accuracy and interpretability of latent space representations.

Method: The study employs a Supervised Variational Autoencoder (sVAE) on the first CHIME catalog. The sVAE combines VAEs for latent space learning with supervised classification, followed by dimensionality reduction to identify population structures.

Result: The sVAE achieved high classification accuracy for FRB repeaters, showed separation between repeaters and non-repeaters, identified key features distinguishing them, and found four non-repeating FRBs as potential repeaters, two of which were previously suggested.

Conclusion: Machine learning, particularly sVAE, is effective for FRB classification and uncovering population differences, suggesting inherent structural differences between repeaters and non-repeaters linked to specific observable features.

Abstract: While the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains unknown,
population-level analyses can elucidate underlying structure in these signals.
In this study, we employ deep learning methods to both classify FRBs and
analyze structural patterns in the latent space learned from the first CHIME
catalog. We adopt a Supervised Variational Autoencoder (sVAE) architecture
which combines the representational learning capabilities of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) with a supervised classification task, thereby improving
both classification performance and the interpretability of the latent space.
We construct a learned latent space in which we perform further dimensionality
reduction to find underlying structure in the data. Our results demonstrate
that the sVAE model achieves high classification accuracy for FRB repeaters and
reveals separation between repeater and non-repeater populations. Upon further
analysis of the latent space, we observe that dispersion measure excess,
spectral index, and spectral running are the dominant features distinguishing
repeaters from non-repeaters. We also identify four non-repeating FRBs as
repeater candidates, two of which have been independently flagged in previous
studies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first complete treatment of incoherent
photon-initiated production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions, focussing
on the dilepton and diphoton final states. In the former case we compare to the
ATLAS measurement of dielectron production and find that our predictions match
the data very well. In the latter case we show that this contribution is too
small to explain the observed broad in diphoton acoplanarity background to the
purely coherent light-by-light scattering signal. We in addition consider a new
`quark emission' topology, which while naively might be expected to dominate
the incoherent diphoton production channel, is in fact found to be
kinematically suppressed. Finally, we revisit QCD-initiated diphoton production
and issue of theoretical uncertainties in this case. We find that this again
cannot explain the observed size of the higher acoplanarity background. The
production mechanism leading to this background to light-by-light production,
and the reason for its observed enhancement in comparison to the dilepton case,
therefore remains unclear.

*Pradyun Hebbar,Thandikire Madula,Vinicius Mikuni,Benjamin Nachman,Nadav Outmezguine,Inbar Savoray*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes using soft constraints instead of exact enforcements to incorporate symmetries into machine learning models, improving robustness and data efficiency with minimal model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods explicitly enforcing exact symmetries require dedicated components and struggle with real-world scenarios where symmetries might not hold precisely at fine scales. The goal is to address these issues by allowing models to learn the importance of symmetries adaptively.

Method: Two approaches are used: one penalizes model outputs based on input transformations, and another uses group theory with infinitesimal transformations. Both methods apply soft constraints rather than hard enforcement.

Result: In top quark jet tagging and Lorentz equivariance tasks, models with soft constraints showed more robust performance with negligible changes to existing state-of-the-art architectures.

Conclusion: Soft constraints offer a flexible way to integrate symmetries into ML models, enhancing performance and adaptability without requiring extensive model redesign.

Abstract: Physical symmetries provide a strong inductive bias for constructing
functions to analyze data. In particular, this bias may improve robustness,
data efficiency, and interpretability of machine learning models. However,
building machine learning models that explicitly respect symmetries can be
difficult due to the dedicated components required. Moreover, real-world
experiments may not exactly respect fundamental symmetries at the level of
finite granularities and energy thresholds. In this work, we explore an
alternative approach to create symmetry-aware machine learning models. We
introduce soft constraints that allow the model to decide the importance of
added symmetries during the learning process instead of enforcing exact
symmetries. We investigate two complementary approaches, one that penalizes the
model based on specific transformations of the inputs and one inspired by group
theory and infinitesimal transformations of the inputs. Using top quark jet
tagging and Lorentz equivariance as examples, we observe that the addition of
the soft constraints leads to more robust performance while requiring
negligible changes to current state-of-the-art models.

### [19] [Dark neutron stars from a heavy dark sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01984)
*Jacob A. Litterer,João G. Rosa*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the formation and properties of dark neutron stars in a sequestered MSSM framework, explaining dark matter abundance via dark baryons without mass tuning. These stars are smaller than regular neutron stars and could be detected via gravitational microlensing and radio signals from dark photon interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the cosmic coincidence of baryonic and dark matter densities without fine-tuning, and explore the astrophysical implications of dark baryons in a sequestered MSSM model.

Method: Theoretical analysis of dark baryon properties, considering differing supersymmetry breaking scales between visible and dark sectors. Calculated conditions for dark neutron star formation, ionization fractions of dark matter, and cooling mechanisms affecting sub-halo collapse.

Result: Dark neutron stars are predicted to have smaller mass/radius than ordinary neutron stars. A small ionized dark matter fraction enables sub-halo collapse, forming dark neutron stars and black holes. Detectability via microlensing and radio signals from dark photon kinetic mixing is proposed.

Conclusion: The model provides a natural explanation for dark matter abundance and opens observational avenues to test sequestered MSSM scenarios through astrophysical signatures of dark neutron stars and black holes.

Abstract: We study the formation and properties of dark neutron stars in a scenario
where dark matter is made up of (heavy) dark baryons in a sequestered copy of
the MSSM. This scenario naturally explains the coincidence of baryonic and dark
matter abundances without the need for tuning particle masses. In particular,
the supersymmetry breaking scales in the visible and dark sectors may differ by
up to 10-11 orders of magnitude. We argue that dark neutrons should be the
lightest dark baryons, but that dark protons may be cosmologically long lived.
This allows a small fraction of dark matter to remain ionized until the first
halos start to form, providing cooling mechanisms that foster the gravitational
collapse and fragmentation of sub-halo structures, ultimately resulting in dark
neutron star and black hole formation. For a wide range of model parameters, we
find dark neutron stars with generally smaller mass and radius than ordinary
visible sector neutron stars. We also discuss their potential detectability,
particularly through gravitational microlensing and dark magnetic dipole
radiation at radio frequencies through photon-dark photon kinetic mixing.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study explores the use of single-spin components of the spin-density matrix in the $e^+ e^- 	o tar{t}$ process at the FCC-ee collider to probe heavy new physics within the SMEFT framework. It finds that single-spin observables offer stronger constraints on SMEFT Wilson coefficients compared to spin-correlated measurements and help resolve parameter degeneracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether single-spin observables in top quark pair production at FCC-ee can provide more sensitive probes of BSM physics compared to traditional methods, and to address parameter degeneracies in SMEFT analyses.

Method: Full analysis of all spin observables and angular decomposition of $e^+ e^- 	o tar{t}$ process. Evaluated sensitivity of single-spin vs. spin-correlated observables to SMEFT Wilson coefficients using parameter scans and likelihood analysis.

Result: Single-spin measurements yield stronger constraints on SMEFT Wilson coefficients than spin-correlated ones. They effectively break degeneracies in Wilson coefficient parameter spaces that would otherwise hinder precise BSM parameter determination.

Conclusion: Single-spin observables are essential for maximizing the discovery potential of FCC-ee in probing heavy new physics via SMEFT. Their inclusion is critical for accurate interpretation of experimental results and avoiding ambiguities in BSM parameter inference.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of single-spin components of the spin-density
matrix in the $e^+ e^- \to t\bar{t}$ process at a future FCC-ee for probing
heavy new physics parametrized using the SMEFT framework. We consider the full
spectrum of spin observables and the complete angular decomposition of the
$t\bar{t}$ production process in our study. We find that single-spin
measurements generically provide stronger probes of SMEFT Wilson coefficients
than measurements where the $t\bar{t}$ spins are correlated, and that
single-spin observables are important for resolving flat directions that can
appear in the Wilson-coefficient parameter space.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the production and detection of light fermionic particles with millicharge or electromagnetic form factors using a 100 MeV electron beam and CCD sensors. Analytical and numerical methods are employed to calculate cross sections, demonstrating potential to explore uncharted parameter space and probe particle properties with sufficient experimental resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore new light fermions that could exist beyond the Standard Model, particularly those with millicharges or electromagnetic form factors, which have not been detected yet. Current direct detection experiments have not constrained this parameter space, necessitating novel experimental setups.

Method: The method involves using an electron beam (100 MeV range) to produce the particles underground, followed by detection via CCD-sensors. The authors calculate S-matrix elements and phase spaces analytically, then compute cross sections numerically.

Result: The proposed setup could probe previously unconstrained parameter space for millicharged fermions. With adequate beam time or higher energy, the method might detect electromagnetic properties like dipole moments of light fermions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the feasibility of this experimental approach to search for beyond-Standard-Model particles, emphasizing the importance of experimental resources like beam time and energy for successful detection of these particles' properties.

Abstract: In this work we explore the possibility of new light fermionic particles with
millicharge or electromagnetic form factor interactions and their underground
production via an electron beam in the 100 MeV range and their subsequent
detection using a CCD-sensor. We evaluate the S-matrix elements and the phase
spaces for production analytically, and then calculate the corresponding cross
sections numerically. For millicharged fermions this set-up could be able to
probe a window in parameter space, yet unconstrained by direct detection
experiments. The electric or magnetic dipole moment of a light fermion could
feasibly be probed with enough beam time or an increased beam energy.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes six differential cross-section measurements of top-quark pair production in the dilepton channel from ATLAS and CMS experiments, comparing data with QCD predictions both with and without toponium formation effects. Strong evidence for toponium formation is found, as indicated by Bayes factors exceeding unity (two over 20).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether toponium formation effects influence top-quark pair production cross-sections observed at the LHC, addressing discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data.

Method: Data from ATLAS and CMS were compared to QCD predictions with/without toponium effects. Toponium was modeled using a Green's function reweighting of fixed-order matrix elements, combined with a statistical model to compute Bayes factors.

Result: All observables showed Bayes factors >1, with two exceeding 20, indicating strong statistical preference for the toponium hypothesis over standard QCD predictions.

Conclusion: Toponium formation is conclusively detected in top-quark pair production at the LHC, requiring inclusion of these effects in future theoretical models for improved precision.

Abstract: We present an analysis of six differential cross-section measurements of
top-quark pair production in the dilepton channel from the ATLAS and CMS
experiments. The data are compared to state-of-the-art QCD predictions with and
without the inclusion of toponium formation effects. This contribution is
modelled via a re-weighting of fixed-order matrix elements using the Green's
function of the non-relativistic QCD Hamiltonian, and we employ a statistical
model to quantify the preference of the data for the toponium hypothesis. All
observables yield Bayes factors larger than unity, with two exceeding 20,
yielding strong evidence for toponium formation in top-quark pair production at
the LHC.

### [24] [Ultra-relativistic freeze-out: a bridge from WIMPs to FIMPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02117)
*Stephen E. Henrich,Yann Mambrini,Keith A. Olive*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper re-examines ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO) as a mechanism for dark matter (DM) production, showing that with non-instantaneous reheating after inflation, UFO can produce cold DM across a wide range of masses and parameters, challenging its historical dismissal as hot DM incompatible with ΛCDM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical rejection of UFO due to hot DM issues motivates re-examining UFO under non-instantaneous reheating scenarios to explore its viability for cold DM production compatible with observations.

Method: Analyzes UFO mechanics considering post-inflationary reheating periods, evaluates DM mass ranges (sub-eV to PeV), and examines interactions like Higgs-DM contact or mediator-based production to classify WIMP/FIMP transitions through UFO phases.

Result: Finds UFO can generate the correct relic density (Ωχh²=0.12) for DM masses across 13 orders of magnitude, reheating temps over 17 magnitudes, and BSM scales over 11 magnitudes. Highlights UFO's role in transitioning between WIMP and FIMP regimes for certain interactions.

Conclusion: UFO is a viable mechanism for cold DM production under realistic reheating conditions, offering a broader parameter space than previously thought and challenges exclusionary assumptions separating WIMP/FIMP scenarios without UFO intermediates.

Abstract: We re-examine the case for dark matter (DM) produced by ultra-relativistic
freeze-out (UFO). UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos
decouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d}
\approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann
suppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much
greater than $m_{\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at
freeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for
DM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying
incompatibility with $\Lambda$CDM, we show that when the approximation of
instantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and
account for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter
space. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo
UFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative,
post-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination. For some
interactions, such as a contact interaction between the Higgs and DM scalars,
there is a seamless transition between the WIMP and FIMP regimes which excludes
UFO. However, for many other interactions, such as SM fermions producing
fermionic DM via a heavy scalar or vector mediator, the WIMP to FIMP transition
occurs \textit{necessarily} via a large intermediate region corresponding to
UFO. We characterize the general features of UFO in this paper, while we supply
a more detailed analysis in a companion paper. We find that UFO during
reheating can produce the correct relic density ($\Omega_{\chi}h^2 = 0.12$) for
DM masses spanning about 13 orders of magnitude, reheating temperatures
spanning 17 orders of magnitude, and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effective
interaction scales spanning 11 orders of magnitude.

*Xiao-Dong Ma,Michael A. Schmidt,Weihang Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decays involving light scalar particles using an effective field theory framework. It sets strict bounds on BNV operators, predicts three-body decay modes, examines dinucleon to dilepton transitions, and proposes three UV-complete models to generate these operators. This work aids experimental searches for exotic nucleon decays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain BNV interactions through nucleon decays involving light scalars and explore their experimental signatures, as such decays offer stringent constraints on beyond-Standard-Model physics.

Method: Uses effective field theory to analyze BNV nucleon decays with light scalars, applies existing experimental data to set bounds on operators, predicts three-body decay channels, and studies dinucleon transitions in nuclei. Three UV-complete models are constructed to generate the operators at leading order.

Result: Stringent bounds on BNV operators established, prediction of specific three-body decay modes, identification of dinucleon transition contributions, and three models demonstrating how different operator subsets emerge in high-energy completions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a comprehensive theoretical basis for understanding and detecting exotic BNV nucleon decays, emphasizing the importance of both individual nucleon and dinucleon processes in experimental searches.

Abstract: New light particles have received considerable attention in recent years.
Baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decays involving such light particles are
able to provide stringent constraints. They exhibit distinctive experimental
signatures that merit thorough investigation. We systematically investigate BNV
nucleon decay with a light scalar in an effective field theory framework.
Within this framework, we set stringent bounds on BNV operators using available
experimental data and predict the occurrence of several BNV three-body nucleon
decays. We further study contributions to dinucleon to dilepton transitions in
a nucleus mediated by the scalar, which complements single nucleon decay.
Finally, we provide three ultraviolet-complete models that can generate
different subsets of BNV operators in leading order. Our theoretical framework
will facilitate experimental searches for those exotic nucleon decays.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a model extending the Standard Model with a secluded U(1)_D sector, including dark matter (DM), a Z' boson, and a scalar field. The Z' acts as a reheaton during reheating, with non-thermal DM production via its decays. Lattice simulations and gravitational wave signals are used to probe the model's cosmological dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore non-thermal DM production mechanisms and test reheating scenarios through gravitational wave signatures, addressing challenges like insufficient reheating temperatures in standard models.

Method: 1. Model setup: Construct a U(1)_D extended SM with DM, Z', and scalar field. 2. Analyze Z' as reheaton with gauge portal interactions. 3. Use lattice simulations for non-perturbative reheating stages. 4. Calculate GW backgrounds from preheating and inflation for observational tests.

Result: Identified viable DM parameter space via Z' decays, showed GW observability for reheating validation, and demonstrated sensitivity to non-thermal production mechanisms.

Conclusion: The model successfully links inflationary scalar dynamics with DM abundance prediction, offering a testable framework through gravitational wave astronomy observations.

Abstract: We consider the Standard Model (SM) extended by a secluded $U(1)_D$ gauge
sector encompassing a Dirac fermion ($\chi$) dark matter (DM), an abelian gauge
boson $Z^\prime$ and a SM-singlet complex-scalar field $\Phi$, whose radial
component drives cosmic inflation. When the Higgs portal coupling is small, the
$Z^\prime$ then acts as a {\it ``reheaton''}, dominating the energy budget of
the Universe before finally yielding the SM bath, with reheating temperature $<
O(10)$ TeV, through the gauge portal interaction. We explore the possibility
that DM freezes-in via non-thermal $Z^\prime$ decays before reheating ends,
giving rise to substantial viable parameter space. We account for
non-perturbative effects, relevant during the initial stages of reheating,
using lattice simulations. We additionally show how the cosmological
gravitational wave (GW) background produced by preheating and inflation allow
for a direct probe of the reheating mechanism.

*Vandan Patel,Juhi Oudichhya,Ajay Kumar Rai*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper uses Regge phenomenology to investigate mass spectra of cc̄cc̄ and ss̄cc̄ tetraquark states, predicting their ground and excited state masses, comparing with existing theories, and discussing potential tetraquark identifications for observed resonances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore multiquark dynamics and exotic hadron spectroscopy within QCD, the authors aim to constrain and predict tetraquark masses, providing benchmarks for experiments and aiding in resonance identification.

Method: The study employs Regge trajectory analysis with a quasi-linear ansatz to derive mass inequalities and fit (J, M²) trajectories for mass predictions. They extend analysis to radial excitations using (n, M²) trajectories and compare results against prior models.

Result: Predicted mass ranges for ground and excited states of cc̄cc̄ and ss̄cc̄ tetraquarks are presented. The ψ(4660) and χc0(4700) resonances are suggested as tetraquark candidates based on their mass predictions.

Conclusion: These results contribute to understanding exotic hadron structure and provide experimental benchmarks. The approach demonstrates Regge phenomenology's utility in multiquark systems, aiding future studies of QCD dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the mass spectra of all-charm
($cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$) and doubly strange- doubly charm ($ss\bar{c}\bar{c}$)
tetraquark states using the framework of Regge phenomenology. Employing a
quasi-linear Regge trajectory ansatz, we derive linear and quadratic mass
inequalities for hadrons, which provide constraints on the masses of tetraquark
states. We estimate the range of ground state masses of $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$
tetraquarks and determine the Regge slope parameters by fitting the
corresponding $(J, M^2)$ trajectories. These parameters are then utilized to
predict the mass spectra of orbital excited states of both $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$
and $ss\bar{c}\bar{c}$ systems in the $(J, M^2)$ plane. Furthermore, we extend
our analysis to radial excitations by exploring Regge trajectories in the $(n,
M^2)$ plane. The obtained mass predictions are compared with existing
theoretical results from various models. Additionally, we discuss the possible
identification of the experimentally observed $\psi(4660)$ and
$\chi_{c0}(4700)$ resonances as tetraquark candidates. The results presented in
this study offer useful benchmarks for future experimental investigations and
may assist in the spin-parity assignment of exotic hadronic states. Our
findings contribute to a deeper understanding of multiquark dynamics and the
spectroscopy of exotic hadrons within the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics.

### [28] [Searching for dark photons from dark-scalar decays at CEPC and FCC-ee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02318)
*Kingman Cheung,Fei-Tung Chung,Zeren Simon Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the sensitivity of CEPC and FCC-ee colliders at 240 GeV to detect heavy long-lived dark photons (above 2 GeV) produced via Higgs-like scalar mixing, using displaced vertex searches. They show potential to improve existing kinetic-mixing parameter limits by several orders of magnitude for dark photons lighter than half the scalar mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark photons are a leading DM candidate but difficult to detect. Current experiments have limited sensitivity for heavy (≳2 GeV) long-lived dark photons. The CEPC/FCC-ee offer unique opportunities via precision Higgs/SM physics to explore this parameter space.

Method: Computed production/decay rates for mixed scalar and dark photons. Developed two displaced vertex search strategies using inner tracker detectors. Used Monte Carlo simulations to assess signal acceptance and projections for CEPC/FCC-ee.

Result: With scalar-Higgs mixing angle ~0.01 (near current limits), the proposed searches can probe dark-photon kinetic-mixing parameters multiple orders below current bounds for masses under half the scalar mass.

Conclusion: Lepton collider experiments at 240 GeV provide powerful tools to explore beyond-Standard-Model physics, especially in dark sector scenarios involving Higgs portal interactions and displaced signatures.

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of proposed CEPC and FCC-ee with a
center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV to long-lived dark photons heavier than 2 GeV
that are pair-produced via the prompt decays of a light scalar mixed with the
Standard-Model Higgs boson. We compute the production and decay rates of both
the light scalar and the dark photon, and develop two search strategies
targeting displaced vertices within the inner tracker of the main detectors.
Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the signal acceptance and projected
sensitivity for each strategy. Our results show that, for the scalar-Higgs
mixing angle set at $10^{-2}$ just below the current upper limit, the proposed
searches at CEPC and FCC-ee can probe dark-photon kinetic-mixing parameter
several orders of magnitude below existing bounds, for dark photons lighter
than half the dark-scalar mass.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how gravitational acceleration can induce electromagnetic memory phases in superconductors, offering new methods for quantum phase control and testing gravitational effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate a novel mechanism where gravitational acceleration acts as a source for creating memory phases in superconducting states, thereby providing a new way to control quantum phases and study gravitational effects in conductors.

Method: The authors utilized the induced electric field and vector potential from gravitational acceleration within conductors to print memory phases in superconductors, theoretically predicting this electromagnetic memory effect.

Result: They confirmed that gravitational acceleration can indeed generate measurable memory phases in superconducting states, highlighting the interplay between gravity and quantum phenomena in conductive materials.

Conclusion: This work opens avenues for manipulating quantum states via gravitational influences and testing gravitational theories through electromagnetic responses in superconductors.

Abstract: The electromagnetic memory is a theoretically predicted effect of great
conceptual importance. In this Letter, we show that gravitation acceleration
can serve as a source to print memory phases in superconducting states, through
the electric field and vector potential it induces inside a conductor. This
physical picture offers a novel perspective on the control of quantum phases
and the test of gravitational effects in conductors.

### [30] [NLO heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions in the ACOT scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02407)
*E. Spezzano,T. Jezo,M. Klasen,P. Risse,I. Schienbein*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents NLO calculations of heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions F₄ and F₅ using the ACOT scheme in APFEL++. These calculations reveal significant contributions at low Bjorken-x, especially relevant for muon/tau scattering experiments and future polarized lepton beam experiments at EIC. NLO corrections up to 10% were observed with implications for gluon and strange quark distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately model heavy-quark effects in DIS processes critical for experiments like SHiP, IceCube, DUNE, and EIC, where lepton mass effects become significant. Existing models lack NLO precision for F₄/F₅, so this work fills that gap to improve cross-section predictions and QCD analyses.

Method: Performed NLO calculations within ACOT scheme with APFEL++ using CT18NLO PDFs. Derived analytical expressions for polarized structure functions (g₁,g₄-g₇). Studied interference effects between γ and Z bosons in polarized lepton beams at EIC.

Result: NLO corrections up to 10% compared to LO. Heavy-quark contributions prominent at low x (<1e-3) affecting gluon/strange quarks. γZ interference can be accessed with polarized beams, enhancing sensitivity at low Q². Unpolarized cases show no contribution from certain terms.

Conclusion: New calculations enable precise predictions for upcoming experiments and global QCD analyses. Highlights importance of NLO contributions and polarized setups for detecting heavy-quark effects. Recommends including these results in future PDF fits and lepton-ion collider designs.

Abstract: We present next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of heavy-quark
contributions to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_4$ and
$F_5$ within the Aivazis--Collins--Olness--Tung (ACOT) scheme, implemented in
the open source library \texttt{APFEL++} using \texttt{CT18NLO} parton
distribution functions. These structure functions, suppressed by lepton mass
effects in light-lepton processes, become significant in muon, tau-lepton and
neutrino scattering at facilities such as SHiP, IceCube, and DUNE. Our results
reveal NLO corrections up to 10\% relative to leading order, with pronounced
heavy-quark effects at low Bjorken-$x$, impacting gluon and strange quark
distributions. In the unpolarized case, $F_{4/5}^{\gamma Z}$ and
$F_{4/5}^{\gamma}$ do not contribute to the cross section, while the $\gamma Z$
interference becomes accessible with longitudinally polarized lepton beams at
the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), offering enhanced sensitivity at low $Q^2$ due
to reduced $Z$-boson propagator suppression. Analytical NLO expressions have
also been derived for the polarized structure functions $g_1$, $g_4$, $g_5$,
$g_6$, and $g_7$ in the ACOT framework. These developments enable precise
theoretical predictions for upcoming experimental programs and global QCD
analyses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the possibility of probing an extra Higgs boson at future
linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders. We consider the production process $e^+e^- \to H\nu
\bar\nu$, followed by the decay $H \to W^+W^-$, where $H$ is the extra
$\textit{CP}$-even Higgs boson of the general two Higgs doublet model (G2HDM).
This process is governed by the $\textit{CP}$-even Higgs mixing angle,
$\cos\gamma$, offering direct access to this parameter. We discuss constraints
on $\cos\gamma$ using existing LHC data and test the viability of the G2HDM
top-quark-driven scenario for electroweak baryogenesis. We perform a full Monte
Carlo simulation of the signal and background, and show that an extra Higgs
boson in the mass range $200 \leq m_H \leq 400$ GeV could be probed at high
energy linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders. Promising results are found for CLIC running
at 1.5 and 3 TeV collision energies.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the discovery reach and exclusion
limits for an ultraheavy diquark scalar (7 - 8.75 TeV) decaying into two
vectorlike quarks (1.5 - 2 TeV) at the HL-LHC, improving upon the statistical
results reported in our previous six-jet final state study. The statistical
analysis was performed using the output of Machine Learning algorithms trained
to discriminate signal from background. The mass regions of interest were
determined through scans of the local $p$-values, $CL_s$, and the upper limits
on the model-independent signal strength $\mu$. The results indicate a
promising sensitivity to ultraheavy diquark scalars within the explored mass
range, suggesting that the HL-LHC could either discover or set stringent
exclusion limits on such particles.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper systematically compares GoSam+Whizard and POWHEG-BOX for simulating Higgs boson pair production via VBF, evaluates their cross sections and distributions under SM and beyond scenarios, and examines the VBF approximation's reliability with anomalous couplings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and accuracy of different simulation tools for Higgs boson pair production in VBF processes, crucial for LHC analyses, especially under non-standard model conditions and with varying energies.

Method: The study compares cross sections and distributions from GoSam+Whizard and POWHEG-BOX under Standard Model and beyond scenarios at energies relevant to the LHC's high luminosity phase. It also analyzes the VBF approximation's performance in the presence of anomalous Higgs couplings.

Result: The tools show agreement in Standard Model predictions but reveal discrepancies in beyond SM scenarios. The VBF approximation's validity is validated for certain anomalous coupling cases, providing guidelines for experimental analysis usage.

Conclusion: Both tools are reliable for SM-based analyses but require caution in beyond SM contexts. The VBF approximation remains a useful but limited method for certain anomalous coupling studies, emphasizing the need for precise simulations in future LHC runs.

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of two state-of-the-art tools for the
simulation of Higgs boson pair production via vector boson fusion (VBF) as
implemented in the Monte-Carlo tools GoSam+Whizard and the POWHEG-BOX. Cross
sections and distributions are provided within the Standard Model and beyond,
within scenarios typical for experimental physics analyses, and for a range of
energies of relevance to the LHC and its upcoming high luminosity phase. We
further perform a detailed study of the so-called VBF approximation, in
particular in the presence of anomalous Higgs boson couplings.

### [34] [Masses of Light Flavor Mesons using Bethe-Salpeter Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02550)
*Iqra Liaqat,Faisal Akram*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses a method combining Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations with specific truncation models (Maris-Tandy dressed gluon propagator, bare/Ball-Chiu vertices) to accurately compute light meson masses. The approach respects chiral symmetry constraints and uses Pade approximation to locate amplitude poles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study light meson spectra using an approach that respects chiral symmetry constraints, avoids violating Ward-Takahashi identities, and provides accurate mass predictions with minimal computational burden.

Method: 1. Dyson-Schwinger equations truncated with Maris-Tandy model for gluon propagator
2. Bethe-Salpeter equations solved via inhomogeneous approach with Pade approximation
3. Two quark-gluon vertices considered: bare form and Ball-Chiu model
4. Axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity used as constraint during truncation

Result: Consistent meson mass results obtained from both vertex choices when combined with Maris-Tandy model. The method successfully converges without needing timelike region solutions.

Conclusion: The truncation scheme respecting chiral symmetry constraints and using Maris-Tandy/Ball-Chiu vertices provides reliable light meson mass predictions. Pade approximation efficiently handles pole localization in Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes.

Abstract: This work employs the approach based on the Bethe-Salpeter and
Dyson-Schwinger equations to study the light meson spectrum. The
Dyson-Schwinger equation of the quark propagator is truncated using the
Maris-Tandy model for the dressed gluon propagator, which incorporates both the
infrared enhancement and the perturbatively correct ultraviolet behavior.
Additionally, for the dressed quark-gluon vertex, we apply its bare form and
the Ball-Chiu model, which minimally satisfies the constraint imposed by the
gauge symmetry through its Ward-Green-Takahashi identity. Consistent truncation
of both Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson-Schwinger equations requires that axial-vector
Ward-Takahashi identity, arising from chiral symmetry of the Lagrangian of
quantum chromodynamics, must not be violated. We utilize this identity as an
additional constraint to truncate the Bethe-Salpeter equation and examine the
impact of two choices of quark-gluon vertex, along with the application of the
Maris-Tandy model on the light meson spectrum. To extract the masses of
flavored and unflavored light mesons, we solve the inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter
equation using the Pad$\acute{e}$ approximation, which enables us to locate the
poles of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude without requiring a numerical solution in
the timelike region of momentum space. We find that truncations of the
Bethe-Salpeter equation based on bare and Ball-Chiu vertices, coupled with the
Maris-Tandy model, yield consistent results.

### [35] [Searches for heavy neutrinos at 3 TeV CLIC in fat jet final states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02557)
*Yao-Bei Liu,Jing-Wei Lian*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the production and detection of TeV-scale heavy neutrinos at a future 3 TeV CLIC collider, analyzing two decay topologies to improve sensitivity to mixing parameters beyond current projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of CLIC to probe the type-I seesaw mechanism via heavy neutrino production, enhancing sensitivity to neutrino masses and mixing parameters beyond existing constraints from hadron colliders and global fits.

Method: Detector-level simulations and background analysis were conducted for two decay channels ($N \to \ell^∗ W^−∗$ with hadronic $W$ decay and $N \to 
u h \to 
u b\bar{b}$) to determine exclusion limits and discovery reaches in the $m_N$-$|V_{\ell N}|^2$ plane.

Result: 3 TeV CLIC can improve sensitivity to $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ by two orders of magnitude over future hadron colliders, achieving competitive results with other CLIC channels. Exclusion limits and discovery reaches were mapped, along with constraints from global fits.

Conclusion: CLIC offers superior sensitivity for probing TeV-scale heavy neutrinos compared to other colliders, providing crucial tests of the type-I seesaw mechanism and neutrino mass explanations.

Abstract: The type-I seesaw mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the smallness
of neutrino masses via the introduction of heavy Majorana neutrinos (N), which
also constitute a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model. In this work,
we explore the production and detection prospects of TeV-scale heavy neutrinos
($m_N \gtrsim 1$ TeV) at a future 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We
focus on two distinct decay topologies: (i) $N \to \ell^\pm W^\mp$ with
hadronic $W$ boson decay, leading to a final state with one charged lepton, a
hadronic fat-jet $J_W$, and missing transverse energy ($1\ell + J_W +
\slashed{E}_T$); and (ii) $N \to \nu h$ with subsequent Higgs decay $h \to
b\bar{b}$, yielding a Higgs-tagged fat-jet $J_h$ and $\slashed{E}_T$. Based on
comprehensive detector-level simulations and background analysis, we present
both $2\sigma$ exclusion limits and $5\sigma$ discovery reaches in the
$m_N$-$|V_{\ell N}|^2$ plane. We further extract 95\% confidence level upper
limits on the mixing parameter $|V_{\ell N}|^2$, and perform a detailed
comparison with existing constraints from direct searches at future colliders
and indirect global fits. Our findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV CLIC can
improve the sensitivity to $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ by about two orders of magnitude
compared to the projected reaches of future hadron colliders, while remaining
competitive with other CLIC search channels.

### [36] [Progress on Constraining the Strange Quark Contribution to the Nucleon Spin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02575)
*S. F. Pate,V. Papavassiliou,J. P. Schaub,D. P. Trujillo,M. V. Ivanov,M. B. Barbaro,C. Giusti*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a global fit of neutrino and parity-violating electron-scattering data to better constrain the strange quark contribution to the proton's axial form factor (G_A^s) at low Q^2. The inclusion of MiniBooNE data and three nuclear models provides significant improvements over previous analyses but highlights the need for more experimental data from exclusive proton final states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining the strange quark's contribution to the proton's spin (Δs) requires precise knowledge of G_A^s at Q^2=0. Previous global fits lacked NCE data below Q^2=0.45 GeV², limiting constraints on G_A^s. The MiniBooNE dataset fills this gap, enabling better constraints.

Method: Performed a global fit using NCE neutrino/anti-neutrino data from MiniBooNE (first time included), combined with existing PVES experiments (PVA4, HAPPEx, G0, SAMPLE). Applied three nuclear models (RFG, SuSA, SF) to model carbon target interactions. Compared model dependencies and quantified uncertainties.

Result: Significantly improved constraints on G_A^s at low Q^2 (<0.45 GeV²) compared to earlier studies. Results suggest non-zero but uncertain Δs values. Emphasizes that exclusive proton-final-state measurements (e.g., MicroBooNE) are critical for further refinement.

Conclusion: While MiniBooNE data and enhanced modeling improve understanding of strangeness contributions, substantial uncertainties remain. Future experiments focusing on exclusive proton channels and additional NCE data are essential to precisely determine Δs and fully understand proton spin structure.

Abstract: We report on a global fit of neutral-current elastic (NCE)
neutrino-scattering data and parity-violating electron-scattering (PVES) data
with the goal of determining the strange quark contribution to the vector and
axial form factors of the proton. Knowledge of the strangeness contribution to
the axial form factor, $G_A^s(Q^2)$, at low $Q^2$ will reveal the strange quark
contribution to the nucleon spin, as $G_A^s(Q^2=0)=\Delta s$. Previous fits
[1,2] of this form included data from a variety of PVES experiments (PVA4,
HAPPEx, G0, SAMPLE) and the NCE neutrino and anti-neutrino data from BNL E734.
These fits did not constrain $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ very well because there
was no NCE data for $Q^2<0.45$ GeV$^2$. Our new fit includes for the first time
MiniBooNE NCE data from both neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering; this
experiment used a hydrocarbon target and so a model of the neutrino interaction
with the carbon nucleus was required. Three different nuclear models have been
employed; a relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model, the SuperScaling Approximation
(SuSA) model, and a spectral function (SF) model [3]. We find a tremendous
improvement in the constraint of $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ compared to previous
work, although more data is needed from NCE measurements that focus on
exclusive single-proton final states, for example from MicroBooNE [4]. This
work has been published in Physical Review D [5]. [1] S.F. Pate, D. McKee, V.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the capability of TianQin and LISA to reconstruct the model
parameters in the Lagrangian of new physics scenarios that can generate a
strong first-order electroweak phase transition. Taking the dimension-six Higgs
operator extension of the Standard Model as a representative scenario for a
broad class of new physics models, we establish the mapping between the model
parameter $\Lambda$ and the observable spectral features of the stochastic
gravitational wave background. We begin by generating simulated data
incorporating Time Delay Interferometry channel noise, astrophysical
foregrounds, and signals from the dimensional-six model. The data are then
compressed and optimized, followed by geometric parameter inference using both
Fisher matrix analysis and Bayesian nested sampling with PolyChord, which
efficiently handles high-dimensional, multimodal posterior distributions.
Finally, machine learning techniques are employed to achieve precise
reconstruction of the model parameter $\Lambda$. For benchmark points producing
strong signals, parameter reconstruction with both TianQin and LISA yields
relative uncertainties of approximately $20$--$30\%$ in the signal amplitude
and sub-percent precision in the model parameter $\Lambda$. TianQin's
sensitivity is limited to stronger signals within its optimal frequency band,
whereas LISA can reconstruct parameters across a broader range of signal
strengths. Our results demonstrate that reconstruction precision depends on
signal strength, astrophysical foregrounds, and instrumental noise
characteristics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at
high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV with natural Yukawa couplings of $O(1)$,
making the test of neutrino seesaw a great challenge. It is intriguing to note
that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the upper range of the
cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a new framework
incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily
decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is
governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that
respects the shift symmetry. With the neutrino seesaw mechanism, we construct a
new realization of the Higgs modulated reheating, in which the fluctuations of
Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays and contribute to the primordial
curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and
demonstrate, for the first time, that such signatures provide an important
means to directly probe the high scale of natural neutrino seesaw. We further
analyze the interplay of the non-Gaussianity signatures with the low-energy
neutrino experiments, and their interplay with the Higgs self-coupling
measurements at the LHC and future colliders.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The infrared properties of QED are investigated within the framework of the
Dyson-Schwinger equations. Our study finds that, independently of the value of
the coupling constant, requiring the photon self-energy to be finite for any
momenta, combined with a smooth behavior for the photon-fermion vertex, is
equivalent to state that the photon is massless and that the photon propagator
diverges at low momenta as $1/k^2$. Furthermore, the Schwinger mechanism to
generate, in a gauge invariant way, a photon mass is investigated and the form
factors that can be at the origin of a possible photon mass are identified. For
the Schwinger mechanism the link between the finiteness of the photon
self-energy and the masslessness of the photon is lost. The infrared behavior
of the fermion gap equation and the vertex equation are found to be infrared
safe integral equations. Moreover, by studying chiral fermions within QED it is
observed that the requirement of the finiteness of the photon self-energy
translates into a fermion propagator that behaves as $\slashed{p}/p^4$.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to study cosmological signatures of the neutrino seesaw mechanism using Higgs modulated reheating, which links inflaton decay to right-handed neutrinos and predicts detectable non-Gaussian features in primordial perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and probe its cosmological implications, particularly matter-antimatter asymmetry and high-scale seesaw parameters.

Method: Framework where inflaton decays into right-handed neutrinos post-inflation, with decay rates modulated by Higgs field fluctuations, generating non-Gaussian signatures in primordial perturbations.

Result: Forthcoming large-scale structure surveys can probe much of the seesaw parameter space through these non-Gaussian features.

Conclusion: This approach offers a novel pathway to test high-scale seesaw mechanisms and connects particle physics with cosmological observations.

Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by seesaw mechanism
through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the
matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. In this Letter, we propose a new
approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the
interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift
symmetry. In our framework, after inflation the inflaton predominantly decays
into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations
of Higgs field that act as the source of curvature perturbations. This gives a
new realization of Higgs modulated reheating, and it produces primordial
non-Gaussian signatures that can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale
structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a
large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window
for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.

Abstract: We revisit the Standard Model description of the recently measured rare
decays $D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$. Because of the effectiveness of the
Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism in charm flavour-changing neutral currents,
those decays are driven by non-local insertions of four-quark operators.
Following previous work, we consider the mediation of resonances both for the
dipion and dilepton pairs. For the first time, we incorporate the effect of the
cascade-type topology $D^0\to \pi^-
a_1^+(1260)(\to\pi^+\rho^0(\to\ell^+\ell^-))$, which manifests distinctly in
the invariant-mass and angular distributions. We find that this partial
amplitude comprises one of the largest contributions to the decay rate and
obtain an unprecedented agreement of the Standard Model prediction with the
available LHCb data. Finally, we compare to the available CLEO-c, LHCb, and
BESIII amplitude analyses for the analogous four-body hadronic decays and find
that similar values of the hadronic parameters of our model successfully
describe the two classes of decays.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores traversable wormholes in Finsler-Randers geometry using squared-trace extended gravity, showing that the Barthel connection allows for non-exotic, physically viable wormholes with anisotropic pressure dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Finsler-Randers geometry and the Barthel connection can overcome limitations of Riemannian models in creating realistic wormholes that satisfy energy conditions without exotic matter.

Method: Modified Einstein-Hilbert action with terms involving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and its square, applied under barotropic equations of state with exponential and power-law shape functions in Finsler-Randers spacetime with Barthel connection.

Result: Finslerian anisotropy introduces new pressure dynamics, enabling classical energy conditions to be met in specific parameter ranges. The Barthel connection significantly expands the parameter space for viable wormholes compared to Riemannian models.

Conclusion: Finsler-Randers geometry with Barthel connection offers a promising framework for constructing realistic wormholes, suggesting geometric modifications enhance the potential for anisotropic spacetime structures in extended gravity theories.

Abstract: We investigate traversable wormholes in squared-trace extended gravity within
the framework of Finsler-Randers geometry equipped with the Barthel connection.
The Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by terms involving the trace of the
energy-momentum tensor and its square, generating effective anisotropies
through matter-curvature coupling. The resulting field equations are studied
under barotropic equations of state with exponential and power-law shape
functions. Finslerian anisotropy introduces novel pressure dynamics that enable
the classical energy conditions to be satisfied in specific parameter domains.
Our analysis shows that the Barthel connection significantly extends the
parameter space for non-exotic, physically viable wormholes compared to purely
Riemannian models. These findings suggest that Finslerian modifications provide
a powerful mechanism for realizing realistic wormhole structures, offering new
perspectives on anisotropic and geometrically enriched space-time
configurations in extended gravity.

### [44] [The curious case of parabolic encounters: gravitational waves with linear & non-linear memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01968)
*Samik Dutta,Ankur Chhabra,Aritra Banerjee,Sajal Mukherjee,Subhendra Mohanty*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines gravitational waves (GW) with both linear and non-linear memory effects in parabolic encounters, treating it as a distinct case. It shows that extrapolating methods from eccentric/hyperbolic scenarios leads to errors. Using effective field theory, they find unique features in the zero frequency limit for parabolic events, emphasizing challenges and new aspects in studying binaries with memory effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inaccuracy of applying calculations from eccentric or hyperbolic GW encounters to the parabolic case. The authors aim to accurately model memory effects in parabolic encounters, which are critical limits for both eccentric and hyperbolic systems but require specialized treatment.

Method: The method involves using an intrinsic parameterization and effective field theory formalism to calculate GW signals and energy spectra for parabolic encounters. This approach avoids extrapolation from other orbital cases, focusing instead on the unique dynamics of parabolic systems.

Result: Key results include identifying new features in the zero frequency limit (ZFL) for parabolic encounters, differing from hyperbolic cases which exhibit linear memory. The study clarifies that parabolic systems do not simply inherit memory properties from other orbits, necessitating dedicated analysis.

Conclusion: The conclusion underscores the necessity of treating parabolic encounters independently when studying GW memory effects. The work establishes a foundation for further research into binary systems with non-zero memory, highlighting unresolved challenges and unique characteristics of parabolic dynamics.

Abstract: The memory effect is known to introduce a permanent displacement in the
gravitational wave (GW) detectors after the passage of a GW signal. While the
linear memory adheres to the source properties, the non-linear memory is a
secondary effect sourced by the GW itself. In the present work, we discuss GW
signals with both these kinds of memory effects, while focusing on the
parabolic limit of an encounter. This special case is theoretically intriguing
and emerges as a limiting situation for both eccentric and hyperbolic events.
However, in this paper, we argue that a simple extrapolation of memory
calculations for eccentric or hyperbolic cases to the parabolic case may lead
to incorrect estimations. Therefore, we treat the parabola as a special case
and use an intrinsic parameterization, with which we calculate gravitational
wave signals and their energy spectrum via an effective field theory formalism.
Unlike the hyperbolic case, which is known to have linear memory, we notice
that parabolic encounters bring out new features in the zero frequency limit
(ZFL). Our work highlights some of the key challenges and salient aspects of
these encounters, and paves the way to study such binary evolution with nonzero
memory.

### [45] [Quasi-normal modes ratios as agnostic test of general relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02010)
*Nicola Franchini*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to test general relativity using ringdown signals from black hole mergers by analyzing frequency and damping time ratios of detected modes, which are shown to be largely independent of black hole spin and mass. These ratios form distinct 'mode islands' that can distinguish GR from alternative theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an agnostic and robust test of general relativity that does not rely on specific models of the postmerger signal. By focusing on ratios of mode frequencies and damping times, the test eliminates dependencies on black hole mass and spin, offering a clean comparison with GR predictions.

Method: The method involves fitting postmerger signals with a superposition of damped sinusoids. When at least two modes are detected, the ratios of their frequencies and damping times are computed and compared to general relativity predictions. The ratios form distinct 'mode islands' based on the mode's angular momentum (ℓ) and overtone number (n).

Result: The analysis shows that frequency and damping time ratios are largely insensitive to black hole spin, with the real part (frequency ratio) depending mainly on ℓ and the imaginary part (damping time ratio) on n. These ratios form predictable 'mode islands' which differ significantly in alternative theories of gravity.

Conclusion: The proposed ratio-based test provides a powerful tool for verifying general relativity using future gravitational wave detectors. By observing deviations from GR's 'mode islands,' researchers can identify alternative theories of gravity or different field contents. The method's spin insensitivity and mass independence make it highly versatile for upcoming observations.

Abstract: In this letter, we provide a novel test of general relativity based on
ringdown analysis. The test is performed on agnostic models, where the
postmerger signal is fitted with a superposition of damped sinusoids. If at
least two modes are detected, one has to compute the ratio of the frequencies
and of the damping times and compare them against the predictions of general
relativity. By considering ratios, the dependency on the black hole's mass is
scaled away. Most notably, we find that the ratios vary very little with the
spin, the real part depends mostly on the angular momentum of the mode $\ell$
and the imaginary part depends mostly on the overtone number $n$: different
combinations create specific mode islands. We provide a qualitative explanation
of these islands through a semi-analytical argument. We discuss the application
of the method to future detectors. Finally, we show that ratios in alternative
theories of gravity or between different field content drastically differ from
those of general relativity.

Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of
compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in
fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General
Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field
regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the
detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow
the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also
providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also
opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models
regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the
quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future,
the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration
will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as
the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great
interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for
investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the
special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black
hole systems.

Result: Obtained a comprehensive charged Bardeen black hole solution with cosmological constant and surrounded by quintessence and string clouds. Found that the Kretschmann scalar's behavior is significantly influenced by these parameters. Geodesic analysis revealed altered orbital dynamics compared to standard black holes.

This work offers a richer framework for studying black hole properties in complex astrophysical environments.

Abstract: Exact solutions which generalize the Bardeen black hole solution, in the
sense that several sources are taken into account, are derived. The most

Abstract: We introduce the modified Teukolsky equation within a parameterized

by two independent sets of parameters. We derive the parameterized framework of
the quasinormal mode spectra using the continued fraction method. The results
are cross-validated with the two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dark matter surrounding black holes influences their oscillations, radiation properties, and observable signatures like shadows, which has implications for astrophysical interpretations and dark matter detection.

Method: The authors use the WKB method with Padé approximants to compute quasinormal modes, simulate particle and photon trajectories, model black hole shadows, and calculate greybody factors for Hawking radiation in a Dehnen (1,4,2) dark matter halo environment.

Result: The analysis reveals measurable modifications to QNMs, shadow sizes, and radiation spectra due to dark matter, enabling constraints on halo parameters through shadow observations and providing insights into dark matter's role in black hole physics.

Conclusion: Dark matter halos significantly affect black hole dynamics and observational signatures, offering a viable pathway to probe dark matter properties using gravitational wave observations, shadow imaging, and Hawking radiation studies.

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are often surrounded by dark matter, which can

environments may affect black hole oscillations, radiation properties, and the
corresponding observational signatures.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper calculates dynamical Love numbers of Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity using a point-particle effective field theory, accounting for finite scheme-dependent contributions by matching renormalized one-point functions with classical field profiles from perturbative solutions of Regge-Wheeler/Zerilli equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conservative tidal response of black holes, extending previous work on Love numbers by including finite scheme-dependent terms beyond the known logarithmic running.

Method: Combines effective field theory (EFT) with perturbative general relativity: solves Regge-Wheeler/Zerilli equations in a small-frequency expansion for GR side, matches to EFT's renormalized one-point function using dimensional regularization and Born series for gravitational interactions.

Result: Derives expressions showing how Love number couplings depend on both logarithmic running and finite scheme-dependent terms through the regularization parameters.

Conclusion: Demonstrates compatibility between EFT framework and GR solutions for black hole tidal interactions, highlights the importance of finite terms in precise calculations of gravitational dynamics.

Abstract: Dynamical Love numbers capture the conservative response of an object to a
time-dependent external tidal gravitational field. We compute the dynamical
Love numbers of Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity within a
point-particle effective field theory framework. In addition to the known
logarithmic running, we compute the finite scheme-dependent contributions to
the Love number couplings. We do this by matching the renormalized one-point
function in the effective theory to the classical field profile computed in
general relativity. On the general relativity side, we solve the Regge-Wheeler
and Zerilli equations perturbatively in a small frequency expansion. In order
to match on the effective field theory side we include gravitational
interactions using the Born series and employ dimensional regularization to
obtain a renormalized field profile.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of the regularization parameter l and string cloud parameter a on the observational properties and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a Hayward black hole surrounded by a string cloud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how parameters l and a influence key black hole properties and QNMs, providing insights into the interaction between regular black holes and string clouds.

Method: The study uses the Hayward black hole metric with cloud of strings, solves geodesic equations, applies the Novikov-Thorne model for accretion disk imaging, and analyzes scalar/electromagnetic perturbations to compute QNMs.

Result: Increasing l reduces r+, r_ph, b_c, r_isco while increasing r_- and ω_r. Increasing a has the opposite effect on these parameters but decreases |Im(ω)| in both cases.

Conclusion: The findings establish a theoretical framework for explaining the coupling between regular black holes and string clouds, offering predictions testable by future astrophysical observations.

Abstract: In this work, we explored the Hayward black hole surrounded by a cloud of
strings, with a focus on the effects of the regularization parameter $l$ and
the string cloud parameter $a$ on its observational properties and quasinormal
modes (QNMs). Utilizing the spacetime metric and geodesic equations, we
calculated several geometric quantities characterizing the black hole. To
visualize the observational appearance of the accretion disk, we employed the
Novikov--Thorne model to simulate both its primary and secondary images.
Furthermore, we analyzed the QNMs of the black hole under scalar and
electromagnetic perturbations for different parameter values. The results
indicate that as the regularization parameter $l$ increases, the outer horizon
radius $r_{+}$, photon-sphere radius $r_{\text{ph}}$, critical impact parameter
$b_{c}$, and innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\text{isco}}$ exhibit a
gradual decrease, while the inner horizon radius $r_{-}$ and the real part of
the QNMs frequency $\omega_{r}$ increase. In contrast, as the string cloud
parameter $a$ increases, $r_{+}$, $r_{\text{ph}}$, $b_{c}$, and $r_{\text{
isco}}$ demonstrate a rapid increase, whereas $r_{-}$ and $\omega_{r}$
decrease. In both cases, the absolute value of the imaginary part of the QNMs
frequency decreases with the increase $l$ or $a$. This work offers a
theoretical foundation for understanding the coupling between regular black
holes and surrounding string clouds.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores rotating wormhole solutions in general relativity supported by complex non-phantom spinor fields and electromagnetic fields, which are asymmetric, regular, and asymptotically flat, with nonzero angular momentum. These wormholes connect two Minkowski spacetimes with differing masses and charges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how complex spinor fields and electromagnetic interactions can support rotating wormhole structures, addressing the need for exotic matter in traditional wormhole models by using non-phantom matter sources which might avoid violations of energy conditions.

Method: The authors derived exact solutions of Einstein's field equations coupled to a complex non-phantom spinor field and electromagnetic fields. They likely assumed specific symmetry conditions (e.g., stationarity, axisymmetry) and solved the resulting system numerically or analytically to characterize the spacetime properties.

Result: Three key parameters (throat parameter, spinor frequency, electromagnetic coupling constant) determine the wormhole's properties. The solutions are regular everywhere (no singularities), asymptotically flat, carry angular momentum, and connect two Minkowski regions with different masses and charges.

Conclusion: Such wormholes offer a new class of solutions in general relativity using viable matter fields, potentially providing physically meaningful models for studying relativistic objects without exotic matter. The parameters' role highlights controllable aspects for future studies or astrophysical applications.

Abstract: We consider rotating wormhole solutions in general relativity supported by a
complex non-phantom spinor field (which provides a nontrivial spacetime
topology) and electromagnetic fields. The solutions are asymmetric, regular,
asymptotically flat and carry nonzero total angular momentum. The physical
properties of the resulting configurations are completely determined by the
values of three input quantities: the throat parameter, the spinor frequency,
and the electromagnetic coupling constant. The wormholes connect two identical
Minkowski spacetimes possessing in general different masses and global charges.

### [54] [Phase Transition and Critical Behavior in Gravitational Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02450)
*Soumya Chakrabarti*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates thermodynamic aspects of spherical gravitational collapse using the Hayward-Kodama formalism, linking surface gravity to geometric variables. It identifies a critical condition (κ̇_hk = 0) as the point of second-order phase transition, independent of singularity presence. This condition aligns with null congruence expansion stability, with the apparent horizon acting as a universal critical surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the thermodynamic behavior and phase transitions during gravitational collapse, particularly understanding the role of surface gravity and geometric variables in determining critical phenomena, and to establish a connection between geometric stability and thermodynamic criticality.

Method: The authors applied the Hayward-Kodama formalism to treat the collapsing sphere as a thermodynamic system. They derived expressions for surface gravity (κ_hk) in terms of geometric variables and analyzed specific heat capacities. They identified the critical condition κ̇_hk = 0 for phase transitions, examined its independence from singularity nature, and linked it to null congruence expansion stationary points.

Result: The critical condition κ̇_hk = 0 marks a second-order phase transition in collapse dynamics, independent of the geometry being singular or non-singular. This condition corresponds to null congruence expansion stationary points, establishing the apparent horizon as a universal critical surface in the phase-space of gravitational collapse.

Conclusion: The study confirms a direct correspondence between geometric stability (via null congruence) and thermodynamic criticality (via κ̇_hk), providing a unified framework to analyze phase transitions in gravitational collapse. The apparent horizon’s role as a critical surface underscores its importance in both thermodynamic and geometric formulations of collapse dynamics.

Abstract: We present a thermodynamic analysis of spherically symmetric gravitational
collapse. Using the Hayward-Kodama formalism, we treat a collapsing sphere as a
thermodynamic system and express the surface gravity $\kappa_{hk}$ in terms of
the geometric variables. We derive the specific heat capacities and identify a
critical condition $\dot{\kappa}_{hk} = 0$ as the locus of second order phase
transition during the collapse. Through specific examples, we demonstrate that
the condition is independent of singular/non-singular nature of the geometry.
We also find that the critical condition of phase transition is equivalent to a
stationary condition of the expansion of null congruence. This establishes a
direct correspondence between geometric stability and thermodynamic
criticality, allowing the identification of apparent horizon as a universal
critical surface in the phase-space of gravitational collapse.

*Franciszek Cudek*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper establishes that any open connected region of a relativistic spacetime containing a $b$-incomplete half-curve contains a 'small' subregion with the same property, formalizing the localizability of spacetime singularities through the orthonormal frame bundle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore under what conditions spacetime singularities can be considered localizable by analyzing properties of regions surrounding $b$-incomplete curves.

Method: Uses bundle projection maps and natural distance functions on the orthonormal frame bundle $O^+M$ to construct bounded, Cauchy incomplete subregions.

Result: Proves existence of 'small' subregions around $b$-incomplete curves and shows singular regions can be covered by a shrinking sequence of such subsets, supporting localizability arguments.

Conclusion: Results suggest singular structures in classical general relativity may indeed be localizable within restricted spacetime regions via geometric properties of the frame bundle.

Abstract: We prove that every open connected region of relativistic spacetime
$(M,\textbf{g})$ that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve has an open
connected subregion that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve and is also
'small' in the following sense: it is the image, under the bundle projection
map, of some open region in the (connected) orthonormal frame bundle $O^+M$
over that spacetime which is bounded, and whose closure is Cauchy incomplete,
with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$. As a corollary, it
follows that every $b$-incomplete half-curve can be covered by a sequence of
singular regions which are images of a sequence of bounded subsets of $O^+M$
whose diameter, with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$,
tends to zero. We discuss to what extent these results can be interpreted in
favour of the claim that singular structure in classical general relativity is
'localizable'.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper addresses the apparent contradiction between theory-independent no-go theorems and recent theories that allow gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in classical gravity-quantum matter systems. It clarifies why these theories do not violate the no-go theorems and emphasizes the urgency of conducting GIE experiments to advance quantum gravity research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the confusion arising from conflicting claims about the possibility of GIE. The growing evidence of theories predicting GIE despite existing no-go theorems necessitates a clear explanation to guide future experimental efforts in quantum gravity.

Method: Analyzes the conditions and assumptions underlying existing no-go theorems. Identifies loopholes or differing premises in new theories that allow GIE without violating these theorems. Discusses how different formulations of gravity классической and quantum matter interact in these models.

Result: Demonstrates that the new theories avoid violating no-go theorems by making different assumptions (e.g., about system boundaries, measurement protocols, or environment interactions). Concludes that GIE experiments can now proceed as valid tests of quantum gravity without being invalidated by prior theoretical objections.

Conclusion: GIE experiments are crucial for distinguishing between competing theories of quantum gravity. The resolution of the no-go theorem矛盾 shows that such experiments are both feasible and necessary to make progress in understanding the quantum nature of gravity.

Abstract: Ever since gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) experiments have been proposed
as a witness of the quantum nature of gravity, more and more theories of
classical gravity coupled to quantum matter have been shown to predict GIE,
despite the existence of several theory-independent no-go theorems purportedly
claiming that it should not be possible. This note explains why this is
possible, and why this makes the GIE experiments an even more urgent matter in
quantum gravity research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: GW231123 is a short-duration, low-frequency gravitational wave signal
consistent with a binary black hole coalescence and dominated by the
merger-ringdown regime due to the high mass of the source. We demonstrate that
fits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically
preferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also
find that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with
those of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits
struggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by
labeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr
prograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with
the ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the
data better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When
fitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the
inclusion of a third mode, an ${(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone,
improves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of
general relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency
spectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency
and damping rate spectrum to within $\pm10\%$ at the 90$\%$ credible level
using a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\pm8\%$ constraints using a
model with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain.
Understanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate
analyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary
formation studies -- our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher
remnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models
including NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have
astrophysical implications.

Abstract: Recent observations suggest that the accelerated expansion of the Universe at
late times is caused by a temporally changing dark energy component, rather
than the constant one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. In this context
quintessence, i.e. a canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, plays
a prominent role. There are, however, three main types of quintessence models:
thawing quintessence, scaling freezing quintessence, and tracking quintessence.
Dynamical systems reformulations of the field equations for a broad set of
scalar field potentials, including some new ones, allow us to use dynamical
systems methods to derive global and asymptotic features, visualised in bounded
state space pictures clearly illustrating the relationships and properties of
the different types of quintessence, clarifying initial data issues, and
yielding simple and accurate approximations.

*Himanshu Chaudhary,Rattanasak Hama,Tiberiu Harko,Sorin V. Sabau,Shibesh Kumar Jas Pacif*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores cosmological tests of conformal Barthel-Kropina models using Finsler geometry. By applying conformal transformations to the Kropina metric in an osculating geometry, the models produce second-order field equations with an effective scalar field. The Friedmann equations are derived using a FLRW metric for the Riemannian component, with a parameter γ linking the one-form β and conformal factor. MCMC analysis against observational data (CC, SN Ia, BAO) shows the model successfully competes with ΛCDM as a simpler alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if Finslerian geometry-based theories (specifically conformal transformations of Kropina metrics) can provide viable, simpler alternatives to standard ΛCDM cosmology, offering new insights into dark energy dynamics through geometry rather than ad-hoc components.

Method: Implement conformal transformations on Barthel-Kropina Finsler geometry, derive Friedmann-like equations using FLRW metric for α, and impose a coupling between β components and conformal factor to close equations. Parameterize model with γ and scalar field initial conditions, then use MCMC to fit observational data.

Result: MCMC analysis confirms the model's consistency with Cosmic Chronometers, SN Ia, and BAO data. The free parameter γ is constrained, showing the model's predictions rival ΛCDM without requiring dark energy assumptions, suggesting geometric explanations may suffice.

Conclusion: Conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmology offers a valid, simpler alternative to ΛCDM by embedding dark energy effects within geometric framework of Finslerian spacetime, with promising observational consistency that merits further investigation against additional data.

Abstract: We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from
the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an
$(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our
analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric
function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$
and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the
conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of
conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models
obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the
presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The
generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the
Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a
specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the
conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is
determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free
parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological
models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic
Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of
$\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is
also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating
Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple,
alternative to standard cosmological models.

### [60] [Nested Apparent Horizons and Quantized Separation from Intense Hawking Backreaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02768)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper shows that intense Hawking radiation can create transient trapping surfaces (nested apparent horizons) outside a black hole's event horizon through quantum back reaction, using a semi-classical model. This phenomenon, similar to the Penrose process, is analyzed with a Vaidya mass profile, leading to conditions for horizon bifurcation/merger and a proposal for discrete quantization of horizon separations akin to Bohr-Sommerfeld rules, hinting at quantum gravity discreteness.

Motivation: To explore the regime where Hawking radiation's stress energy is significant enough to alter the spacetime background, leading to new horizon structures and potential quantum gravity effects.

Method: A spherically symmetric semi-classical model is employed. A smooth Vaidya-type mass profile is used to simulate the outgoing flux's effect on horizon formation. Derived conditions for horizon bifurcation and merger are analyzed, and a discrete quantization hypothesis is proposed based on Bohr-Sommerfeld-like conditions.

Result: Nested apparent horizons form due to strong outgoing null energy. Bifurcation and merger conditions are established. A discrete quantization rule for horizon separations is proposed as a geometric route to quantum gravity discreteness.

Conclusion: Quantum gravitational effects via horizon dynamics could manifest discrete structures, bridging semi-classical gravity with quantum gravity theories through geometric quantization mechanisms.

Abstract: When Hawking radiation from a rotating or non-rotating black hole becomes
sufficiently intense, its own stress energy can no longer be treated as a
perturbation on a fixed background. In this regime the outgoing flux may
generate an additional, transient trapping surf ace exterior to the original
event horizon. Using a simple spherically symmetric semi classical model we
demonstrate that strong outgoing null energy can create nested apparent
horizons, a feature reminiscent of the Penrose process but mediated by quantum
back reaction. The effect is illustrated using a smooth Vaidya type mass
profile, and conditions for bifurcation and merger of horizons are derived. We
further propose that the separation between nested horizons may obey a discrete
quantization rule analogous to the Bohr Sommerfeld condition,suggesting a
geometric route toward quantum-gravity discreteness.
