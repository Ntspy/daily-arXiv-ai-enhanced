In particular, unintended electromagnetic radiation emitted by satellite electronics exhibits strong temporal variability and weak spectral regularity, limiting the effectiveness of conventional mitigation techniques that rely on long term averaging or multi epoch observations. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of low rank interference mitigation in the single epoch regime, where only a single time frequency snapshot is available. We formulate satellite induced interference as a structured but non stationary component superposed on astrophysical signals and thermal noise, and analyze the conditions under which low rank decomposition can successfully suppress interference while preserving underlying astronomical information. Through controlled simulations and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that aggressive rank truncation can lead to substantial signal distortion, particularly for diffuse or low signal to noise astrophysical features. We quantify this trade off using preservation and suppression metrics, and show that beyond a critical interference strength, low rank methods inevitably induce irreversible information loss. Our results clarify the operational boundaries of low rank approaches for next generation radio observations and highlight the need for interference aware, data driven mitigation strategies tailored to the single epoch regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "The proliferation of LEO satellites introduces variable RFI challenging radio astronomy.

We train a base model using a photometric redshift ground truth dataset, which contains broad galaxy types but is less accurate. We then fine-tune using LoRA on a spectroscopic redshift ground truth dataset. These redshifts are more accurate but limited to bright galaxies and take orders of magnitude more time to obtain, so are less available for large surveys.

As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter.

The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order).\n  Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open.

Potential applications range from quantum machine learning methods for collider data analysis, to faster and more precise evaluations of intricate multiloop Feynman diagrams, more efficient jet clustering, improved simulations of parton showers, and many other tasks. In this work, the focus will be on two specific applications: first, the identification of the causal structure of multiloop vacuum amplitudes, a key ingredient of the Loop-Tree Duality and an area with deep connections to graph theory; and second, the integration and sampling of high-dimensional functions. The latter constitutes a first step toward the realization of a fully fledged quantum event generator operating at high perturbative orders.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find that the EL appears in the parameter space spanned by the scalar mass and the black hole spin parameter, and also in the Nariai limit, i.e., $r_{\\rm c} - r_{\\rm h} \\to 0$, where $r_{\\rm c}$ and $r_{\\rm h}$ denote the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons, respectively. We analytically study the amplitudes or excitation factors of QNMs near the EL. Such an analytic treatment becomes possible since, in the Nariai limit, the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation with the P\u00f6schl-Teller (PT) potential. We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically. Our conditions apply to a broad class of systems that involve the excitation of (nearly) double-pole QNMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent progress has shown that, by treating higher-derivative operators as perturbations, the first-order corrections to black hole thermodynamics can be obtained without explicit knowledge of the corresponding perturbed black hole solutions. This result can be understood as a consequence of an extremalization principle underlying the Euclidean action formulation of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we emphasize that this extremalization approach is not restricted to perturbations around Einstein gravity. Instead, it can be applied to perturbations of more general higher-derivative gravity theories whose black hole solutions are already known and can be taken as the zeroth-order background. As an explicit illustration, we consider Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity as the zeroth-order theory and study the first-order thermodynamic corrections induced by further higher-order curvature operators. We show that these corrections can be derived without solving the perturbed black hole solutions, both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper demonstrates that first-order thermodynamic corrections to black holes can be derived using an extremalization principle applied to higher-derivative gravity theories, even beyond Einstein gravity.", "motivation": "To extend the applicability of the extremalization principle for calculating black hole thermodynamics perturbatively beyond Einstein's gravity to more general higher-derivative theories.", "method": "The authors use the extremalization approach of Euclidean action formulation to compute first-order corrections caused by higher-derivative terms in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, avoiding explicit construction of perturbed black hole solutions.", "result": "Successful derivation of first-order thermodynamic corrections in both asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes without needing exact black hole solutions, showing the method's broad applicability.", "conclusion": "The extremalization principle is a versatile tool for perturbative calculations in higher-derivative gravity theories, offering a pathway to study black hole thermodynamics without solving complicated field equations."}}
