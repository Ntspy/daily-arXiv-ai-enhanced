Much of the DMSimps parameter space is already constrained by\ndirect and indirect detection, collider searches, and the measured DM relic\nabundance.

Using a full Boltzmann treatment that allows for\ndepartures from kinetic equilibrium near resonance, we demonstrate that this\nregime can reproduce the observed relic density with couplings compatible with\ndirect-detection limits.

Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband\nand high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize\nboth broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The\nbest-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by\nreflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona,\nmodified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the\nline of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong,\nrelativistically-broadened Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line is required in order to\nobtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence\nof a $v_{\\rm out} \\sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find\ntentative evidence for a $v_{\\rm out} \\sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and\nindicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a\nnon-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification\nschemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by\nthe best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux\nvariability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation\nof the time-averaged spectra.

This is because only the high\nfrequency Fourier modes contribute to the lensed signal. Therefore, the strong\nlensing system serves as a high-pass filter for the memory signal. Due to the\nstep function like behavior of the unlensed memory waveform, the lensed\nwaveform possesses characteristic morphology that is dependent on the type of\nthe image, and independent of the lens model and the binary system. That is,\nfor each type of the lensed image, the lensed memory waveform has an\napproxmiate reflection symmetry about a symmetrical axis in the time domain.\nMore specifically, for the type I and type III images, the lensed memory\nsignals are nearly odd under the reflection, while the type II signal is\nroughly even. In addition, at the symmetrical axis, the sign of the slope for\ntype I image is different from that for the type III image. These universal\ncharacteristic features would help determine the type of the lensed image. This\nis particularly because the memory waveform can be well approximated by a\nsuitable step function, which involves two parameters. In addition, the\ndetection of multiple images by the space-borne interferometer would also be\nhelpful. Once the type of the lensed image is determined with the approximated\nmemory waveform, one can use the appropriate waveform template for the\noscillatory component of the gravitational wave to perform the parameter\nestimation."}

Aims. We\npresent a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific\nanalysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and\nwe use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet,\noptical, and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We apply a fully-automatic\nprocedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323\nnearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results\nwith the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human\nintervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9\nof the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the\nphotometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS\nmeasurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100\n{\\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent\ncombination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the\nremaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic\nindication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions.\nIn principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport\nSystem (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an\naccuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is\nstill required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series\nof recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the\nscientific analysis of large astronomical data sets."}

Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky\nTransient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of\ntransients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims.\nWe investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous\nsupernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \\sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the\nlower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in\na faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \\simeq -14.5$ AB.\nMethods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and\nimaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the\ndata are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons\nwith other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN\n2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The\nbolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5\nx10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy\nmodeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a\nSLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling\nshows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive\nsource ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve\nevolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the\nexplosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\\rm ej} \\sim 0.24 ~M_\\odot$) took place in a\nlow mass ($M \\sim 10^{6.66}~M_\\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation\nrate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions.\nGiven its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its\nlight-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe\nTypes. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu\nand SN 2018gep."}

A widely used framework to investigate DM\nproperties is provided by simplified models (DMSimps), which extend the\nStandard Model with a DM particle and a mediator that connects the visible and\ndark sectors. Much of the DMSimps parameter space is already constrained by\ndirect and indirect detection, collider searches, and the measured DM relic\nabundance. We show, however, that the resonant regime $m_{\\rm DM}\\simeq m_{\\rm\nmed}/2$ remains viable under current bounds and will be stringently tested by\nforthcoming experiments. Using a full Boltzmann treatment that allows for\ndepartures from kinetic equilibrium near resonance, we demonstrate that this\nregime can reproduce the observed relic density with couplings compatible with\ndirect-detection limits. We also show that models with s-wave-dominated\nannihilation can explain the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess with couplings\nconsistent with relic-density and direct-detection constraints. Finally, we\npropose two minimal constructions that naturally realize $m_{\\rm med} \\approx\n2m_{\\rm DM}$, making the resonant scenario generic rather than fine-tuned."}

A Lie point symmetry is a\nstructure-preserving transformation of the spacetime variables and the fields\nof the model, which is also continuous and connected to the identity.\nSymmetries of PDEs may in general be divided into strict variational\nsymmetries, divergence symmetries and non-variational symmetries, where the\nfirst two are collectively referred to as variational symmetries. Variational\nsymmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie\nsymmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie\npoint divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the\n2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries,\nthus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method.\nMoreover, we prove three general results which may simplify Lie symmetry\ncalculations for a wide class of particle physics models. Lie symmetry analysis\nof PDEs is a broadly applicable method for determining Lie symmetries. As\ndemonstrated here by example, it can be applied to models with many variables,\nparameters and reparametrization freedom, while any missing discrete symmetries\nmay be identified through the automorphism groups of the resulting Lie symmetry\nalgebras."}

These measurements are then linearly combined\ninto a prediction of the oscillated neutrino flux at the far detector. This\nprediction is data-driven, but still dependent on some theoretical knowledge\nabout the neutrino flux. In this paper, we study to what extent off-axis\nmeasurements themselves can be used to directly constrain neutrino flux models.\nIn particular, we use them to extract separately the fluxes and spectra of\ndifferent meson species in the beam.
