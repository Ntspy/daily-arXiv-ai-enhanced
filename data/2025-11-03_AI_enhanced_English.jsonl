A unification scenario of tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been\nproposed to explain the different classes of X-ray and optically selected\nevents by introducing a dependence on the viewing angle and geometry. This work\naims to test the unification scenario among optically bright TDEs using\npolarimetry. By studying the optical linear polarisation of 19 TDEs (of which 9\nnewly analysed in this work), we place constraints on their photosphere\ngeometry, inclination, and the emission process responsible for the optical\nradiation. We study how these properties correlate with the relative X-ray\nbrightness. We find that 14/16 non-relativistic events can be accommodated by\nthe unification model. Continuum polarisation levels of optical TDEs lie most\noften in the range P ~ 1-2% (13 events), and for all except one event, remain\nbelow 6%. For those optical TDEs that have multi-epoch polarimetry, the\ncontinuum polarisation decreases after peak light for 5/10 events, increases\nfor 3/10 events, and stays nearly constant for 2/10 events. When observed after\n+70 days (7/16 events), they become consistent with P = 0% within uncertainties\n(5/7 events). This implies the photosphere geometries of TDEs are at least\ninitially asymmetric and evolve rapidly which, if tracing the formation of the\naccretion disk, suggests efficient circularisation. The polarisation signatures\nof emission lines of 7 TDEs directly support a scenario in which optical light\nis reprocessed in an electron-scattering photosphere.

The computation of Poincar\\'e maps is formulated as\neither an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP). For\nIVPs, initial conditions are embedded into the functional, and the intersection\ntime with a specified section surface is determined. We demonstrate linear\nconvergence to the Taylor series, thereby enabling accurate interpolation\nwithout resorting to numerical integration or external optimization. For BVPs,\nperiodicity conditions are encoded to identify periodic orbits in a Three-Body\nProblem context.
