TL;DR: The paper discusses the potential discovery of extraterrestrial biospheres and the transformative impact such a discovery would have on humanity's understanding of our place in the cosmos. It highlights advancements in observatory technology, such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which could enable atmospheric analysis of exoplanets and usher in a new era of astrobiological discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from humanity's curiosity about life beyond Earth and the need to understand our place in the universe. With advancements in technology, detecting biospheres on exoplanets has become a feasible goal, necessitating the development of tools like the HWO.

Method: The paper adapts a science case document for the NASA HWO mission, which focuses on using advanced telescopic instruments to analyze the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets. Techniques like spectroscopy will be leveraged to detect biosignatures indicative of life.

Result: The HWO mission aims to enable direct imaging and atmospheric characterization of exoplanets, potentially identifying habitable worlds and biosignatures. This could lead to the first confirmed detection of extraterrestrial life if such signatures are found.

Conclusion: The discovery of another biosphere would revolutionize our perspective of life's prevalence in the universe. The HWO represents a critical step toward this goal, emphasizing the importance of continued investment in next-generation astronomical tools to probe the habitability and potential life on distant planets.

Abstract: The discovery of a biosphere on another planet would transform how we view ourselves, and our planet Earth, in relation to the rest of the cosmos. We now know Earth is one planet among eight circling our sun; our sun is part of a swirling galaxy of over one hundred billion other suns; and our galaxy is one of untold billions in the universe. While we do not yet know how many, if any, other biospheres exist on the countless worlds orbiting countless other suns, we stand at the precipice of a new era of discovery, enabled by powerful new facilities able to peer across the light years into the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. This article is an adaptation of a science case document (SCDD) developed for the NASA Astrophysics Flagship mission the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Science, Technology, and Architecture Review Team (START) Living Worlds Community Working Group.

### [2] [CLiMB: A Domain-Informed Novelty Detection Clustering Framework for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09768)
*Lorenzo Monti,Tatiana Muraveva,Brian Sheridan,Davide Massari,Alessia Garofalo,Gisella Clementini,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: CLiMB is a framework that decouples prior knowledge exploitation and novel structure exploration, enhancing semi-supervised clustering by integrating constrained partitioning and density-based methods for better anomaly detection and substructure discovery, demonstrated effectively on RR Lyrae star data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semi-supervised clustering methods struggle with balancing classification of known phenomena and detecting novel anomalies, often due to rigid constraints or reliance on predefined cluster numbers. This limits their effectiveness in scientific discovery where unanticipated patterns need both validation and exploration.

Method: CLiMB uses a two-phase approach: first applying constrained clustering to anchor known classes using seeds, then applying density-based clustering on residual data to find new structures without predefined cluster counts.

Result: Achieved an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage on RR Lyrae data, significantly better than baselines (<0.20 ARI). Identified three new dynamical features, demonstrating its effectiveness in anomaly detection and scientific discovery.

Conclusion: CLiMB effectively bridges the gap between exploiting existing knowledge and discovering novel patterns, showing promise in data-driven scientific exploration where both known and unknown structures need analysis.

Abstract: In data-driven scientific discovery, a challenge lies in classifying well-characterized phenomena while identifying novel anomalies. Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.

### [3] [Monitoring of Continuous-Wave Hardware Injections in LIGO Interferometers during the O4 Observing Run](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09918)
*Preet Baxi,Jessica Leviton,Eilam Morag,Matthew Pitkin,Keith Riles*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper describes the injection and analysis of simulated continuous gravitational waves into LIGO data to validate detection methods and detector response during the O4 observing run.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure detection of weak continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars by verifying the coherence of integration over years and validating search pipelines and data cleaning.

Method: 18 simulated CW signals were injected into LIGO data via mirror modulation, spanning frequencies and sky locations. Three methods were used: templated matched filtering, F-statistic evaluation, and Bayesian reconstruction.

Result: Successful recovery of simulated signals, including phase stability over 10^11 cycles. The templated method precisely measured phase offsets, confirming timing delays in detector response.

Conclusion: Validates the end-to-end system's capability to detect weak CW signals, ensuring readiness for O4. Continuous monitoring methods are effective in maintaining detector understanding and data integrity.

Abstract: Although there have now been hundreds of transient gravitational-wave detections of merging compact stars by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, no continuous-wave (CW) signals have yet been discovered. To ensure that such signals, expected to be exceedingly weak, can be detected in the ongoing O4 observing run by coherent integration over years, simulated waveforms ('hardware injections') are injected directly into the LIGO data by continuously modulating the positions of the interferometer mirrors so as to mimic nearly sinusoidal signals from fast-spinning galactic neutron stars. A set of 18 such simulated CW sources are injected with signal frequencies spanning much of the LIGO detection band and with varying sky locations. By verifying the successful recovery of the simulated signals, including preservation of absolute phase over as many as 10^{11} signal cycles, we validate our understanding of detector response and end-to-end search pipelines, including data cleaning. Daily and weekly monitoring of the signal reconstruction is meant to catch any unexpected sudden changes in interferometer response, to verify that signal-to-noise ratio increases as expected and to verify that simulated source parameters are recovered correctly. We describe three methods of monitoring: 1) a highly templated matched filter to extract signal amplitude and phase precisely; 2) a frequentist Fstatistic evaluation that marginalizes over amplitude, phase and orientation of the star; and 3) a Bayesian reconstruction of the source parameters together with noise characterization. Results from each method are shown, with emphasis on the new templated method, which yields precise measurement of the critical phase offset parameter and therefore validates understanding of absolute timing delays in the detector response and data stream.

### [4] [What Understanding Means in AI-Laden Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10038)
*Yuan-Sen Ting,André Curtis-Trudel,Siyu Yao*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper argues that integrating AI into astronomy requires epistemological reflection using philosophy of science, addressing misconceptions about AI's role, the nature of scientific understanding, peer review challenges, and criteria for research worthiness under AI influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of AI in astronomy is often viewed as an engineering problem, but the authors emphasize the need to address the epistemological challenges this integration poses. They aim to highlight the importance of philosophical frameworks to guide this transformation, ensuring that AI's role is properly understood and managed.

Method: Analysis of interdisciplinary workshop discussions and philosophical arguments examining the assumptions underlying AI's use in astronomy, the nature of scientific understanding, and the implications for peer review and research priorities.

Result: Five key tensions are identified: misconceptions about data-driven physics derivation, the narrative aspect of understanding beyond prediction, the necessity of human peer review amidst AI-generated content, AI's limitations in problem-finding, and misplaced research priorities due to AI's capabilities. The concept of 'pragmatic understanding' is proposed as an integration framework.

Conclusion: Proactive engagement with epistemological questions is essential for astronomers to shape how AI is integrated into their practices, ensuring it complements human cognition without undermining scientific rigor or shifting priorities away from intellectually important research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming astronomical research, yet the scientific community has largely treated this transformation as an engineering challenge rather than an epistemological one. This perspective article argues that philosophy of science offers essential tools for navigating AI's integration into astronomy--conceptual clarity about what "understanding" means, critical examination of assumptions about data and discovery, and frameworks for evaluating AI's roles across different research contexts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary workshop convening astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists, we identify several tensions. First, the narrative that AI will "derive fundamental physics" from data misconstrues contemporary astronomy as equation-derivation rather than the observation-driven enterprise it is. Second, scientific understanding involves more than prediction--it requires narrative construction, contextual judgment, and communicative achievement that current AI architectures struggle to provide. Third, because narrative and judgment matter, human peer review remains essential--yet AI-generated content flooding the literature threatens our capacity to identify genuine insight. Fourth, while AI excels at well-defined problem-solving, the ill-defined problem-finding that drives breakthroughs appears to require capacities beyond pattern recognition. Fifth, as AI accelerates what is feasible, pursuitworthiness criteria risk shifting toward what AI makes easy rather than what is genuinely important. We propose "pragmatic understanding" as a framework for integration--recognizing AI as a tool that extends human cognition while requiring new norms for validation and epistemic evaluation. Engaging with these questions now may help the community shape the transformation rather than merely react to it.

### [5] [Large-scale time-series spectroscopy for stellar ages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10240)
*David Gruner,Sydney A. Barnes,Ansgar Reiners,Klaus G. Strassmeier,Cristina Chiappini,Jörg Weingrill,Michael Weber,Ilya Ilyin,Thomas Granzer,Özgün Adebali,Jean-Michel Désert,Marica Valentini,Dario Fritzewski,Paolo Ventura,Alfio Bonanno,Jose-Dias do Nascimento,Jorge Melendez,Santosh Joshi,Yong-Cheol Kim*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a program to determine stellar ages through time-series spectroscopy, aiming to shift Galactic Astronomy from a static to a dynamic field by labeling objects and events with ages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Galactic Astronomy focuses on static properties like locations and compositions, but lacks dynamic insights. Stellar ages are crucial for understanding the Galaxy's evolution, and existing methods are insufficient.

Method: The proposed method involves using time-series spectroscopy to measure stellar ages. This technique tracks changes in stellar spectra over time, allowing precise age determination for a large number of stars.

Result: Implementing this program would enable the creation of an age-labeled Galactic database, revealing temporal patterns and evolutionary processes within the Milky Way. It would complement existing surveys like Gaia by adding a temporal dimension.

Conclusion: A dedicated effort to obtain stellar ages via time-series spectroscopy is vital for transforming Galactic Astronomy into a dynamic field. This approach will provide essential temporal data to study the Galaxy's history and evolution.

Abstract: To date, Galactic Astronomy has largely concerned itself with astrophysical processes, and with the locations, space motions and compositions of objects. Consider, for example, the elucidation of the components of the Galaxy over the past decades, its mapping as enabled by Gaia and its predecessors, the photometric and spectroscopic characterization of innumerable astrophysical objects in various wavelength ranges, both from the ground and from space, and the expanding discovery and characterization of exoplanets; all focused on the current, static Galaxy. This White Paper proposes a dedicated program to derive stellar ages from time-series spectroscopy to hasten the transformation of this static conception into a dynamical one with age-labeled objects and events.

*V. Vujcic,V. A. Sreckovic,S. Babarogic*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for combining functionalities of different alert brokers in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST system and introduces a prototype tool and domain-specific language to create customized workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the community's need to integrate features from multiple brokers when handling LSST alert streams, enabling more versatile analysis and dissemination of transient astronomical events.

Method: Develops a prototype tool and a domain-specific language (DSL) allowing users to define workflows that combine functionalities from different brokers, potentially integrating data from other astronomical sources.

Result: Demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach through a prototype, showing how workflows can aggregate broker features to meet specific user requirements.

Conclusion: Advocates for further development of the tool and DSL to support dynamic, user-driven workflows in the LSST broker ecosystem, enhancing the handling and analysis of high-volume astronomical alerts.

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, through its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will soon start producing 10 million alerts on transient astronomical objects per night. Due to logistics and bandwidth, alerts will not be dispatched directly to the public but to 'brokers' i.e. tools selected by LSST to handle alert streams. Brokers offer both common, specific and micro-specific functionalities related to alert handling, analysis, representation and dissemination. In this ecosystem, potentially augmented by data streams from other astronomical sources, there is a - need demonstrated by the community - for use cases which combine features of individual brokers. In this paper we present initial efforts and a prototype of such a tool, along with a language that would allow users to define use cases / workflows in a manner tailored for the domain.

### [8] [Multibanded Reduced Order Quadrature Techniques for Gravitational Wave Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09819)
*Murdoc Newell,Alexis Boudon,Hong Qi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modified Reduced-Order Quadrature (ROQ) construction method using multiband waveforms to significantly reduce basis size and construction time, while maintaining likelihood accuracy and parameter estimation quality in gravitational wave astronomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the computational cost of ROQ basis construction for longer duration signals in gravitational wave parameter estimation, especially to speed up analyses without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: A modified PyROQ approach that employs multiband waveforms during the basis search phase. Applied to the IMRPhenomXAS_NRTidalV3 waveform in the sub-solar mass range.

Result: Achieved 20-30% reduction in basis size and ~10x decrease in construction time, with preserved likelihood accuracy and consistent parameter estimation results.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively accelerates ROQ construction without compromising performance, offering practical improvements for gravitational wave data analysis.

Abstract: Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to speed up parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, the construction of ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood speed and accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass range using the \texttt{IMRPhenomXAS\_NRTidalV3} waveform. We find a 20\% to 30\% decrease in basis size and a $\sim 10$ times decrease in basis construction time. We verify the altered method preserves the likelihood accuracy and mantains consitent parameter estimation results.

### [9] [Quantum Optical Inspired Models for Unitary Black Hole Evaporation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09820)
*Paul M. Alsing*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes optically inspired models for unitary black hole evaporation using Gaussian states and symplectic formalism to track entanglement and correlations, aiming to preserve thermal Hawking radiation and reproduce the Page Curve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black hole information paradox by creating simple, thermal-preserving models that show information release at half the BH's mass, aligning with the Page Curve.

Method: Modeling the BH as a single-mode squeezed state interacting via beam splitters and squeezers with vacuum modes, using Gaussian states and symplectic methods to track quadrature operators' evolution.

Result: Demonstrates calculation of entanglement between BH and Hawking radiation, and correlations across evaporation times, consistent with desired thermal and Page Curve behavior.

Conclusion: The approach offers a feasible framework to study unitary evaporation, maintaining quantum information principles while reproducing key informational signatures like the Page Curve.

Abstract: In this work, we describe optically inspired models for unitary black hole (BH) evaporation. The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times.

### [10] [Non-Monotonic Enhancement of the Magnetic Penrose Process in Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Spacetime and its Implication for Electron Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09919)
*Mirjavoxir Mirkhaydarov,Tursunali Xamidov,Pankaj Sheoran,Sanjar Shaymatov,Hemwati Nandan*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study explores the magnetic Penrose process in Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime, revealing non-monotonic effects of magnetic field strength on black hole horizon size and energy extraction efficiency. It also estimates electron energies up to ~10¹⁵ eV near SgrA*, considering radiative losses that reduce them to observable TeV levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how an intrinsic uniform electromagnetic field affects the magnetic Penrose process in rotating black holes, addressing gaps in understanding non-monotonic spacetime responses and potential astrophysical implications for high-energy particle acceleration.

Method: Analytical analysis of charged particle dynamics in KBR spacetime, numerical modeling of spacetime structures with varying B-field, and astrophysical application modeling neutron beta decay near black hole horizons.

Result: Discovered non-monotonic expansion/contraction of horizons and static limits with B-field, resulting in peak energy extraction efficiency at intermediate B. Calculated maximum electron energies near SgrA* and identified radiative loss mechanisms bringing them into observational consistency.

Conclusion: Magnetic fields can both enhance and suppress energy extraction from rotating black holes depending on strength, challenging previous monotonic assumptions. The process potentially contributes to TeV cosmic rays after radiative losses, requiring further observational testing.

Abstract: We studied the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (KBR) spacetime, an exact rotating electrovacuum solution describing a black hole (BH) immersed in an intrinsic, uniform electromagnetic field. We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field. Although these energies exceed the observed upper range of cosmic-ray electrons, radiative losses such as synchrotron emission and inverse-Compton scattering can efficiently reduce them to the observed $\mathrm{TeV}$ scale.

### [11] [Hubble Tension and Dark Energy in Teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet Gravity: New Constraints from DESI BAO, Pantheon$^+$ and Hubble Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10127)
*Santosh V. Lohakare,S. K. Maurya,Aaisha Al Qassabi,B. Mishra*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates a modified gravity theory (f(T, T_G) gravity) without a cosmological constant, showing it can mimic dark energy, resolve the Hubble tension, and align with observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternatives to the ΛCDM model by considering teleparallel gravity theories that address cosmic acceleration and the Hubble tension without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant.

Method: Derive modified Friedmann equations for a flat FLRW universe in f(T, T_G) gravity, solve them numerically with pressureless matter, and use Bayesian analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ SH0ES, and DESI BAO data to constrain parameters.

Result: The model produces an effective equation of state (ω_eff ≈ -0.664 to -0.693) and H0 estimates (69–71.5 km/s/Mpc), consistent with observations and reducing the Hubble tension while maintaining stability through perturbation analysis.

Conclusion: f(T, T_G) gravity emerges as a viable alternative to ΛCDM, offering a mechanism for cosmic acceleration without dark energy and addressing key cosmological inconsistencies through gravitational modifications.

Abstract: We explore the cosmological dynamics of a teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet gravity model defined by the torsion scalar $T$ and the torsion-based Gauss-Bonnet invariant $T_{\mathcal{G}}$, deriving modified Friedmann equations for a flat FLRW Universe and corresponding linear scalar perturbation equations. Using a numerical approach, we solve these equations for pressureless matter, predicting the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, incorporating late-time observations from Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ with SH0ES, and DESI BAO (Data Release 1 and Data Release 2), constrains the model parameters, revealing that $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ mimics dark energy in the absence of a cosmological constant, presenting a viable alternative to $Λ$CDM paradigm. Stability is confirmed via scalar perturbation analysis of Hubble and matter density fluctuations, positioning $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity as a robust framework to address cosmic acceleration challenges. The model yields a present-day effective equation of state $ω_{\mathrm{eff}}(z=0) \approx -0.664$ to \(-0.693\), consistent with observations, and partially alleviates the Hubble tension with $H_0$ estimates of 69 to 71.5\kms. These findings highlight the potential of $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity to resolve fundamental cosmological puzzles while aligning with late-time observational data.

### [12] [Gravitational lensing beyond the eikonal approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10239)
*Emma Bruyère,Cyril Pitrou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates wave-optics effects on scalar waves in curved spacetime, showing that gravitational lensing induces amplitude and phase corrections beyond geometric optics. In vacuum (Weyl tensor lensing), these effects emerge at G² order, while matter environments introduce corrections starting at G order. Numerical simulations around a Schwarzschild black hole and a transparent star validate the findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand beyond-geometric optics effects on waves in strong gravitational fields, exploring how scalar waves interact with spacetime curvature and matter, and determining the order of perturbations caused by gravitational potentials.

Method: Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, the authors solve the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetimes to derive corrections to wave amplitude and phase. Analytic expansions in inverse frequency are compared with numerical solutions for waves propagating near a Schwarzschild black hole and through a matter-filled transparent star.

Result: Calculations reveal that wave-optics effects (amplitude/phase shifts) first appear at G² order in vacuum spacetimes but occur at G order in the presence of matter. Numerical simulations confirm the analytic predictions, demonstrating the influence of matter density on wave propagation.

Conclusion: Scalar waves exhibit measurable wave-optics deviations from geometric optics when interacting with gravitational potentials, with matter playing a critical role in accelerating these effects. The results have implications for gravitational wave astronomy and tests of curved spacetime theories.

Abstract: Waves propagating through a gravitational potential exhibit wave-optics effects when their wavelength is not significantly smaller than the lensing scales. We study the propagation of a scalar wave, governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, to focus on effects on amplitude and phase, while leaving aside the issue of wave polarization which affects electromagnetic and gravitational waves. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we obtain the first corrections beyond the geometric optics in the expansion in the inverse frequency. In vacuum, that is for Weyl tensor lensing, there is no wave effect at first order in $G$ and wave effects start at order $G^2$. Conversely, if the wave travels through a non-vanishing matter density, the first corrections start at order $G$. We check these analytic results by solving numerically the equations dictating the evolution of the corrections either in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole or through a transparent star.

*Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,İzzet Sakallı*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the geodesic motion of photons and neutral test particles in a charged AdS black hole with a cloud of strings in Kalb-Ramond gravity, analyzing effective potentials, photon spheres, BH shadows, and QPO frequencies, using EHT data to constrain parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how additional fields (cloud of strings and KR parameters) influence black hole spacetime dynamics and observational signatures like BH shadows and QPOs, beyond standard charged BH scenarios.

Method: Analyze photon trajectories via effective potential and radial force, study BH shadow geometry dependence on CoS (α) and KR (ℓ) parameters, use EHT data from M87* and Sgr A* to constrain parameters, and investigate test particle orbits and fundamental frequencies for QPOs in modified spacetime.

Result: Parameters α and ℓ significantly alter photon sphere properties, shadow shapes, and QPO frequencies. Observational constraints from EHT data limit possible parameter values. The CoS and KR fields create distinct dynamical features different from standard charged BHs.

Conclusion: The study reveals that both the cloud of strings and KR field parameters produce measurable effects on black hole observables, offering new tests for alternative gravity theories and insights into AdS spacetime dynamics with stringy/cross-field effects.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $α$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.

### [14] [Distinguishing Quantum Matter by Gravity with Differential Scattering Cross Section at Tree Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10339)
*Xue-Nan Chen*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum weak equivalence principle based on differential scattering cross sections being independent of scattered particles' mass and properties under large target mass, showing spin-induced deviations in non-relativistic and relativistic regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the open problem of defining the quantum weak equivalence principle, specifically accounting for quantum probability effects through scattering processes.

Method: The method involves analyzing differential scattering cross sections in both non-relativistic and relativistic scenarios, considering target particles in large mass limits and examining spin effects on cross-section differences and polarization.

Result: Results show spin properties break the principle: non-relativistic differences appear at $O(p_{cm}^2)$, relativistic differences at $O(1/θ^2)$ for scalar targets and $O(1/θ^4)$ for Dirac targets. Polarization dependence is observed for Dirac particle scattering.

Conclusion: The quantum weak equivalence principle is spin-dependent, with deviations quantifiable in specific scattering orders, indicating that spin alters gravitational equivalence at quantum levels.

Abstract: The definition of weak equivalence principle of quantum matter is an open problem at present. In order to reflect the probability of quantum system in the quantum version of weak equivalence principle, we proposed a quantum weak equivalence principle based on differential scattering cross section at tree level, that is, the differential scattering cross section does not depend on the mass and properties of the scattered particles when the target particles take the large mass limit. This version of the quantum equivalence principle we proposed will be broken by the spin properties of quantum matter. In the non-relativistic case, the difference of differential scattering cross sections of scattered particles with different spin properties scattered by target particles is mainly reflected in the order of $ \mathcal O (p _ {\mathrm{cm}} ^2) $. In the relativistic case , we studied the asymptotic behavior of differential scattering cross sections at small angles. When the target particles are scalar particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \mathcal O (1/θ^2) $ order. When the target particles are Dirac particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \mathcal O (1/θ^4) $ order. The polarization of differential scattering cross section when scattered particles are Dirac particles is investigated. The result of the degree of polarization depends on the polarization direction of the incident particles.

### [15] [Analyzing intermittent stochastic gravitational wave background I:Effect of detector response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10428)
*Xiaolin Liu,Sachiko Kuroyanagi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper addresses the detection of a non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background by improving parameter estimation through a sky-dependent antenna pattern correction, resolving biases in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust detection method for the anticipated non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background from high-redshift binary black hole mergers, avoiding biases from using averaged detector responses.

Method: They propose incorporating sky-dependent antenna patterns via second-order corrections to the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model, replacing the standard sky-averaged overlap reduction function.

Result: Simulations show their method eliminates parameter estimation biases and maintains robustness for anisotropic backgrounds.

Conclusion: Accurate detection of non-Gaussian backgrounds requires spatial dependencies in detector modeling, advancing next-gen gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: With the growing number of gravitational-wave detections, particularly from binary black hole mergers, there is increasing anticipation that an astrophysical background, formed by an ensemble of faint, high-redshift events, will be observed in the near future by the ground-based detector network. This background is anticipated to exhibit non-Gaussian statistical properties. To develop a robust method for detecting such a non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background, we revisit optimal detection strategies based on the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model. In this work, we demonstrate that properly accounting for the detector antenna pattern is essential. Current approaches typically rely on the overlap reduction function averaged over the sky. Through simulations, we show that using such an averaged response introduces significant biases in parameter estimation. In addition, we propose a computationally feasible method that incorporates second-order corrections as an approximation of the full integral over the source distribution. Our results indicate that this approach effectively eliminates these biases. We also show that our method remains robust even when considering anisotropic backgrounds.

Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the physics of gravitational waves, exploring both the theoretical foundations and the most recent experimental advances. After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide.

*Faizuddin Ahmed,Ahmad Al-Badawi,Mohsen Fathi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study applies the Simpson-Visser regularization to charged AdS black holes, analyzing their geodesic structures (e.g., photon spheres, particle trajectories) and thermodynamic properties (Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy). It compares results with EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, showing how the regularization parameter affects stability and thermal behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the Simpson-Visser regularization impacts the physical observables and thermodynamics of charged AdS black holes, and to validate theoretical predictions against real observations from the EHT.

Method: The SV regularization is applied to charged AdS black holes. Geodesic analysis includes studying photon spheres, black hole shadows, and charged particle orbits. Thermodynamic quantities like temperature and specific heat are derived. Comparisons are made with EHT data.

Result: The regularization parameter significantly influences particle dynamics (e.g., orbit types), stability conditions, and thermal properties (e.g., specific heat capacity). The modified black hole solutions align with observed features of M87* and Sgr A*.

Conclusion: Regularization effects critically modulate both geometric and thermodynamic properties of charged AdS black holes, with observable consequences. This bridges theoretical modifications and astrophysical observations, offering insights into black hole physics.

Abstract: In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.

### [18] [The emergence of our Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10499)
*Jan Ambjorn,Yoshiyuki Watabiki*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model where the Universe emerges from symmetry breaking in a multicomponent W₃ algebra combined with Jordan algebras (specifically H₃(C) and H₃(O)). This process leads to an extended four-dimensional spacetime with a modified Friedmann equation, potentially explaining cosmic phenomena like accelerated expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how symmetry breaking in mathematical structures (W₃ algebra and Jordan algebras) could explain the emergence of spacetime and resolve cosmological puzzles such as dark energy or accelerated expansion.

Method: The authors use algebraic symmetry breaking of multicomponent W₃ algebra linked to Jordan algebras over complex (H₃(C)) and octonion (H₃(O)) numbers. They derive a modified Friedmann equation from this framework and analyze its cosmological implications.

Result: Symmetry breaking via Jordan algebras yields a four-dimensional spacetime with a modified Friedmann equation that may account for observed cosmic acceleration without dark energy. The model provides a theoretical basis for understanding unresolved cosmological observations.

Conclusion: The proposed algebraic symmetry breaking mechanism offers a novel pathway for deriving spacetime geometry and cosmological dynamics, suggesting that fundamental algebraic structures could underpin cosmic phenomena traditionally attributed to dark energy.

Abstract: We show how our Universe can emerge from a symmetry breaking of a multicomponent $W_3$ algebra, where the components in addition form a Jordan algebra. We discuss how symmetry breaking related to the Jordan algebras $H_3(C)$ and $H_3(O)$ over the complex and octonion numbers can lead to an extended four-dimensional spacetime, where the expansion of the Universe is governed by a modified Friedmann equation. We finally discuss how this modified Friedmann equation might explain a number of puzzling cosmological observations.

### [19] [Numerical simulations of oscillating and differentially rotating neutron stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10550)
*Santiago Jaraba,Jérôme Novak,Micaela Oertel*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper extends the ROXAS code to study oscillation frequencies of differentially rotating neutron star remnants from binary mergers, showing agreement with existing results and providing new non-axisymmetric mode data under conformal flatness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of post-merger neutron star remnants requires modeling their oscillations, which depend on differential rotation and rotation profiles. Existing models need improved accuracy by incorporating differential rotation effects.

Method: Extended ROXAS code to handle differentially rotating neutron stars using primitive variables and conformal flatness approximation. Conducted axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations with varying rotation rates to extract oscillation frequencies.

Result: Axisymmetric and Cowling approximation results match published data. The secondary fundamental mode in Cowling is an artifact not present in dynamical spacetimes. Newly obtained non-axisymmetric mode frequencies in differentially rotating systems under conformal flatness.

Conclusion: This extension enhances ROXAS's capability to model post-merger scenarios, enabling more realistic studies of gravitational waves from differentially rotating neutron stars.

Abstract: The remnants of binary neutron star mergers are expected to be massive, rapidly rotating stars whose oscillations produce gravitational waves in the kilohertz band. The degree of differential rotation and the rotation profiles strongly influence their structure, stability and oscillation spectrum, and must therefore be taken into account when modeling their dynamics. We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission.

### [20] [Rapid post-merger signal of circularly polarized gravitational wave from magnetic black hole superradiance: novel approach to detect magnetic monopole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10552)
*Zhong-Hao Luo,Fa Peng Huang,Pengming Zhang,Chen Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the effects of a spinning black hole with magnetic charge on charged scalar fields, leading to enhanced superradiant instabilities, the formation of boson clouds, and distinct gravitational wave emissions. It proposes a detection strategy using gravitational wave observatories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how magnetic charges on black holes amplify superradiant instabilities and to identify observable signatures that could confirm the existence of magnetic monopoles and ultralight bosons.

Method: Analytical modeling of a magnetically charged Kerr black hole's interaction with charged scalar fields, calculating instability growth rates and resulting gravitational wave emissions, considering polarization and observational strategies.

Result: Significant amplification of instability, creation of boson clouds emitting circularly polarized GWs at specific frequencies, and a proposed rapid post-merger GW detection strategy distinguishing magnetic remnants from Kerr.

Conclusion: Magnetic monopole and ultralight bosons can be detected via their unique GW signatures; upcoming observations could validate these predictions, offering a new method to test general relativity and particle physics beyond the Standard Model.

Abstract: We present an analytic framework demonstrating that a spinning black hole endowed with a net magnetic charge exhibits a dramatically amplified superradiant instability against charged scalar fields, enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the neutral Kerr case. The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.

### [21] [Dynamics of Late time cosmology in $f(Q,L_{m})$ Gravity with Constraints from DESI DR2 BAO Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10627)
*Rajdeep Mazumdar,Kalyan Malakar,Kalyan Bhuyan*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines late-time cosmology using a nonlinear f(Q,Lm) gravity model with parameters derived from BAO and CC data, showing it can explain cosmic acceleration with constraints tighter when using DESI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative gravity theories, specifically modified f(Q,Lm) gravity, capable of explaining the observed late-time acceleration of the universe without dark energy.

Method: Derives modified Friedmann equations for a barotropic fluid, solves analytically for H(z), and uses MCMC analysis with DESI DR2 BAO, P-BAO, and CC datasets to constrain parameters.

Result: Obtained H₀ ≈ 69.5 km/s/Mpc and q₀ ≈ -0.57, with transition redshift z_tr ~0.56-0.77. The model exhibits Chaplygin gas or quintessence-like behavior depending on the dataset. Energy stability checks validate its viability.

Conclusion: The f(Q,Lm) model provides a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology, successfully explaining cosmic acceleration with consistent parameter constraints and energy conditions.

Abstract: We investigate late-time cosmology in the context of modified $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, considering a non-linear model$ f(Q,L_m) = αQ + βL_m^n + λ$ where, $α$, $β$, $λ$, and $n$ are some free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a barotropic cosmic fluid, and an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is obtained. Using the latest DESI DR2 BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets, we constrain the model parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \simeq 69.5\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \simeq -0.57$. The transition redshift, where the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration, occurs in the range $z_{\rm tr} \sim 0.56 - 0.77$. Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $ω_{eff}(z)$. While statefinder diagnostic shows the model favours a Chaplygin gas like nature for DESI and DESI+CC, whereas the model favours as quintessence dominated evolution for P-BAO+CC in the late time regime. Conclusively, all these results along with the study of the energy conditions and stability analysis showcases the given $f(Q,L_m)$ model offers a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology

### [22] [Classical equipartition dynamics between axions and non-Abelian gauge fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09784)
*Kim V. Berghaus,Adrien Florio,M. Laine,Franz R. Sattler*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines energy transfer between an axion condensate and SU(2) gauge fields using classical lattice simulations, showing initial exponential growth of gauge modes, axion oscillation damping, and energy equipartition, highlighting differences from U(1) dynamics due to non-Abelian interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the early stages of energy transfer in axion-like inflation within the Standard Model, focusing on the non-Abelian SU(2) gauge dynamics compared to U(1) scenarios.

Method: Non-linear classical real-time lattice simulations on the CosmoLattice platform, solving discretized equations with Gauss constraints, using a quadratic potential and omitting cosmic expansion initially.

Result: Observed initial exponential growth of low-momentum SU(2) gauge modes, delayed damping of axion oscillations, and eventual energy equipartition between axion and gauge fields, with notable differences from U(1) behavior due to non-Abelian self-interactions.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that non-Abelian self-interactions play a critical role in the thermalization dynamics of SU(2) ensembles, differing from Abelian cases, which has implications for understanding early universe processes in axion-related inflation models.

Abstract: Motivated by axion-like inflation and its warm embedding within the Standard Model, we study the early stages of the energy transfer between an axion condensate and an SU(2) gauge ensemble, by employing non-linear classical real-time lattice simulations. The discretized equations of motion are worked out, elaborating on Gauss constraints. A numerical solution is implemented on the CosmoLattice platform. Adopting a quadratic potential, and omitting universe expansion for the moment, we establish initial exponential growth of the low-momentum gauge modes; damping of axion oscillations after some delay; and subsequent energy equipartition between axion and gauge ensembles. A clear difference between the SU(2) and U(1) dynamics is observed, likely associated with non-Abelian self-interactions. We elaborate on what this implies for the possible thermalization of the SU(2) ensemble.

### [23] [The Cosmic Neutrino Background is within Reach of Future Neutrino Telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09790)
*Gonzalo Herrera,Shunsaku Horiuchi,Xiaolin Qi,Ian M. Shoemaker*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper calculates the total diffuse boosted cosmic neutrino background (DBCνB) from cosmic-ray interactions with relic neutrinos using all scattering processes, including charged current and deep inelastic scatterings. It shows that IceCube constrains CνB overdensity at ~100-1000 at 10¹⁰ GeV for neutrino masses above 0.1 eV, while future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and a network could test the standard CνB density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon previous studies that only considered neutral current scatterings by including charged current and deep inelastic processes, thereby obtaining a more accurate estimate of boosted neutrino fluxes detectable by current and future neutrino telescopes.

Method: Computed DBCνB flux considering all cosmic-ray interactions (neutral/charged current elastic, and deep inelastic scatterings) across all redshifts, using CR spectra and cosmological parameters to derive constraints on CνB overdensity.

Result: IceCube sets an upper limit of ~100-1000 on CνB overdensity at 10¹⁰ GeV for m_ν ~0.1 eV. Future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 could probe overdensities down to ~1-10, and a network of 10 such telescopes could test ΛCDM-predicted CνB density matching KATRIN constraints.

Conclusion: Future neutrino observatories will significantly enhance our ability to detect the CνB and constrain cosmological models, particularly neutrino masses, by analyzing interactions with cosmic rays across cosmic history.

Abstract: The cosmic neutrino background (C$ν$B) can be boosted to high energies due to scatterings with energetic cosmic rays (CRs) across cosmological scales. Previous calculations focused on neutral current incoherent and coherent elastic scatterings of cosmic-ray protons off relic neutrinos. However, charged current interactions and deep inelastic scatterings are also expected to occur, which enhances the boosted relic neutrino fluxes on Earth. Here, we compute the \textit{total} diffuse boosted cosmic neutrino background (DBC$ν$B) arising from CRs at all redshifts in the Universe, accounting for neutral current and charged current elastic and deep inelastic scatterings. We find that IceCube already places an upper limit on the cosmic neutrino background overdensity in cosmological scales of ~$\mathcal{O}(100-1000)$ at $E_ν=10^{10}$ GeV, for a lightest neutrino mass of $m_ν \gtrsim 0.1$ eV. We further show that IceCube-Gen2 could test $\mathcal{O}(1-10)$ C$ν$B overdensities, and the combination of $10$ future neutrino telescopes with similar sensitivity would allow us to test the $Λ$CDM expected C$ν$B density for a lightest neutrino mass compatible with the KATRIN bound.

*Ivan Esteban,M. C. Gonzalez-Garcia,Michele Maltoni,Ivan Martinez-Soler,Joao Paulo Pinheiro,Thomas Schwetz*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The JUNO experiment's first data, combined with global oscillation data, shows a slight preference for Normal Neutrino Mass Ordering (NMO) over Inverted Ordering (IMO) with statistical significance between 2.2σ and 2.3σ. Including Super-K and IceCube-24 data strengthens this preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore JUNO's sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering using its first data release, complementing existing global oscillation constraints.

Method: Analyzed JUNO's first data on $Δm^2_{3greek{λ}}$ combined with global oscillation datasets, including atmospheric neutrino data from Super-K and IceCube-24, to assess mass ordering preferences.

Result: Combined analysis yields a $Δχ^2 = 4.6$ (without atmospheric data) and 9.4 (with atmospheric data) favoring NMO. IMO has a p-value of 2%-2.6%, corresponding to 2.2σ-2.3σ.

Conclusion: JUNO's initial data significantly enhance mass ordering determination when integrated with global datasets, showing a notable preference for NMO, though systematic uncertainties and fluctuations were considered.

Abstract: First results from the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment already determine with world-leading precision the small neutrino squared-mass splitting $Δm^2_{21}$ and the mixing angle $θ_{12}$. In this article we perform an exploratory study beyond these, taking advantage of the first JUNO data release to discuss its sensitivity to the large squared-mass splitting, $Δm^2_{3\ell}$. When combined with constraints from global oscillation data, this may already contain some information on the neutrino mass ordering. Indeed, we find that the combination of the complementary $Δm^2_{3\ell}$-determinations gives a slight preference for Normal Ordering, with a p-value for Inverted Ordering of 2%-2.6% ($2.2σ$-$2.3σ$). We study the robustness of this result with respect to potential systematic uncertainties and statistical fluctuations. Taken at face value, a full global analysis of oscillation data including the publicly available JUNO information and data leads to a preference for Normal Ordering with $Δχ^2 = 4.6$ and 9.4 without and with Super-K and IceCube-24 atmospheric neutrino data, respectively.

Motivation: To explore how interruptions during inflationary periods might generate detectable gravitational wave signals, enhancing our understanding of early universe physics and inflation models.

Method: Analyzing the effects of interruptions near the end of the penultimate stage in multi-stage axion monodromy inflation models to predict gravitational wave signatures.

Result: Such interruptions lead to a spike in the gravitational wave background within the sensitivity range of next-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of future detectors to verify inflationary models by observing predicted gravitational wave spikes from cosmic events like interrupted inflaton oscillations.

Abstract: We show that in multi-stage axion monodromy inflation an interruption near the end of the penultimate stage can lead to a spike in the gravitational wave background. These gravitational waves are in the frequency range and with an amplitude accessible to proposed terrestrial detectors such as the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and future Levitated Sensor Detector experiments.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper compares dispersive and non-dispersive K-matrix methods within the N/D framework, finding them equivalent in the physical region under reparameterization but divergent elsewhere. It emphasizes that model choices, especially form factors and dispersion relations, introduce interpretational ambiguities in parameters, recommending extensive data and model sampling for robust conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for accurate modeling of coupled-channel effects in high-precision hadronic (re)scattering data and resolve ambiguities in interpreting K-matrix parameters.

Method: Comparative analysis of dispersive vs. non-dispersive K-matrix formulations using synthetic data to study effects of form factors and dispersion relations within the N/D method framework.

Result: Dispersive and non-dispersive methods are equivalent in the physical region but differ outside; parameter interpretability suffers from ambiguity depending on model choices and form factors.

Conclusion: No clear preference for dispersive modeling exists, but rigorous exploration of data and model spaces is essential to ensure conclusion robustness amid parameter ambiguities.

Abstract: The modeling of coupled-channel effects has become increasingly important due to the availability of highly precise data for a large variety of hadronic (re)scattering processes. The K-matrix is a powerful, yet comparatively simple, method to describe scattering amplitudes, including coupled-channel effects, with the aim to interpret experimental data. Throughout the literature, a range of dispersive and nondispersive K-matrix methods are employed. Here, we compare the dispersive and nondispersive formulations in the context of the N/D method. It is shown that the methods are equivalent in the physical region under K-matrix reparameterization. Differences away from the physical region are examined. Applications to synthetic data are used to illustrate the effects of model choices concerning form factors and the application of dispersion relations, with the goal of clarifying best practices. We find no clear preference with regards to dispersive modeling. In contrast, we find that interpretational ambiguity of the bare model parameters -- and even of the form of the bare model -- is endemic, and recommend a thorough sampling of data and model spaces to assess conclusion robustness.

*Shuta Kosuge,Teruyuki Kitabayashi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos in the two-flavor leptogenesis scenario using the type I seesaw mechanism, determining it to be between 10⁹ GeV and 10¹² GeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the undetermined mass scale of right-handed neutrinos in the type I seesaw mechanism and provide constraints via vanilla leptogenesis calculations.

Method: Reverse-engineering general textures of the Dirac mass matrix under two-flavor leptogenesis assumptions to infer the required right-handed neutrino mass range.

Result: The lightest right-handed neutrino mass is found to be in the range of 10⁹ GeV to 10¹² GeV.

Conclusion: The derived mass scale offers a testable prediction for particle physics experiments probing leptogenesis and neutrino mass mechanisms.

Abstract: The type I seesaw mechanism is one of the leading proposed explanations for how neutrinos acquire their tiny masses. However, the mass scale of the undiscovered right-handed neutrinos required by this mechanism remains undetermined. Assuming vanilla leptogenesis in the two-flavor regime, we work backwards to find the required general textures of the Dirac mass matrix from which we determine the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino to be around $10^9 {\rm GeV}$ to $10^{12} {\rm GeV}$.

*Chong-long Xie,Guo-yun Shao,Ming-zheng-xuan Wu,Wei-bo He*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates bulk viscosity (ζ) and its ratio to shear viscosity (ζ/η) in quark matter using the PNJL model, showing peaks in ζ/s and ζ/η near QCD phase transitions, particularly influenced by strange quark chiral crossover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of bulk viscosity and its ratios across different QCD phase transitions using theoretical models, highlighting the role of medium effects and phase transitions in viscosity properties.

Method: The study employs the 2+1 flavor PNJL model with in-medium particle masses, applying kinetic theory and relaxation time approximation to calculate ζ, ζ/s, and ζ/η across Mott, chiral, and first-order transitions.

Result: ζ/s and ζ/η are minimal at high temperatures, peak near chiral transitions, and exhibit non-monotonic behavior in first-order transitions. An additional peak from strange quark chiral crossover appears beyond the main phase boundary.

Conclusion: Bulk viscosity properties reveal sensitive dependence on QCD phase transitions, with strange quark dynamics contributing significantly to viscosity peaks, implying important insights for high-energy collisions and quark-gluon plasma studies.

Abstract: Based on the kinetic theory with relaxation time approximation, we investigate the bulk viscosity ($ζ$) and its ratio to shear viscosity ($ζ/η$) of quark matter at finite temperature and chemical potential with the in-medium particle masses derived in the 2+1 flavor Polyakov-loop improved Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. We explore the behaviors of specific bulk viscosity ($ζ/s$) and $ζ/η$ across different QCD phase transitions, including the Mott phase transition, the chiral crossover, and the first-order transition with the associated metastable phase. The calculation shows that both $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ are extremely small at high temperatures, approaching the nature of a conformal theory. Larger $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ are derived near the chiral phase transition at finite temperature. Along the chiral crossover line, $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ generally increase with decreasing temperature, though $ζ/η$ exhibits a slight decline near the critical endpoint (CEP). On the boundary of the first-order transition, $ζ/s$ shows a non-monotonic variation with temperature. Furthermore, an additional peak structure emerges beyond the chiral phase boundary for both $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$, with magnitudes even exceeding those near the chiral crossover of $u, d$ quarks. Our analysis indicates this peak originates from the chiral crossover transformation of strange quark.

*Hidefumi Matsuda,Koichi Hattori,Koichi Murase*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to address computational challenges in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, demonstrating accurate angular momentum conservation and exploring spin-orbit conversion in rotating fluids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid theoretical progress in relativistic spin hydrodynamics contrasts with the lack of numerical simulations, primarily due to difficulties in conserving total angular momentum. The authors aim to develop a robust computational framework to advance this field.

Method: The study employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to simulate relativistic spin hydrodynamics. A rotating fluid in a cylindrical container is used as a test case to ensure angular momentum conservation and investigate spin-orbit conversion driven by rotational viscous effects.

Result: PINNs successfully achieved accurate conservation of angular momentum. The study found that the mismatch between transverse thermal vorticity and spin potential drives spin-orbit conversion, a key dissipative process in relativistic spin hydrodynamics.

Conclusion: PINNs provide a viable and effective numerical method for relativistic spin hydrodynamics, overcoming prior computational limitations. This approach enables deeper exploration of phenomena like spin-orbit conversion, advancing both methodology and theoretical understanding in the field.

Abstract: Theoretical developments in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, which describes the macroscopic transport of spin angular momentum alongside other fundamental conserved quantities, have progressed rapidly since the experimental observation of the global spin polarization of $Λ$ hyperons in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. However, numerical simulations of relativistic spin hydrodynamics remain largely unaddressed due to computational challenges, particularly the accurate numerical conservation of total angular momentum. In this work, we propose the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics. As a concrete application, we consider a rotating fluid confined within a cylindrical container. We show that angular-momentum conservation can be accurately achieved in the PINNs-based numerical framework. Furthermore, we investigate the spin-orbit conversion induced by the rotational viscous effect, which is the intrinsic dissipative process of relativistic spin hydrodynamics. Our analysis numerically identifies the mismatch between the transverse thermal vorticity and the spin potential as the driving mechanism of the spin-orbit conversion.

*Waqas Ahmed,Waqar Ahmad,Ahsan Illahi,M. Junaid*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines warm hybrid inflation in α-attractor models with axionic inflaton and thermal dissipation by evaluating scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio against observational data, showing viability across dissipation regimes and suggesting future CMB experiments could detect gravitational waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how thermal dissipation affects warm hybrid inflation dynamics within α-attractor models and reconcile theoretical predictions with latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) data to validate the model's observational viability.

Method: Analyzes linear (Υ ∝ T) and cubic (Υ ∝ T³) dissipation regimes in warm hybrid inflation models with axionic inflaton. Theoretical predictions for scalar spectral index (n_s) and tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) are compared against Planck+BICEP/Keck, P-ACT-LB-BK18, and SPT datasets.

Result: In weak dissipation (Q_* ≤ 1e-5), n_s ≈ 0.965 borders P-ACT-LB-BK18 constraints but tensor modes remain observable. Stronger dissipation (Q_* ≥ 1e-5) places n_s within 1-2σ confidence regions of all datasets while keeping r observable, indicating compatibility with observations.

Conclusion: Warm hybrid inflation with thermal dissipation is observationally viable across different dissipation strengths. Upcoming CMB polarization experiments could detect primordial gravitational waves, offering a critical test for the model.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of warm hybrid inflation within the framework of $α$-attractor models, where an axionic inflaton is coupled to a waterfall field in the presence of thermal dissipation. The model is analyzed for both linear ($Υ\propto T$) and cubic ($Υ\propto T^{3}$) dissipation regimes. Confronting the theoretical predictions with the latest observational data from Planck+BICEP/Keck, P-ACT-LB-BK18 and SPT, and , we find that in the weak dissipative regime ($Q_{*} \lesssim 10^{-5}$), the scalar spectral index $n_{s} \simeq 0.965$ lies at the boundary of the combined P-ACT-LB-BK18 constraints, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ remains within observable ranges. For stronger dissipation ($Q_{*} \gtrsim 10^{-5}$), the model predicts values of $n_{s}$ well within the $1$--$2σ$ confidence region of all datasets, with tensor modes remaining fully observable in both dissipation scenarios. These results indicate that forthcoming CMB polarization experiments may be capable of detecting primordial gravitational waves, thereby providing a robust observational test of warm hybrid inflation across different dissipative regimes.

### [32] [Revealing Neutrino Mass Ordering at CEPC and FCC-ee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10311)
*Wei Liu,Supriya Senapati,Jin Sun*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes using lepton-flavor structure of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) interactions at high-energy colliders to probe neutrino mass ordering, offering a complementary approach to oscillation experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open question of neutrino mass ordering (normal vs inverted hierarchy) requires alternative methods beyond low-energy oscillation experiments, necessitating high-energy collider approaches.

Method: Analyzes the Type-I seesaw model with two nearly degenerate HNLs, showing heavy-light neutrino mixings correlate with light-neutrino mass spectra, creating distinct flavor patterns for each hierarchy.

Result: Future Z factories (CEPC/FCC-ee) can detect mass ordering with total HNL mixings down to U² ≈ 4×10⁻⁹ and distinguish hierarchies above U² ≈ 1×10⁻⁶, establishing HNL colliders as a powerful probe.

Conclusion: Collider searches for HNLs provide a viable and complementary method to determine neutrino mass ordering, enhancing beyond current experimental efforts.

Abstract: The neutrino masses ordering remains one of the most important open questions in neutrino physics. While upcoming oscillation experiments aim to resolve this problem at low energies, complementary approaches are highly desirable. In this Letter, we show that the neutrino mass ordering can be probed at high-energy colliders through the lepton-flavor structure of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) interactions. In the minimal Type-I seesaw scenario with two nearly degenerate HNLs, the heavy--light neutrino mixings are strongly correlated with the light-neutrino mass spectrum, leading to distinct flavor patterns for the normal and inverted hierarchies. We demonstrate that future $Z$ factories, such as CEPC and FCC-ee, can probe the neutrino mass ordering for total HNL mixings as small as $U_{\rm tot}^2 \gtrsim 4 \times 10^{-9}$, and discriminate between the two hierarchies for $U_{\rm tot}^2 \gtrsim 10^{-6}$. Our results establish collider searches for HNLs as a powerful and complementary probe of the neutrino mass ordering.

### [33] [Flavour hierarchies from radiative corrections in latticed theory space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10316)
*Gurucharan Mohanta,Ketan M. Patel*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a mechanism using vectorlike fermions arranged in a lattice-like structure to generate hierarchical fermion masses and mixings, allowing new particles to exist at lower energy scales (≈5 TeV) compared to traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the flavour hierarchies in the Standard Model, particularly the large mass differences between fermion generations and quark mixing patterns, while satisfying experimental constraints with new physics at lower energy scales.

Method: The authors extend the Standard Model by adding vectorlike fermions and implementing a lattice structure in theory space. Locality in this lattice ensures only one generation gains a tree-level mass, with radiative corrections generating smaller masses for other generations. They analyze gauge, scalar, and Yukawa sectors' extensions and test against experimental data.

Result: The framework reproduces the observed charged-fermion masses and quark mixing. New particles (vectorlike fermions and gauge bosons) can exist at ≈5 TeV, lower than conventional models which require hundreds or thousands of TeV.

Conclusion: This mechanism offers a viable alternative to conventional radiative mass generation, potentially accessible to near-future colliders like the HL-LHC, and alleviates tensions between flavour physics constraints and low-scale new physics.

Abstract: It has recently been shown that when $N_f$ generations of chiral fermions are coupled in a specific manner to $N$ (with $N \geq 2N_f-1$) pairs of vectorlike fermions whose mass terms form a one-dimensional lattice-like structure in theory space, locality along the lattice ensures that only a single fermion generation acquires a mass at tree level. Radiative corrections can induce controlled departures from locality in the latticed space, thereby generating suppressed but non-vanishing masses for the remaining $N_f-1$ generations. In this work, we present an explicit implementation of this mechanism to address the flavour hierarchies of the Standard Model. After delineating the minimal extensions of the gauge, scalar, and Yukawa sectors required for feasible implementation of the mechanism, we demonstrate that the framework successfully reproduces the observed charged-fermion mass spectrum and quark mixing pattern. We analyse the new-physics effects arising from the extended sectors and confront them with existing constraints from direct, indirect searches and precision measurements. It is shown that a viable realisation of the mechanism allows the spectrum of vectorlike fermions and additional gauge boson to lie at scales as low as $\mathcal{O}(5)\,\mathrm{TeV}$ with the lightest states typically corresponding to top partners. This stands in sharp contrast to conventional radiative mass-generation scenarios, in which phenomenological constraints typically impose a lower bound on the new-physics scale of order a few hundred to several thousand TeV.

*Tuomas Lappi,Risto Paatelainen,Mikko Seppälä*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-loop calculation in Light Cone Perturbation Theory (LCPT) to evaluate the next-to-leading order nonsinglet splitting function, demonstrating the methodology and feasibility of higher-order calculations in LCPT. The approach uses a cutoff for longitudinal momentum integrals and dimensional regularization for transverse ones, enabling a systematic, automatizable framework for precision calculations in QCD's gluon saturation regime with clear partonic interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a robust, systematic framework for higher-order calculations in LCPT, addressing challenges in regularizing momentum integrals and enabling precision studies in the gluon saturation regime of QCD.

Method: Two-loop calculation in LCPT with a longitudinal momentum cutoff for $k^+$ poles and dimensional regularization for transverse momentum integrals, designed to cancel ambiguities and maintain physical results.

Result: Successful demonstration of LCPT's capability for higher-order computations, showing that the proposed regularization methods yield unambiguous physical results and paving the way for automated precision calculations.

Conclusion: LCPT, with the developed regularization techniques, offers a viable and transparent framework for systematic higher-order QCD calculations in the gluon saturation regime, facilitating future precision studies.

Abstract: We perform a two-loop calculation in Light Cone Perturbation Theory (LCPT) to evaluate the next-to-leading order nonsinglet splitting function. Our calculation demonstrates the methodology and feasibility of performing higher order calculations in LCPT. Since in Hamiltonian perturbation theory the longitudinal $k^+$ momentum is always positive, poles in $1/k^+$ can be regularized by a simple cutoff which cancels in physical results, without any associated ambiguities. For transverse momentum integrals we use dimensional regularization. Developing methods for loop calculations in LCPT paves the way for a systematical, automatizable procedure for precision calculations in this framework with a transparent physical partonic interpretation. This can provide a standard framework in higher order calculations in the gluon saturation regime of QCD.

*Kirill Melnikov,Ivan Novikov,Ivan Pedron*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes an alternative method using weighted sums of orthogonal basis functions to approximate kinematic distributions in high-energy physics, offering smooth results and eliminating bin-to-bin fluctuations common in traditional histogram methods. The approach is demonstrated using Higgs boson production in weak boson fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional histogram method using random event collection from Monte-Carlo integration suffers from bin-to-bin fluctuations, especially in high-order perturbative calculations. The paper aims to address these issues by proposing a more accurate and smooth approximation technique.

Method: The method replaces conventional histograms with a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions, where coefficients are computed via Monte Carlo integration. It also leverages leading-order perturbative results to construct an optimized orthonormal basis for better approximation quality.

Result: The proposed method outperforms conventional histograms in both toy-model and real Monte-Carlo tests, particularly in reducing fluctuations and providing smoother distributions. It is successfully applied to Higgs boson production in weak boson fusion.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates bin-to-bin fluctuations, improves accuracy in kinematic distribution reconstruction, and is advantageous for high-order perturbative calculations in high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: Reconstruction of one-dimensional kinematic distributions from calculations based on high-dimensional Monte-Carlo integration is a standard problem in high-energy physics. Traditionally, this is done by collecting randomly-generated events in histograms. In this article, we explore an alternative approach, whose main idea is to approximate the target distribution by a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions whose coefficients are calculated using the Monte-Carlo integration. This method has the advantage of directly yielding smooth approximations to target distributions. Furthermore, in the context of high-order perturbative calculations with local subtractions, it eliminates the so-called bin-to-bin fluctuations, which often severely affect the quality of conventional histograms. We also demonstrate that the availability of a high-quality approximation to the target distribution, for example the leading-order result in the perturbative expansion, can be exploited to construct an optimized orthonormal basis. We compare the performance of this method to conventional histograms in both toy-model and real Monte-Carlo settings, applying it to Higgs boson production in weak boson fusion as an example.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines six singly Cabibbo-suppressed D^0→VP decay channels, emphasizing the role of internal conversion (IC) processes which contribute equally to direct emission (DE) in their amplitudes through a combined analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the mechanisms behind singly Cabibbo-suppressed decays and quantify the contribution of IC processes relative to DE.

Method: Analyzing six specific D^0 decay channels (ρ±π±, K*±K∓, K*0 K̄0, and ᾱ*0K0) using a combined approach to compare DE and IC contributions.

Result: The combined analysis shows IC processes contribute to decay amplitudes at the same magnitude as DE processes, highlighting their significant role.

Conclusion: Internal conversion is a crucial component in understanding these decay mechanisms, necessitating its inclusion in theoretical models for accurate predictions.

Abstract: We investigate six singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay channels in $D^0\to VP$ ( $V$ and $P$ stand for the ground state vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively), i.e. $D^{0}\to ρ^{+}π^{-}$, $ρ^{-}π^{+}$, $K^{*+}K^{-}$, $K^{*-}K^{+}$, $K^{*0}\bar{K}^{0}$, and $\bar{K}^{*0}K^{0}$. These decay channels share the similar transition mechanisms involving only the direct emission (DE) and internal conversion (IC) processes. We show that a combined analysis of these channels can explicitly highlight the role played by the IC processes which contribute to the amplitudes at the same order of magnitude as the DE processes.

### [37] [Massless-Massive Amplitude Correspondence I: Helicity-chirality Matching and On-shell Higgsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10620)
*Yu-Han Ni,Chao Wu,Jiang-Hao Yu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes a correspondence between massive and massless scattering amplitudes using Minimal Helicity-Chirality amplitudes, allowing techniques from massless calculations to be applied to massive systems. It describes a deformation procedure and on-shell Higgsing to handle vanishing primary amplitudes and connects to the ultraviolet theory through Goldstone bosons and transverse gauge bosons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the use of well-developed massless amplitude techniques for massive systems, addressing challenges like vanishing amplitudes for vector bosons and ensuring consistency with ultraviolet completions.

Method: The method involves expanding massive spinor amplitudes in terms of the chirality-flip parameter mη, matching primary MHC amplitudes to massless ones, and using sub-leading MHC amplitudes (via on-shell Higgsing) when primary amplitudes vanish. A systematic deformation procedure is proposed for three-point interactions based on helicity-chirality unification and mη scaling.

Result: The paper derives all 3-point massless-massive amplitude correspondences in the spontaneously broken Standard Model, showing how massive amplitudes connect to ultraviolet completions through transverse gauge/Goldstone bosons and demonstrating the validity of the proposed deformation and Higgsing procedures.

Conclusion: The correspondence provides a bridge between massive and massless scattering amplitudes, enabling massless computational tools to solve massive cases. It clarifies the role of Goldstone bosons in ultraviolet theories and validates the on-shell Higgsing as a systematic transversality-flip mechanism across MHC states.

Abstract: In this work, the massless-massive correspondence for the on-shell scattering amplitudes is constructed so the massive amplitudes could inherit advantageous techniques developed in the massless calculation. This correspondence is established by matching massless amplitudes to Minimal Helicity-Chirality (MHC) amplitudes, which arise from an expansion of massive spin-spinor amplitudes in terms of the chirality-flip $mη$ order by order. The primary MHC amplitude deforms into a massless amplitude of the same helicity; if a vector boson is involved, it may instead vanish due to the associated conserved current. In cases where the primary amplitude vanishes, the leading contributions originate from descendant MHC amplitudes, each corresponding to a distinct massless amplitude in the ultraviolet theory containing either a transverse gauge boson or a Goldstone boson. We propose a systematic amplitude deformation procedure for three-point massless-massive matching based on helicity-chirality unification and the scaling properties of $mη$. Sub-leading MHC amplitudes are matched to massless amplitudes with additional on-shell Higgs splitting, a process known as on-shell Higgsing. In this work, we extend and reinterpret on-shell Higgsing as a transversality flip between different MHC states, and obtain all the 3-point massless-massive matching results in the spontaneous broken standard model.

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic framework using contact three- and four-point massive amplitudes in the minimal helicity-chirality formalism to construct higher-point electroweak amplitudes, ensuring gauge invariance. It applies bootstrap techniques and on-shell recursion relations, extending the massless-massive correspondence to general n-point amplitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in computing massive amplitudes in the Standard Model, particularly maintaining gauge invariance when extending to higher points. Existing methods for massless theories needed adaptation for massive particles, especially in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Method: Systematically constructs higher-point massive amplitudes from contact three- and four-point building blocks using the minimal helicity-chirality formalism. Applies bootstrap techniques and on-shell recursion relations. Derives gauge-invariant n-point amplitudes and extends the massless-massive correspondence through gauge deformation.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the systematic construction of electroweak amplitudes using contact amplitudes at the leading order. Confirmed the applicability of bootstrap and recursion methods for massive amplitudes, and generalized the massless-massive correspondence to n-point factorized amplitudes.

Conclusion: The developed framework offers a reliable method for calculating higher-point electroweak interactions, bridging gaps between massless on-shell techniques and massive theories. This advances precision calculations in particle physics phenomenology, particularly in Higgs physics and beyond Standard Model scenarios.

Abstract: In the minimal helicity-chirality formalism, we systematically construct higher-point massive amplitudes from the fundamental building blocks: the contact three-point and four-point massive amplitudes. The inclusion of four-point contact amplitudes is essential to maintain gauge invariance in the spontaneously broken Standard Model. We construct all the standard model massive contact amplitudes and identify the physical light-cone gauge nature of massive amplitudes. Then only using the contact minimal helicity-chirality amplitudes at the leading order, we show both bootstrap techniques and on-shell recursion relations can be utilized to compute higher-point massive amplitudes. This provides a systematic framework for constructing various higher-point electroweak amplitudes, analogous to established on-shell methods for massless theories. Finally by deforming the gauge-invariant $n$-point amplitudes, we extend the massless-massive correspondence from three-and-four point contact amplitudes to general $n$-point factorized amplitudes.

### [39] [Medium-Induced Quarkonium Dissociation at Finite Chemical Potential and Weak Magnetic Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10634)
*Indrani Nilima,Mujeeb Hasan,Mohammad Yousuf Jamal,Salman Ahamad Khan,B. K. Singh*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines how heavy quarkonium states are affected by temperature, quark chemical potential, and weak magnetic fields in a hot QCD medium. Thermal effects dominate dissociation, with binding energies decreasing and thermal widths increasing with temperature, leading to a sequential suppression pattern. While chemical potential and magnetic fields cause measurable shifts, thermal effects remain the primary driver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the in-medium behavior of heavy quarkonium, which serves as a probe of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions, under varying conditions of temperature, chemical potential, and magnetic fields.

Method: The study uses a one-loop resummed gluon propagator in imaginary-time formalism, incorporates phenomenological non-perturbative corrections to HTL, computes real/imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity, solves the Schrödinger equation for binding energies, and evaluates thermal decay widths via Landau damping.

Result: Temperature is the dominant factor affecting Debye screening, potential modification, and stability. Increased temperature reduces binding energies and increases thermal widths, establishing a suppression hierarchy among quarkonium states. Chemical potential and magnetic fields induce smaller quantitative changes but are still measurable.

Conclusion: Thermal effects are the principal cause of quarkonium dissociation in the QCD medium. However, finite chemical potential and weak magnetic fields can shift properties in observable ways, emphasizing the need for full consideration of these factors in heavy-ion collision analyses.

Abstract: We investigate the in-medium modification and dissociation of heavy quarkonium in a hot QCD medium at finite quark chemical potential and in the weak magnetic-field regime. Starting from the one-loop resummed gluon propagator in the imaginary-time formalism, and incorporating non-perturbative effects through a phenomenological correction to the HTL description, we compute the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity. This, in turn, leads to a complex heavy-quark potential: the real part is used to determine binding energies by solving the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation, while the imaginary part generates thermal decay widths, dominated by Landau damping. Within the explored parameter range, temperature has the greatest control over Debye screening, potential modification, and quarkonium stability, whereas finite density and weak magnetic fields introduce comparatively smaller quantitative changes. As the temperature increases, binding energies decrease and thermal widths grow, giving rise to the expected hierarchy between ground and excited states and a sequential suppression pattern in the dissociation temperatures. Overall, our results indicate that while finite chemical potential and weak magnetic fields can shift quarkonium properties in a measurable way, thermal effects remain the primary driver of dissociation, with direct relevance for heavy-ion collision phenomenology.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study presents a multiwavelength analysis of the young PWN G0.9+0.1, powered by PSR J1747-2809, revealing it as a potential leptonic PeVatron with electron energies up to 2 PeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the high-energy mechanisms and environment of the composite SNR/PWN system to understand particle acceleration and magnetic field dynamics in the Galactic Center.

Method: Combined NuSTAR X-ray data (up to 30 keV), multiwavelength observations (radio to TeV gamma rays), and SED modeling using one-zone and multi-zone leptonic models to characterize the PWN and pulsar properties.

Result: Confirmed synchrotron burnoff effect, derived a photon index of Γ=2.11, constrained the system's age (~2.2 kyr), and found electron spectral index p~2.6 with 2 PeV maximum energy, supporting the PeVatron hypothesis. Also detected renewed X-ray activity in a transient source nearby.

Conclusion: The PWN G0.9+0.1 is a strong candidate for a leptonic PeVatron due to extreme electron energies, highlighting its role in high-energy astrophysics and Galactic Center activity monitoring.

Abstract: We present a new X-ray study and multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the young pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by the energetic pulsar PSR J1747-2809, inside the composite supernova remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1, located in the Galactic Center region. The source is detected by NuSTAR up to 30 keV with evidence for the synchrotron burnoff effect in the changing spatial morphology with increasing energy. The broadband 2-30 keV spectrum of PWN G0.9+0.1 is modeled by a single power law with photon index $Γ=2.11\pm0.07$. We combined the new X-ray data with the multiwavelength observations in radio, GeV, and TeV gamma rays and modeled the SED, applying a one-zone and a multi-zone leptonic model. The comparison of the models is successful, as we obtained physically compatible results in the two cases. Through the one-zone model, we constrain the age of the system to $\sim2.2$ kyr, as well as reproduce the observed PWN and SNR radio sizes. In both the one-zone and multi-zone leptonic models, the electron injection spectrum is well-described by a single power law with spectral index $p \sim 2.6$ and a maximum electron energy of $\sim2$ PeV, suggesting the source could be a leptonic PeVatron candidate. We estimate the average magnetic field to be $B_{\rm PWN} \sim 20\ μ$G. We also report the serendipitous NuSTAR detection of renewed X-ray activity from the very faint X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 and characterize its spectrum.

*Edward Skrabacz,Lena Murchikova,Sean M. Ressler,Asad Ukani,Siddhant Solanki*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study finds that the gravitational potential of the nuclear star cluster (NSC) surrounding Sagittarius A* has negligible impact on the wind-fed accretion flow from Wolf-Rayet stars within 1 parsec scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies indicated that stellar winds from surrounding Wolf-Rayet stars significantly feed Sagittarius A*, but the role of the NSC's gravitational influence on this accretion process was unexplored and potentially critical.

Method: The authors analyzed the effects of the NSC's gravitational potential on accretion flows from WR stars orbiting near Sgr A*, using simulations or models that incorporated both the NSC's mass distribution and wind dynamics.

Result: Contrary to expectations, the NSC's gravitational influence was found to be insignificant at the parsec scale, meaning prior models ignoring the NSC are still valid for describing wind-fed accretion dynamics.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that the NSC's effect on Sgr A*'s accretion via WR stellar winds can be safely neglected in existing studies, justifying continued use of current simulation frameworks without NSC considerations at this spatial scale.

Abstract: The Milky Way's Galactic Center hosts the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which provides us with a close-up view into supermassive black hole accretion and feedback. Recent works have shown that the winds from $\sim 30$ Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting Sgr A* at about 4 arcsec are important contributors to feeding the supermassive black hole. A nuclear star cluster (NSC) with a mass of several $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$, of which $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ is within 1 pc, also surrounds Sgr A*. The NSC contributes to the gravitational potential in the Galactic Center, affecting the orbits of the WR stars and their stellar winds. In this work, we examine the effects that the NSC has on the accretion of these stellar winds onto Sgr A* which have previously been neglected. We find that, on the parsec scale, the effect from the gravitational potential of the NSC is negligible on the wind-fed accretion flow, validating the existing simulations used in the literature.

### [42] [Magnetic Pumping: Plasma Heating to Particle Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09807)
*Mikhail Malkov,Immanuel Jebaraj*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a nonperturbative approach to magnetic pumping (MP) for analyzing particle acceleration and plasma heating in astrophysical environments with strong magnetic turbulence. It introduces an exact closure method in the moment hierarchy to accurately model energy gain from magnetic oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous MP models which relied on sinusoidal field oscillations and perturbative methods, restricting their applicability to weak perturbations. The need exists to study systems with strong magnetic turbulence, such as astrophysical phenomena, where particle acceleration and plasma heating play significant roles.

Method: Develops a nonperturbative approach using a kinetic equation converted into a moment hierarchy. Introduces an exact closure at arbitrary levels of the moment system. The second-moment closure is solved exactly for heating, while higher moments are used for particle acceleration analysis in broadband random fields.

Result: Shows that MP can efficiently transfer energy to particles through momentum scattering during magnetic oscillations. The closure method accurately predicts energy retention post-scattering and enables calculation of power-law indices and maximum energies for accelerated particles in turbulent fields.

Conclusion: Nonperturbative MP analysis is essential for understanding plasma heating and particle acceleration in strongly turbulent astrophysical systems. The method provides a framework to extend MP applications to real-world scenarios beyond the scope of classical perturbative treatments.

Abstract: One of the earliest mechanisms proposed for plasma heating was magnetic pumping (MP). However, its significance for astrophysical phenomena, including particle acceleration, has yet to be appreciated. MP-energized particles tap energy from magnetic-field oscillations. A particle's momentum component perpendicular to the local B-field increases during field growth by virtue of the adiabatic invariant $p_{\perp}^{2}/B=const$. The gained $p_{\perp}$ is then partially scattered elastically into the parallel momentum, $p_{\parallel}$, with $p^{2}=p_{\parallel}^{2}+p_{\perp}^{2}=const$, thereby retaining some fraction of the gained energy before the field decreases to its minimum. This scattering breaks the reversibility of energy exchange between particles and oscillating magnetic fields, thereby increasing the particle energy after each MP cycle. Field oscillations are often assumed to be sinusoidal, and the resulting MP is treated perturbatively. These simplifications restrict astrophysical applications, leaving objects with strong magnetic perturbations outside the scope of adequate treatment. We develop a nonperturbative approach to MP that is suitable for a broad spectrum of magnetic turbulence. The treatment comprises two steps. The first step is common: converting a kinetic equation into an infinite hierarchy of moments of the particle distribution function. The second step is new in MP treatments: we find an exact closure at an arbitrary level of the moment system. The heating is treated exactly at the second-moment closure. Particle acceleration generally requires a higher-level closure to determine the power-law index and the maximum energy of accelerated particles. We propose a method for extracting these crucial acceleration data from the second moment for a broadband random field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess gravitational wave signals from known binary pulsars for current and future detectors, and to constrain astrophysical parameters like merger rates and common envelope efficiencies.

Method: Used post-Newtonian approximations to compute gravitational wave strains (3.0-73×10⁻²²), periastron advances (1.6-80.5 deg/yr), orbital period decay (-5 to -176 μs/yr), and derived common envelope parameters (αCE=0.63-1.16) sensitive to binding energy (λ).

Result: Derived merger rates of ~22.77 Myr⁻¹ in the Milky Way, consistent with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data. Showed multi-band gravitational wave observations can improve merger time predictions and neutron star physics understanding.

Conclusion: Multi-detector gravitational wave astronomy (LIGO/Virgo + LISA) enables precise tracking of binary pulsar evolution, merger timing, and parameter constraints for neutron star properties and common envelope processes.

Abstract: We summarize the current state of the art and calculate gravitational wave strain amplitudes for known binary pulsars, using data from current ground-based detectors (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA) and the upcoming space-based missions (LISA). We present detailed calculations of the characteristic gravitational wave strain values, ranging from 3.0 to 73 $\times10^{-22}$, across frequencies between 0.66 and 5.87 $\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Our post-Newtonian approximation analysis yields predicted periastron advance rates from 1.6 to 80.5 deg/yr and orbital period decay rates between -5 and -176 $μ$s/yr for the binary pulsar population. We derive common envelope efficiency parameters ($α_{CE}$) for representative progenitor scenarios within our sample, finding values between 0.63 and 1.16, with notable sensitivity to the binding energy parameter $λ$. Binary neutron star merger rates are estimated at $22.77^{+6.83}_{-6.83}$ Myr$^{-1}$ for the Milky Way, corresponding to a volumetric rate of $227.71^{+68.31}_{-68.31}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observational constraints. Our results illustrate how multi-band gravitational wave observations, from LIGO/Virgo to LISA, can contribute to precise measurements of binary pulsar strain and orbital evolution histories, improving merger time predictions and constraining neutron star physics and common envelope processes

### [44] [Dynamics of Apsidal Motion in Non-Synchronous Binary Pulsars Coupled Orbit and Spin Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09868)
*Ali Taani*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines relativistic and tidal effects on the apsidal motion of three binary pulsars, finding that gravitational wave emission, rather than tidal interactions, primarily drives orbital decay. Tidal effects are minor except in the double pulsar system, where synchronization occurs rapidly, while the most compact system shows negligible orbital changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe relativistic gravity, stellar structure, and dynamical evolution in close binary systems by analyzing how general relativity, stellar oblateness, and tidal interactions influence the apsidal motion of well-known binary pulsars.

Method: Applied Zahn's tidal equations for numerical integration to model tidal effects alongside relativistic and oblateness contributions. Estimated tidal synchronization and circularization timescales for PSR B1913+16, J0737-3039A/B, and J0621+1002.

Result: Gravitational wave emission dominates orbital decay over tidal effects. PSR 1913+16's orbital period decreases by ~76.5 μs/yr due to gravitational radiation. J0737-3039A/B synchronizes in ~8.4kyr, while J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital changes over 1e10 years. Apsidal motion constants (~k=0.1) align with theory, and tidal friction times (hours to days) match predictions.

Conclusion: Relativistic effects are dominant in neutron star binaries, with tidal interactions playing a minor role in orbital dynamics. Gravitational-wave terms must be included in models for accurate long-term orbital evolution predictions.

Abstract: The apsidal motion of a non-synchronous binary pulsar serves as a valuable probe of relativistic gravity, stellar stricture, and dynamical evolution of close binary systems, In this study, we investigate the combined influence of general relativity, stellar oblateness and tidal interaction on the apsidal motion of three binary pulsars: 1913+16, J0737-3039A/B, and J0621+1002. Zahn's tidal equations \cite{1977A&A....57..383Z, 1989A&A...220..112Z} were employed for numerical integrations to describe tidal effects and their role in orbital and spin evolution. We estimated the timescales for tidal synchronization and orbital circularization for each system. The results indicate that tidal effects play only a minor role in orbital decay compared with energy loss due to gravitational wave emission. This is evident in the compact system PSR 1913+16, where the orbital period decreases by approximately 76.5 $μ$s/yr as a result of gravitational radiation. The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B exhibits faster orbital evolution, with synchronization occurring in about 8.4$\times10{^3}$ years, whereas the wider system J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital change over timescales exceeding 10$^{10}$ years. The simulations demonstrate clear trends of decreasing semi-major axis and eccentricity, accompanied by an increase in spin rate among the binary pulsars studied. The derived apsidal motion constants [$k\simeq0.1$] are consistent with theoretical expected values, and the corresponding tidal friction times (between a few hours to several days) agree well with theoretical predication. These results emphasize the dominant role of relativistic effects in neutron star binaries and highlight the importance of including gravitational-wave terms long-term orbital evolution

### [45] [Multimessenger Prospects for Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts: Joint Neutrino and X-Ray Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10317)
*Wenkang Lian,He Gao,Shunke Ai,B. Theodore Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of joint X-ray and neutrino observations for probing low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) using next-generation neutrino telescopes. It finds that while individual detections are limited to nearby sources, stacking multiple magnetized LLGRBs can significantly extend the observable distance and improve detection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of detected neutrino coincidences with LLGRBs by leveraging advancements in X-ray astronomy and upcoming neutrino telescopes with enhanced sensitivity. This could provide a new multimessenger probe for understanding LLGRB dynamics and neutrino production.

Method: The researchers modeled the jet dynamics and neutrino production of non-magnetized and magnetized LLGRB outflows. They calculated detection limits for individual events and stacked samples using a next-gen neutrino telescope with 30x IceCube's effective area.

Result: For non-magnetized scenarios, individual LLGRBs with $10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ can be detected up to 160 Mpc ($\sim1$/year). Magnetized sources are limited to 65 Mpc ($\sim0.5$/year). Stacking 100 magnetized events extends reach to 700 Mpc with $\sim2$/year detection rate.

Conclusion: Joint X-ray and next-gen neutrino observations offer a viable multimessenger approach to study LLGRBs, particularly through stacking techniques which enhance detection capabilities for magnetized outflows over larger cosmic distances.

Abstract: Low--luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) are promising candidates for high-energy neutrinos, yet no coincident neutrino events have been detected so far. Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\sim1.6\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D_L\sim6.5\times10^{1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim1\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D_L\lesssim7.0\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year. These results demonstrate that joint X-ray and next-generation neutrino observations enable a practical multimessenger probe of LLGRBs.

### [46] [Long Period Transients (LPTs): a comprehensive review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10393)
*Nanda Rea,Natasha Hurley-Walker,Manisha Caleb*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper discusses Long Period Transients (LPTs), mysterious sources with periodic radio bursts, and evaluates existing hypotheses about their origin, highlighting unresolved questions in explaining their characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical mechanisms behind LPTs' unique properties, including their periodic radio emissions, high polarization, and transient activity periods, which current theories cannot fully explain.

Method: Review of observational data and theoretical models of LPTs, analyzing proposed scenarios (binary systems, magnetars, white dwarfs) and their successes/limitations in reproducing observed phenomena.

Result: No single model fully explains LPTs' radio emission characteristics. Some sources align with white dwarf binaries, others with magnetar-like X-ray activity, but key questions remain unresolved.

Conclusion: LPTs represent an unresolved astrophysical puzzle requiring more observational data and refined theoretical models to determine their true nature and underlying physics.

Abstract: Long Period Transients (LPTs) are a recently identified class of sources characterized by periodic radio bursts lasting seconds to minutes, with flux densities that might reach several tens of Jy. These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients.

### [47] [On the Physical Origins of the Millimeter Fundamental Plane in Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10612)
*Kratika Mazde,Angelo Ricarte,George N. Wong*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that compact, hot accretion flows with strong magnetic fields can explain observed correlations between millimeter/X-ray luminosities and black hole mass in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN). Using GRMHD simulations and ray-tracing, they show that inverse Compton scattering dominates X-ray production and that the observed correlations hold naturally for models with Eddington ratios similar to observed objects, without needing parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical origin of observed correlations between millimeter/X-ray luminosities and black hole mass in AGN, and to test whether accretion flow models with magnetic fields can explain these relationships without tuning parameters.

Method: Performed general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations with dynamically significant magnetic fields, followed by ray-tracing to compute multi-wavelength spectra (synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, Compton scattering). Compared model predictions against observed correlations for low-luminosity AGN with varying Eddington ratios.

Result: Models with Eddington ratios matching observed objects reproduce luminosity correlations naturally. Lower Eddington ratio models deviate, suggesting observational bias against low accretion rates. Inverse Compton scattering dominates X-ray emission in all correlation-conforming models. Spin has only modest influence on the relationship.

Conclusion: Hot, magnetized accretion flows explain observed multiwavelength properties in low-luminosity AGN. Future work must address non-thermal electrons, weaker magnetic fields, and radiative cooling effects.

Abstract: Observations of active galactic nuclei have revealed a correlation between millimeter luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and mass, suggesting the emission in each of these bands is powered by a common source. Starting with a set of five general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with dynamically important magnetic fields, we perform ray-tracing calculations to produce spectra including synchrotron emission, bremsstrahlung emission, and Compton scattering. Our models with similar Eddington ratios to the objects for which the relationship was inferred naturally reproduce observations without tuning. Our lower Eddington ratio models depart from this relationship, likely attributable to an observational bias against extremely low accretion rates. We find that inverse Compton scattering dominates the production of X-rays over bremsstrahlung radiation in almost all models, and in all models consistent with the observed correlation. We find only a modest spin dependence in this relationship. This study demonstrates that a compact, hot accretion flow with dynamically important magnetic fields can naturally explain observed millimeter and X-ray properties in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Future work should explore the impacts of non-thermal electron populations, weaker magnetic fields, and radiative cooling.
