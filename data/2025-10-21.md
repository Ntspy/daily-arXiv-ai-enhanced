Abstract: The Georgi-Glashow model is the simplest possible attempt at grand
unification. However, due to its particle content, it preserves a global
$U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, where $B$ and $L$ are baryon and lepton numbers,
respectively. It thus leaves neutrinos massless just as in the Standard Model.
Extensions of the Georgi-Glashow model that break lepton number by two units,
i.e., scenarios with $|\Delta L|=2$ operator(s), naturally generate potentially
viable Majorana neutrino masses. Consequently, $B-L$ breaking via the same
dynamics that yields $|\Delta L| = 2$ interactions unavoidably induces $|\Delta
B| = 2$ transitions, leading to intriguing processes such as
neutron-antineutron ($n$-$\overline{n}$) oscillation. We demonstrate this
intrinsic connection between neutrino mass generation and $n$-$\overline{n}$
oscillation within tree-level seesaw mechanisms of the Type I, II, and III
varieties, as well as in the one-loop and two-loop radiative neutrino mass
models. Our study exhausts the simplest possible extensions of the
Georgi-Glashow model that yield realistic neutrino masses and mixing parameters
and, in the process, induce $n$-$\overline{n}$ oscillation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work explores the potential of the proposed FASER2 experiment at the LHC
to determine the properties of a discovered heavy neutral lepton (HNL),
including its mass, couplings, and whether it is a Majorana or Dirac fermion.
We first consider a Majorana HNL with mass $m_N = 1.84\,\rm{GeV}$ that is
primarily produced through decays $D \to \mu N$ at the ATLAS interaction point.
Such HNLs may travel macroscopic distances in the far-forward direction and
then decay, yielding approximately 8600 $N \to \mu \pi$ decays in FASER2 at the
High-Luminosity LHC. With FASER2 measurements alone, the HNL's mass and
couplings can be measured to fractional uncertainties of approximately 0.1% and
3% at 95% CL, respectively, and the Dirac fermion hypothesis can be rejected at
99.8% CL. We then consider a second, more difficult, case of a Majorana HNL
with mass $m_N = 2.00\,\rm{GeV}$, yielding only 80 $N \to \mu \pi$ decays in
FASER2. With FASER2 alone, measurements of HNL properties are still possible,
but somewhat less precise. However, by using FASER2 as a trigger for ATLAS and
measuring the charge of the muon produced in association with the HNL at ATLAS
to search for lepton number violation, one can precisely measure the HNL's
properties and reject the Dirac fermion hypothesis at 99.7% CL. These results
show that FASER2, sometimes in coordination with ATLAS, can precisely determine
HNL properties, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of
neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and the fundamental symmetries of nature.

### [3] [A new determination of $α_s (M_τ^2)$ and higher-order QCD corrections to hadronic $τ$ decays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16119)
*Gauhar Abbas,Vartika Singh*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses Levin-type sequence transformations to accelerate the convergence of QCD perturbative series for determining the strong coupling constant α_s(M_τ²) from hadronic τ decays. It provides precise estimates of α_s and higher-order coefficients, showing the effectiveness of this method for handling asymptotic series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the divergence issues of inverted perturbative series in QCD corrections and improve the accuracy of extracting α_s from τ decay data, especially regarding higher-order uncertainties.

Method: Applies Levin-type sequence transformations to both the fixed-order expansion of δ^(0) in α_s and its inverse series, allowing resummation of divergent terms and stabilization of the α_s determination.

Result: Obtained α_s^Levin-FOPT = 0.3159 ± 0.0018 ± 0.0023 and predicted higher-order coefficients c_{5,1}, c_{6,1}, c_{7,1} with uncertainties, consistent with existing analyses.

Conclusion: Levin-type transformations offer a robust framework for analyzing asymptotic perturbative series in QCD, enhancing the extraction of α_s from τ decay data and providing reliable estimates of higher-order corrections.

Abstract: We employ \textit{Levin-type sequence transformations} to accelerate the
convergence of the perturbative fixed-order expansion of the QCD correction
$\delta^{(0)}$ in terms of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, and of the inverted
series expressing $\alpha_s$ in powers of $\delta^{(0)}$. The method
efficiently resums the divergent inverted series, yielding a stable and
self-consistent determination of the strong coupling at the $\tau$ mass scale.
It also provides reliable estimates of higher-order QCD corrections to hadronic
$\tau$ decays, consistent with existing results. We find
$\alpha_s^{\text{Levin-FOPT}} = 0.3159 \pm 0.0018 \, \pm 0.0023 \, $, and
predict $c_{5,1} = 269^{+47}_{-45}, \quad c_{6,1} = 3185^{+117}_{-279}, \quad
c_{7,1} = (1.9^{+0.9}_{-0.8}) \times 10^4.$ Our results demonstrate that
Levin-type transformations provide an efficient framework for analyzing
asymptotic perturbative series and improving the extraction of
$\alpha_s(M_\tau^2)$ from hadronic $\tau$ decays.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present an analysis of parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The MCMC approach naturally
implements Bayes' theorem and thus provides a means to directly sample the
underlying probability distribution - in this case the probability distribution
of the PDF parameters. This allows for a straightforward propagation of the
resulting uncertainties into any PDF-dependent observable, preserving their
simple probabilistic interpretation. In our analysis we include a broad set of
deep inelastic scattering data from HERA, BCDMS and NMC experiments along with
the Drell-Yan, $W$ and $Z$ boson data from LHC and Tevatron experiments, which
combined with theoretical calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD
allow for realistic determination of PDFs. The main focus of this analysis is
to explore alternative methods for PDF uncertainty estimation that are more
firmly grounded in statistical principles. We show that the flexibility of the
Bayes framework, allowing e.g. to account for non-Gaussianity or
inconsistencies of data sets, is crucial to extract realistic uncertainties
when such assumptions are not fulfilled. We also demonstrate that MCMC allows
one to determine the $\Delta \chi^2$ value corresponding to a given confidence
level in the sample, which can in turn be used as a statistically well-founded
tolerance criterion used in the Hessian method, thus addressing one of its main
long-standing drawbacks.

### [5] [Axion condensates in neutron stars and radial oscillation modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16245)
*Antonio Gómez-Bañón,Pantelis Pnigouras,José A. Pons*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates how axion condensates in neutron stars affect their structure and radial oscillations, identifying two mode families and suggesting a new method for axion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of axion condensates on neutron star structure and oscillations, providing a potential new probe for axion properties.

Method: Used BSk26 equation of state and solved coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and Klein-Gordon equations with linear perturbation analysis.

Result: Found two quasi-normal mode families (fluid-dominated and axion modes), axion-induced damping with ~second decay timescales for kHz axion masses, and frequency-dependent damping effects.

Conclusion: Stellar oscillations can serve as a novel 'axion asteroseismology' tool to study axion properties in neutron stars.

Abstract: Light QCD axions, introduced to solve the strong CP problem, may form
condensates inside neutron stars, giving rise to a novel ground state of dense
matter. We investigate how such axion condensates modify the equilibrium
structure and radial oscillation spectrum of NSs. Using a realistic NS model
with the BSk26 equation of state, and solving the coupled
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and Klein-Gordon equations together with a linear
perturbation analysis, we find two distinct families of quasi-normal modes:
weakly damped fluid-dominated oscillations and highly damped axion modes. The
coupling between the fluid and the axion field introduces axion-induced damping
of radial oscillations, with decay timescales of order seconds for kHz axion
masses. Modes with frequencies above the axion mass are strongly damped, while
those below remain unaffected. These results suggest that stellar oscillations
could provide a novel probe of axion properties, opening prospects for axion
asteroseismology in neutron stars.

### [6] [Nucleon axial form factors in generalized nonlocal chiral effective theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16528)

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we first investigate the chiral transformation properties of
the nonlocal pion field operator and construct a generalized nonlocal chiral
Lagrangian that is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ chiral symmetry
transformations. As a simple application, we then calculate the leading and
next-leading order pion one loop corrections to the nucleon axial form factors
within nonlocal chiral perturbation theory. Then, we fit the next leading order
and next-next leading order low energy coupling constants (LECs) to lattice QCD
data. The fitted results show that the nonlocal LECs are comparatively smaller
than their local counterparts. Finally, using these LECs, we compute the
$Q^{2}$ dependence of the nucleon axial form factors. The numerical results
indicate that the nonlocal nucleon axial form factors are consistent with
lattice QCD data in a wide $\rm Q^{2}$ range, up to $\rm Q^{2} =
1~\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$

### [7] [Semileptonic decay and form factors of $Ω_b^- \rightarrow Ω_c^0\,e\,\bar{ν_e}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16529)
*Kinjal Patel,Kaushal Thakkar*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyses the semileptonic decay Ω_b^- → Ω_c^0 e^- \bar{ν}_e using the Hypercentral Constituent Quark Model (HCQM), incorporating HQET form factors with 1/m_Q corrections. Results for decay width and branching ratio are compared with other theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decays beyond the heavy quark symmetry limit, incorporating finite mass effects through 1/m_Q corrections, and validate the HCQM against existing theoretical models.

Method: Numerically solves the 6D hyperradial Schrödinger equation with hyper-Coulomb and linear confinement potentials, calculates HQET form factors to subleading order (including 1/m_Q terms), and uses helicity formalism to compute decay rates.

Result: Computed decay width and branching ratio values are found to align closely with predictions from other theoretical approaches, demonstrating the HCQM's reliability in modeling heavy baryon transitions.

Conclusion: The HCQM effectively captures heavy baryon decay dynamics when including subleading HQET corrections, providing a consistent framework for analyzing heavy-to-heavy semileptonic processes and agreeing with existing theoretical results.

Abstract: We investigate the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay $\Omega_b^- \rightarrow
\Omega_c^0\,e\,\bar{\nu_e}$ within the framework of the Hypercentral
Constituent Quark Model (HCQM). The ground state masses of the involved baryons
are evaluated by numerically solving the six-dimensional hyperradial
Schr\"{o}dinger equation, incorporating both hyper-Coulomb and linear
confinement potentials along with spin-dependent interactions. The Heavy Quark
Effective Field Theory (HQET) form factors are computed up to the subleading
order, incorporating $1/m_Q$ corrections that account for finite mass effects
beyond the heavy quark symmetry limit. These form factors are then employed to
analyse the heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rate via helicity formalism. Our
results for the decay width and branching ratio are compared with those from
various theoretical approaches.

### [8] [Heavy flavor transport in the QGP medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16653)
*Bruno Scheihing-Hitschfeld*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper reviews recent advancements in understanding heavy flavor transport in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through two approaches: individual heavy quark transport using heavy quark effective theory and quarkonium transport involving Generalized Gluon Distributions in pNRQCD. Key focuses include kinetic equilibration conditions linked to Wilson loops, non-Markovian effects in quarkonium dynamics, and the need for improved modeling of their interactions with the QGP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance theoretical frameworks for describing heavy flavor dynamics in extreme conditions like those in heavy-ion collisions, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative QCD regimes, and addressing unresolved challenges in equilibration and non-Markovian interactions.

Method: The study employs heavy quark effective theory to connect transport equations with Wilson loop expectation values for single heavy quarks. For quarkonia, Generalized Gluon Distributions are derived within potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) to model their interactions with the QGP, emphasizing non-Markovian effects.

Result: Key results include mapped equilibration dynamics of heavy quarks in strongly coupled media and demonstrated necessity of considering memory effects in quarkonium-QGP interactions. However, systematic analysis of non-Markovian impacts remains incomplete.

Conclusion: The work highlights progress in heavy flavor transport theory but underscores the need for further exploration of non-Markovian effects and systematic incorporation into collision models to accurately describe quarkonium behavior in heavy-ion environments.

Abstract: I review recent developments on heavy flavor transport in the QGP medium,
along two directions. The first is the transport of individual open heavy
quarks. Leveraging the tools of heavy quark effective theory, recent work
revealed a novel connection between the evolution equation of the heavy quark
phase space distribution, the conditions for kinetic equilibration to take
place, and a non-perturbatively defined expectation value of a Wilson loop
characterized by the heavy quark velocity. Using these developments, I discuss
results from a first exploration of the ensuing stopping and equilibration
dynamics of heavy quarks in a strongly coupled environment. The second
direction is the transport of quarkonia, bound states of heavy quarks, where
novel Generalized Gluon Distributions have been recently defined and calculated
in the framework of potential non-relativistic QCD. I discuss their application
to the dynamics of quarkonium in heavy-ion collisions, highlighting the need to
account for non-Markovian effects in the interactions between the heavy quark
pair and quark-gluon plasma -- which have thus far resisted a systematic
characterization.

*Nishat Fiza,Mehedi Masud,Kim Siyeon,Guang Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The EIC proton beam's fraction can create a high-intensity GeV-scale neutrino beam for long-baseline oscillation studies, enhancing CP violation sensitivity and complementing EIC's scientific goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of using the EIC proton beam for generating a neutrino beam, leveraging its 1 MW fraction to advance neutrino oscillation studies and CP violation detection.

Method: Simulated proton-target interactions, optimized neutrino fluxes for WbLS detectors at 900 km and 2900 km baselines, and performed oscillation analyses with GLoBES to assess sensitivity.

Result: Extended baselines improve access to multiple oscillation maxima, enhancing CP violation detection. Matter effects and CP phase interplay were analyzed, showing strong observational asymmetries.

Conclusion: The EIC proton beam offers a novel, complementary approach for precision neutrino physics, extending the EIC's scientific capabilities beyond its primary nucleon structure studies.

Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a next-generation accelerator primarily
designed to study the internal structure of nucleons through high-precision
electron-hadron collisions. In this work, we explore the feasibility of
employing a 1 MW fraction of the EIC proton beam to generate a high-intensity
GeV-scale neutrino beam for long-baseline oscillation studies. We have
simulated proton-target interactions and optimize the resulting neutrino fluxes
for water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) detectors located at distinct
baselines of 900 km and at 2900 km. Oscillation analyses performed with GLoBES
show that extended baselines allow access to multiple oscillation maxima,
significantly enhancing sensitivity to leptonic CP violation. The study also
examines the interplay between matter effects and the intrinsic CP violating
phase in shaping observable asymmetries. These results suggest that the EIC
proton beam could provide a novel and complementary source for precision
neutrino physics, extending the scientific reach of the EIC program.

### [10] [A Way of Axion Detection with Mass $10^{-4} \text{-}10^{-3}$eV Using Cylindrical Sample with Low Electric Conductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16746)
*Aiichi Iwazaki*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses how the conductivity of a cylindrical material affects the detection of dark matter axions. For low-conductive materials (e.g., σ=10⁻³ eV), axion energy dissipates in the bulk, allowing detection via an LC circuit with high sensitivity in the mass range 10⁻⁴–10⁻³ eV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective methods for detecting axion dark matter by analyzing energy dissipation mechanisms in different material conductivities and optimizing experimental setups.

Method: The study examines cylindrical samples under magnetic fields, comparing high vs. low conductivity materials. It uses the QCD axion model to calculate dissipated power and applies an LC circuit with Q=10⁶ to achieve high signal-to-noise ratios at low temperatures.

Result: The dissipated power formula is derived, showing dependence on conductivity, geometry, magnetic field, and axion properties. Detection feasibility is confirmed for axion masses between 10⁻⁴-10⁻³ eV with a signal-to-noise ratio ~10.

Conclusion: Low-conductivity cylinders enable bulk energy dissipation, enhancing axion detection. The proposed experimental setup (optimized LC circuit, low temp, 60s observation) significantly improves detection prospects in the specified mass range.

Abstract: A dark matter axion with mass $m_a$ induces an oscillating electric field in
a cylindrical sample placed under a magnetic field $B$ parallel to the cylinder
axis. When the cylinder is made of a highly electrically conductive material,
the induced oscillating current primarily dissipates the axion energy at the
surface. In contrast, if the cylinder is composed of a material with low
conductivity, e.g. $\sigma = 10^{-3}\text{eV}$, the axion energy is dissipated
mainly inside the bulk of the cylinder. Within the QCD axion model, the
dissipated power $P$ is estimated as $P \simeq 2.8\times 10^{-28}\text{W}
g_{\gamma}^2 \left(L/100\text{cm}\right)\left(R/2\text{cm}\right)^2
\left(m_a/10^{-4}\text{eV}\right)
\left(B/10\text{T}\right)^2\left(10/\epsilon\right)
\left(\rho_a/0.3\text{GeVcm}^{-3}\right)$, with $\sigma= 10^{-3}$eV, radius
$R$, length $L$, electric permittivity $\epsilon = 10$ of the cylinder and
axion energy density $\rho_a$, where $g_{\gamma}(\text{KSVZ}) = -0.96$ and
$g_{\gamma}(\text{DFSZ}) = 0.37$. Using an LC circuit appropriately tuned to a
quality factor $Q = 10^6$, the signal-to-noise ratio at low temperature $100$mK
and observation time $60$sec. is so large $\sim 10$ that the detection of dark
matter axions is feasible in the mass range $m_a
=10^{-4}\text{-}10^{-3}\text{eV}$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent report by CMS Collaboration on the excess of top and anti-top pair
production is studied, under the hypothesis of the coexistence of a toponium
$(\eta_t)$ and an additional elementary field $(\Psi)$. We examine the scenario
where toponium and an additional field are mixed, and consider the plausible
scenarios in that case. Two scenarios are examined: one is the minimal model
with $\Psi$ close to the inert Higgs doublet, and the other is embedded into
the two Higgs doublet models (2HDM), where $\Psi$ is one of the two Higgs
scalars after transforming the basis. The value of the each coupling constant
is restricted by the Multicritical Point Principle (MPP). Consistency with the
data gives constraints on a mixing angle $\theta\
(-45^\circ\le\theta\le45^\circ)$, with which the mass eigenstate $\Psi^\prime$
contributing to the excess is defined by $\Psi^\prime=\Psi\cos \theta +
\eta_t\sin \theta$. The obtained results are $|\theta| \le 17^{\circ}$ for the
minimum scenario, and $|\theta| \le 1^{\circ}$ for the second scenario of
2HDM(Type II and Y). We also briefly discuss the comparison with Type I and X.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The chromo-magnetic monopoles (CMM), emergent topological excitations of
non-Abelian gauge fields carrying chromo-magnetic charge, have long been
postulated to play an important role in the vacuum confinement of quantum
chromodynamics (QCD), the deconfinement transition at temperature $T_c\approx
160\rm MeV$, as well as the strongly coupled nature of quark-gluon plasma
(QGP). While such CMMs have been found to provide solutions for challenging
puzzles from heavy-ion collision measurements, they were typically introduced
as model assumptions in the past. Here we show how their very existence can be
determined and their abundance extracted in a data-driven way for the first
time. Using the \textsc{cujet3} framework for calculations of jet energy loss
and analyzing a comprehensive experimental data set for nuclear modification
factor ($R_{\mathrm{AA}}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of
high-transverse-momentum hadrons, the fraction of CMMs in the QGP is obtained
by Bayesian inference and is found to be substantial in the $1\sim 2 T_c$
region. The posterior CMM fraction is further validated by excellent agreement
with additional data and is also shown to predict QGP transport properties
quantitatively consistent with the state-of-the-art knowledge.

*Liang Chen,Thomas W. Kephart*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates high-density axion clusters under gravitational compression, showing they can rapidly convert into photons with distinctive signals, potentially linking to fast radio bursts and possibly forming black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fate of high-density axion clusters and their observable signatures, such as photon emissions and potential black hole formation, which could explain phenomena like fast radio bursts.

Method: The study involves analyzing the gravitational compression of axion clusters, estimating photon conversion rates, and calculating remnant masses to determine if black holes form. They also correlate photon signal patterns with fast radio burst characteristics.

Result: Simulations show axions convert rapidly into photons under compression, with some configurations producing identifiable photon patterns. Remnant masses suggest possible black hole formation, and emitted photons may correspond to certain fast radio bursts.

Conclusion: High-density axion clusters under gravitational collapse can generate detectable photon signals linked to fast radio bursts and might form black holes, offering new avenues for observational tests of axion physics.

Abstract: We examine high-density axion clusters under gravitational compression. These
are transient events in which the majority of axions are rapidly converted into
photons, with some configurations producing photon signals with distinctive and
characteristic patterns. We estimated the mass of the remnant objects and note
that some could be black holes while in some cases it may be possible to
identify the emitted photons with a robust class of fast radio bursts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work we shall study the impact of a second order electroweak phase
transition occurring at $\sim 150\,$GeV on the energy spectrum of the
stochastic gravitational background. Specifically, we assume that the
non-minimally coupled Higgs field controls the inflationary era, we find the
reheating temperature for the Higgs inflationary model and we demonstrate that
the Higgs effective potential exhibits a very weak first order phase
transition. This weak first order phase transition is an indication that the
electroweak phase transition may not actually proceed as a first order phase
transition, but it will proceed as a crossover or second order phase
transition. This second order phase transition proceeds with the Higgs field
slow-rolling its potential toward to its new minimum. This slow-rolling may
deform the radiation domination total equation of state, and the aim of this
work is to pinpoint the observational imprints of this total equation of state
deformation on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves, that
affects modes that enter the horizon at temperatures $T\sim 150\,$GeV or lower.

Motivation: To address the unclear assignments of these $3^{++}$ light meson states and provide a systematic analysis of their mass spectra and decay patterns, which are important for understanding meson spectroscopy and quark model predictions.

Method: Employ the modified Godfrey-Isgur quark model to calculate mass spectra and the quark-pair creation model for analyzing two-body strong decays. Compare theoretical results with experimental data to identify the mentioned meson states and predict properties of higher excitations.

Result: Proposed identifications of the listed $a_3$ and $f_3$ states through mass and decay analysis. Predicted masses and decay widths for higher $3^{++}$ meson excitations, enhancing existing meson family classifications.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the assignments of observed $3^{++}$ mesons and offers predictions that guide future experimental searches, contributing to the advancement of light meson spectroscopy and quark model applications.

Abstract: As members of the $J^{PC}=3^{++}$ light meson family, the assignments of the
$a_3(1875)$, $a_3(2030)$, $a_3(2275)$, $f_3(2050)$, and $f_3(2300)$ states
remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the mass spectra and the
Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-allowed two-body strong decays of the $3^{++}$ light meson
family using the modified Godfrey-Isgur quark model and the quark-pair creation
model. We explore the identification of the $a_3(1875)$, $a_3(2030)$,
$a_3(2275)$, $f_3(2050)$, and $f_3(2300)$ states. Additionally, we predict the

### [16] [Possibility To Study Photon Scattering By Proton In The Reaction e+p -> e+p+gamma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17008)
*A. I. Lvov,V. A. Petrunkin,S. G. Popov,B. B. Wojtsekhowski*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the possibility of measuring proton Compton scattering cross sections using ep→epγ reactions in kinematics with small transverse momentum transfer to the electron. By selecting events where the photon and proton are detected and reconstructing their kinematics, the method aims to isolate Compton scattering from bremsstrahlung background, enabling precise determination of proton polarizabilities with a projected count rate of ~10³ events/hour at NEP-like luminosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately measure proton polarizabilities and study energy/angular dependencies of γp scattering cross sections while distinguishing signal from bremsstrahlung background.

Method: Use the ep→epγ reaction at a high-luminosity facility (e.g., NEP) to detect photon and proton in final state. Apply kinematical cuts to exclude regions with forward photons and extreme photon energies, allowing full event reconstruction. This isolates Compton scattering events from bremsstrahlung background.

Result: Projected count rate of ~10³ events/hour at L≈2×10³⁵ cm⁻²s⁻¹. Enables detailed cross-section measurement and high-statistics determination of proton polarizabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method is viable for precise measurement of proton polarizabilities through proton Compton scattering with achievable event rates at next-generation facilities like NEP.

Abstract: A theoretical possibility to determine the proton Compton scattering cross
section from the reaction $ep\rightarrow ep\gamma$ is studied in the kinematics
with a small transversal momentum transfer in the electron leg. With the
exception of the region of forward photon directions and extreme photon
energies close to the maximum ones or zero, registration of the particles
$\gamma$ and $p$ in the final state can enable one to distinguish the
sub-process of the Compton scattering from the electron bremsstrahlung
background and, owing to complete kinematical reconstruction of each individual
event, measure in detail energy and angular dependence of the $\gamma
p$-scattering cross section. The count rate expected with a storage ring like
NEP having luminosity $L \approx 2 \cdot 10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}\cdot$ sec$^{-1}$ as
projected is $\approx 10^3$ events/hour. Such measurements might help to
determine proton polarizabilities with high statistical accuracy.

Abstract: There is a claim in the literature that charged dark matter particles in the
mass range $100 (q_{\rm X}/e)^2~\mathrm{TeV} \leq m_{\rm X} \leq 10^8 (q_{\rm
X}/e)~\mathrm{TeV}$ are allowed, based on arguing that heavy charged particles
cannot reach the Earth from outside the magnetized region of the Milky Way
(Chuzhoy-Kolb, 2009). We point out that this claim fails for physical models
for the Galactic magnetic field. We explicitly confirm our argument by
simulating with the software CRPropa the trajectories of heavy charged dark
matter in models of the Galactic magnetic field.

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of present and future direct detection
experiments to generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) through elastic neutrino
electron scattering. Using data from LUX-ZEPLIN, PandaX-4T, and XENONnT, we
derive constraints on vector, axial-vector, scalar, and tensor effective
couplings, and compare them with existing limits. Our results show that current
xenon-based detectors already provide competitive bounds, with XENONnT offering
the most stringent constraints due to its larger exposure and reduced
backgrounds. Among the GNI couplings, the scalar contributions remain more
weakly constrained, while tensor interactions yield the strongest limits. We
also present projected sensitivities for the DARWIN experiment, showing
potential improvements. These results demonstrate the capability of direct
detection experiments, originally designed for dark matter searches, to provide
complementary and competitive constraints on generalized neutrino interactions.

*E. Maciel,M. A. Anacleto,K. E. L. Farias,E. Passos*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines relativistic spin-half particle dynamics in a Lorentz-violating background using an effective field theory approach. A modified Dirac Hamiltonian with a CPT-odd SME coupling leads to an effective Lorentz-force-like force. Analysis of a Penning trap system predicts a measurable cyclotron frequency shift, yielding a Lorentz-violating coupling upper limit of gu ≤ 10^-18 eV^-1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore observable effects of Lorentz violation in high-precision Penning trap experiments and constrain the corresponding SME parameters using relativistic effective field theory.

Method: Derivation of velocity and force operators via Heisenberg equations, application of Ehrenfest's theorem/correspondence principle to obtain classical dynamics, and simulation of Penning trap trajectories considering Lorentz-violating corrections.

Result: Identified a cyclotron frequency correction leading to observable trajectory deviations. Derived an upper bound gu ≤ 10^-18 eV^-1 for Lorentz-violating coupling strength.

Conclusion: Relativistic effective models provide a powerful tool for probing new physics via Lorentz violation. Penning traps offer exceptional sensitivity for testing fundamental symmetries like Lorentz invariance.

Abstract: We investigate the relativistic dynamics of a spin half particle in the
presence of a Lorentz violating background within the framework of effective
field theory. A modified Dirac Hamiltonian is considered, arising from a CPT
odd coupling involving the Lorentz violating gauge tensor of the Standard Model
Extension (SME). The velocity and effective force operators are derived from
the Heisenberg equations of motion. Using Ehrenfest s theorem and the
correspondence principle, we obtain the classical limit of the dynamics and
identify an effective force exhibiting a generalized Lorentz force structure.
This formalism is applied to a Penning trap system, known for its high
precision measurements of charged particle properties. Our analysis shows that
the effective cyclotron frequency acquires a correction due to the Lorentz
violating term, leading to deviations in the particle trajectory and offering a
potentially observable signature of Lorentz violation in precision experiments.
By comparing our results with current bounds from high precision Penning traps,
we establish an upper limit on the Lorentz violating coupling, $gu\leq
10^{-18}\text{eV}^{-1}$. These results highlight the potential of relativistic
effective models to probe new physics and reinforce the role of Penning traps
as sensitive tools for testing Lorentz symmetry.

*Takaaki Nomura,Hiroshi Okada,Yoshihiro Shigekami*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a radiatively induced lepton mass model using a $Z_2$ gauged $Z_5$ fusion rule, generating charged-lepton masses at one loop without breaking the fusion rule, while neutrino masses are induced at one loop without breaking it. Phenomenological implications like lepton flavor violations, $g-2$ anomalies, and electric dipole moments are analyzed through numerical results tied to CP phases and experimental constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the origins of lepton masses and mixing, particularly radiative generation mechanisms, and explore their observable consequences such as LFV processes and CP violation signatures compatible with experimental data.

Method: A $Z_2$ gauged $Z_5$ symmetry model is constructed where charged-lepton masses arise from loop effects during fusion rule breaking, while neutrino masses are loop-induced without symmetry breaking. Numerical analysis evaluates model parameters against experimental constraints on masses, mixing angles, and CP phases.

Result: Numerical results show correlations between CP phases (Dirac and Majorana), charged-lepton electric dipole moments, and neutrinoless double beta decay rates. Parameters are fixed to match observed lepton data, revealing model-dependent tendencies in phenomenological observables.

Conclusion: The model successfully explains lepton mass hierarchies via radiative mechanisms and predicts testable signatures in LFV, $g-2$, and CP violation experiments, offering a viable framework for understanding neutrino physics and lepton sector dynamics.

Abstract: We propose a radiatively induced lepton mass model introducing a $Z_2$
gauging $Z_5$ fusion rule. In our framework, the charged-lepton mass matrix is
generated at one loop level via dynamical breaking of the fusion rule. On the
other hand, the neutrino mass matrix is induced at one-loop level without
breaking the fusion rule. As a direct consequence of the loop induced charged
lepton masses, we can also consider lepton flavor violations, electron and muon
$g-2$, and charged-lepton electric dipole moments that come into our valid
phenomenological discussion. Then, we perform numerical analysis and show some
interesting tendency on Dirac CP phase, two Majorana phases, charged-lepton
electric dipole moments and the neutrinoless double beta decay, all of which
depends on their arguments where we fix the absolute values of our free
parameters in order to satisfy experimental data of the lepton masses and
mixing angles.

Abstract: Building on the first-ever application of neural networks in TMD
phenomenology: "Extraction of the Sivers function with deep neural networks",
we now present a momentum space, physics-informed deep learning framework for
the direct extraction of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton
distributions (TMDs) from fixed target Drell-Yan data (E288, E605). Rather than
transforming to impact-parameter space, we remain in k and embed a normalized
integrand s(x, k; Q) whose auto-convolution produces the observed qT spectra.
The extraction proceeds in two steps. Stage I learns the structure kernel S(qT
, x1, x2; QM ) by regressing the cross-section with known kinematic prefactors
and charge-weighted PDF combinations factored out; experimental and PDF
uncertainties are propagated with Monte Carlo replicas. Stage II reconstructs
s(x, k; Q) with an end-to-end differentiable k quadrature layer. Applied to
Fermilab cross-section data from experiments E288 and E605, the method
reproduces the measured qT spectra across Q and yields x and Q dependent TMDs
that broaden with Q, with uncertainty bands that consistently propagate
experimental, PDF, algorithmic and methodological components. The approach is
minimally biased (no factorized Ansatze and no bT transform) and provides a
transferable template for polarized TMDs and related QCD inverse problems.

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the charmed-strange molecular
tetraquarks composed of a $K^{(*)}$ meson and a $T$-doublet (anti-)charmed
meson. Our analysis is performed within the one-boson-exchange model, with a
careful treatment of $S$-$D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. We
identify the $X_1(2900)$ resonance, observed by LHCb, as a molecular state in
the coupled $K \bar{D}_1 / K^* \bar{D}_1 / K^* \bar{D}_2^*$ system with quantum
numbers $I(J^P)=0(1^-)$. This state is dominated by the $K \bar{D}_1$ component
but exhibits a significant admixture from the $K^* \bar{D}_1$ channel.
Furthermore, we predict several partner states of the $X_1(2900)$ in the
$K^*\bar{D}_1$ and $K^{(*)}\bar{D}_2^*$ systems. We also extend our framework
to the $K^{(*)} {D}_1/K^{(*)} {D}_2^*$ systems, where our results suggest a
series of $T_{c \bar s}$-type charmed-strange molecular tetraquark candidates.
These findings provide a comprehensive picture of the molecular spectrum in the
charmed-strange sector and can be tested in future experimental studies.

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological phase transition dynamics in a supersymmetric
left-right symmetric model based on the gauge group $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L
\times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ that addresses the strong CP problem through
extended parity symmetry and doublet-doublet splitting. We compute the finite
temperature effective potential including one-loop Coleman-Weinberg
corrections, thermal contributions, and daisy resummation to determine whether
the $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L} \to U(1)_Y$ symmetry breaking transition can
produce observable gravitational waves. For phenomenologically viable
parameters satisfying current LHC constraints, we find that the phase
transition is strongly first-order with nucleation temperature $T_n \sim 0.5
v_R$, transition strength parameter $\alpha \sim 0.01-0.3$, and inverse
duration $\beta/H \sim 100$. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave
background peaks at frequencies $f \sim 0.1-1$ Hz with amplitude
$h^2\Omega_{GW} \sim 10^{-14}-10^{-12}$. We find that there is a parameter
region where the gravitational wave spectrum overlaps with DECIGO/BBO
sensitivity curves, providing a potentially observable signature connecting the
theoretical solution to the strong CP problem with gravitational wave
experiments.

### [24] [A radiative seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17292)
*Shilpa Jangid,Hiroshi Okada*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-loop neutrino mass model that links fermionic and bosonic dark matter (DM) candidates with neutrinos. The fermionic DM is favored as its mass is generated at the one-loop level due to a $Z_3$ gauging TY non-invertible fusion rule combined with a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry. The model ensures DM stability via a remnant $Z_2$ symmetry, suppresses interactions between SM particles and heavy fermions/ bosons, and provides predictions for lepton parameters, LFVs, muon $g-2$, and DM relic density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simultaneously address neutrino masses, dark matter stability, and lepton sector predictions while avoiding tree-level DM masses and reducing free parameters through symmetry constraints.

Method: Introduces a $Z_3$ gauging TY non-invertible fusion rule and non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry. Fermionic DM mass is generated at one-loop level, neutrino masses at one-loop level with residual $Z_2$ symmetry. Performs χ² analysis for lepton parameters and calculates observables like LFVs and relic density.

Result: Predictions for NH/IH neutrino mass spectra, lepton mixing angles/CP phases, muon $g-2$, lepton flavor violation rates, and DM relic density consistent with observations. The model successfully suppresses unwanted interactions and minimizes free parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively unifies neutrino mass generation and dark matter physics through symmetry constraints, providing testable predictions for particle physics experiments and observations.

Abstract: We propose a two-loop neutrino mass model where fermionic and bosonic dark
matter (DM) candidates are simultaneously connected to the neutrinos. But the
fermionic DM candidate is favored compared to the bosonic one due to generating
the fermionic DM mass at one-loop level. In order to obtain our desired
Lagrangian and Higgs potential, we introduce a $Z_3$ gauging TY non-invertible
fusion rule with the assistance of a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry.
The fusion rule forbids the mass of DM candidate at tree level but its mass is
generated at one-loop level where the DM mass term dynamically violates the
fusion rule. After that, the neutrino mass matrix is induced at one-loop level
where a remnant $Z_2$ symmetry is still remained. The symmetry assures the
stability of our DM candidate. The non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry plays
a role in forbidding the interactions between the SM particles and heavier
fermions $X_R$ and an isospin singlet inert scalar boson $S_0$ that run in the
DM mass loop, in addition to reduction our free parameters that leads to our
predictions for lepton sector. We perform $\chi^2$ numerical analysis for the
lepton masses, mixing angles, and phases, and we show several predictions for
NH and IH. Then, we demonstrate our lepton flavor violations, muon anomalous
magnetic dipole moment, and the relic density of the DM candidate fixing the
best fit point of the lepton sector.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the form factors W_+(s) and W_S(s) for radiative K→πℓ^+ℓ^- decays using dispersive representations with minimal free parameters, constrained by analyticity and unitarity. It leverages Khuri-Treiman solutions for K→3π amplitudes and determines the sign of W_+, enabling extraction of the ΔI=1/2 component of K_S→πππ amplitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To precisely determine the form factors involved in radiative kaon decays and address ambiguities in their signs and energy dependence, employing theoretical frameworks like dispersive analysis and Khuri-Treiman equations.

Method: Constructs dispersive representations for W_+ and W_S based on asymptotic behaviors and physical constraints, using Khuri-Treiman solutions for K→3π to extrapolate to higher energies. Analyzes experimental |W_+|^2 data to fix the sign of W_+.

Result: Experimental |W_+|^2 is well-reproduced, sign of W_+ is unambiguously determined, and ΔI=1/2 K_S→πππ amplitude is linked to W_+(0)+W_S(0). Discussion on using |W_S|^2 data to fix W_S(0)'s sign.

Conclusion: The approach successfully constrains form factors using dispersive methods and K→3π amplitudes, offering a pathway to resolve both modulus and phase information crucial for precision tests of the Standard Model and beyond.

Abstract: We reconsider the constraints on the form factors $W_+ (s)$ and $W_S (s)$,
describing the radiative decay modes $K^+\to\pi^+ \ell^+\ell^-$ and
$K_S\to\pi^0 \ell^+\ell^-$, associated with the general properties of
analyticity and unitarity. Starting from the simple consideration of the
asymptotic behaviours of the two combinations $2 W_+ (s) - W_S (s)$ and $W_+
(s) + W_S (s)$, we derive a minimal pair of dispersive representations which
involves only two free parameters. An important input for these representations
consists of the $K\to3\pi$ decay amplitudes, for which we use a set of
solutions of the Khuri-Treiman equations obtained recently. These solutions
provide an extrapolation from the physical $K\to3\pi$ decay region up to the
resonant $K\pi\to\pi\pi$ scattering regions. We show that the experimental
energy dependence of $|W_+|^2$ can be well reproduced and that the sign of
$W_+$ is unambiguously determined. We also show that the yet unknown
$\Delta{I}=1/2$ part of the $K_S\to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$ amplitude can be
determined from the value of $W_+(0) + W_S(0)$. The possibility of fixing the
sign of $W_S(0)$ using experimental data on both $|W_+|^2$ and $|W_S|^2$ is
discussed.

Abstract: Although the axion is the most compelling solution to the strong CP problem,

axion, leading to a distinct and testable parameter space. Remarkably, this
minimal framework simultaneously accounts for neutrino masses, baryon
asymmetry, and dark matter.

Abstract: We present a complete one-loop analysis of charged scalar boson pair
production in photon-photon collisions, $\gamma\gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$, within
the framework of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). The calculation is carried out
in the on-shell renormalization scheme and incorporates both weak corrections
and QED effects, including soft and hard photon radiation. Virtual loop
contributions and real emission processes are computed using the Feynman
diagrammatic method, ensuring the cancellation of ultraviolet and infrared
divergences. To properly account for the Coulomb singularity that arises in the
QED sector near threshold, we introduce the resummed cross section based on the
Sommerfeld factor. The IDM parameter space is explored under theoretical
consistency conditions, collider limits, and dark matter constraints, and three
representative scenarios are studied in detail. We find that the magnitude of
the quantum corrections is strongly controlled by the absolute value of the
trilinear scalar coupling $\lambda_{h^0 H^+ H^-}$, which correlates with the
charged scalar mass. When all constraints are applied, the weak corrections are
typically in the range of $-12\%$ to $-7\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=250$~GeV, and between
$-15\%$ and $6\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=500$~GeV. At higher energies, such as
$\sqrt{s}=1$~TeV, the corrections can become very large, ranging from about
$-20\%$ up to $+60\%$. Our findings highlight the significant role of
higher-order effects in photon-photon collisions and establish $\gamma\gamma
\to H^\pm H^\mp$ as a promising process to investigate the charged scalar
sector of the IDM at future high-energy photon colliders. Several benchmark
points are proposed to facilitate future experimental searches.

Abstract: We present precise results for the inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in
gluon-gluon fusion at the LHC considering state-of-the-art fourth-order results
in perturbative QCD arising from the dominant soft and virtual gluon emissions.
Utilizing four-loop QCD results for the gluon-form factor, the splitting
function and related anomalous dimensions, we study the effects of threshold
enhanced soft gluon emissions and estimate their impact on the total
cross-section at the fourth order. Our study highlights the role of these
higher-order contributions in improving the perturbative convergence and in
significantly reducing the renormalization and factorization scale
uncertainties. The results provide strong evidence for the perturbative
stability and reliability of Higgs boson cross-section predictions at the LHC,
thereby reinforcing the robustness of theoretical inputs in precision Higgs
phenomenology. We also provide cross-section predictions using a large set of
available parton distribution functions and show that, together with the value
of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(m_Z)$, they cause the largest residual
uncertainty for the Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion.

TL;DR: The paper calculates electromagnetic moments of molecular states to understand the internal structure of charmed and bottom states, finding light quarks dominate and distinct charge distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively compute electromagnetic moments for $D^* K$, $DK^*$, $B^* K$, and $BK^*$ molecular states, providing benchmarks for lattice calculations and experimental tests.

Method: Used QCD light-cone sum rules with molecular-type interpolating currents, along with flavor decomposition to analyze charge and spin distributions.

Result: Light quarks dominate electromagnetic response; $D^*K$ and $B^*K$ are oblate with negative quadrupole moments, while $DK^*$ and $BK^*$ are prolate with positive moments, influenced by strange quarks.

Conclusion: Results offer insights into the structure of axial-vector states and guide future experimental and theoretical studies via radiative transitions and production observables.

Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the axial-vector molecular
states $D^* K$, $DK^*$, $B^* K$, and $BK^*$, which are used to model the
charmed states $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom
partners with quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$. To our knowledge, this presents the
first comprehensive calculation of the magnetic and quadrupole moments for
these specific molecular configurations. Employing the QCD light-cone sum rule
method with molecular-type interpolating currents, we compute these moments and
perform a detailed flavor decomposition to reveal the internal distribution of
the electromagnetic charge and spin. Our results demonstrate that the light up
and down quarks dominate the electromagnetic response, with negligible
contributions from the heavy quarks. The $D^* K$ and $B^* K$ states exhibit
negative quadrupole moments and slightly oblate charge distributions, whereas
the $DK^*$ and $BK^*$ states possess positive quadrupole moments and prolate
distributions, with significant contributions from the strange quark. The
predicted moments provide benchmarks for lattice QCD calculations and are
testable through their influence on radiative transitions and photo- and
electro-production observables at high-luminosity facilities, offering crucial
insights into the internal structure and nature of these axial-vector states.

Abstract: The observation of collectivity in collisions of small systems has
constituted a challenge for the heavy-ion community for over a decade now. The
absence of jet quenching in those systems presents an apparent contradiction to
the presence of an azimuthal anisotropy of high-$p_\perp$ particles. In the
present work, we investigate the role of colour coherence in this puzzle. For
that, we use the \textsc{Jewel} Monte Carlo model in its latest version, which
includes effects of colour coherence in the jet-medium interactions. We then
compare the two scenarios, with and without colour coherence, and quantify the
effect on hadron and jet $R_{AA}$ as well as on high-$p_\perp$ $v_2$. The
results indicate that, although coherence effects do account for an increase in
$R_{AA}$, they do not affect $v_2$ to the same extent. Using hydrodynamic
profiles generated with \textit{Trajectum} we compare O+O and Pb+Pb collisions
at the same charged particle multiplicity and find that the nuclear
modification factors are the same in both systems despite their different
shapes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a first-row correlation in the lepton flavor mixing matrix U's first row elements, suggesting |Ue1|² equals twice the sum of |Ue2|² and |Ue3|², even under non-unitary conditions in the canonical seesaw mechanism. This aligns with TM1 pattern predictions for mixing angles and will be tested by JUNO and Daya Bay data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore correlations in lepton mixing parameters under non-unitary conditions and validate the TM1 flavor mixing pattern's predictions through upcoming experimental data.

Method: The authors derive the first-row correlation equation based on non-unitary U matrix properties in the canonical seesaw model, then cross-check with TM1 pattern angle predictions (sin²θ12 = (1 - 2 tan²θ13)/3).

Result: The proposed correlation aligns with TM1-derived mixing angles and is testable by combining JUNO (precision reactor neutrino oscillation) and Daya Bay (Precision antineutrino measurement) experimental results.

Conclusion: The first-row correlation provides a novel constraint for non-unitary lepton mixing studies, offering a critical benchmark for future neutrino experiments to validate theoretical flavor models.

Abstract: We conjecture that there exists a remarkable correlation among the three
elements in the first row of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$:
$|U^{}_{e1}|^2 = 2 \left(|U^{}_{e2}|^2 + |U^{}_{e3}|^2\right)$, which holds
even though $U$ is non-unitary in the canonical seesaw mechanism. This
``first-row correlation" is fully consistent with $\sin^2\theta^{}_{12} =
\left(1 - 2\tan^2\theta^{}_{13}\right)/3$ for the two active neutrino mixing
angles derived from the TM1 flavor mixing pattern, and it will be {\it
directly} tested by the upcoming JUNO precision data combined with the Daya Bay
precision measurement.

Abstract: This work explores exotic signatures from confining dark sectors that may
arise in the e+e- collision mode at the Future Circular Collider. Assuming the
Higgs boson mediates the interaction between the Standard Model and the dark
sector, dark quarks can be produced in e+e- collisions. The ensuing strong
dynamics may lead to semi-visible jet final states, containing both visible and
invisible particles. We investigate semi-visible jets with different fractions
of invisible states, and enriched in leptons and photons. When the invisible
component is large, selections based on kinematic features, such as the missing
energy in the event, already provide good signal-to-background discrimination.
For smaller invisible fractions, the reduced missing energy makes these signals
more similar to Standard Model events, and we therefore employ a graph neural
network jet tagger exploiting differences in jet substructure. This machine
learning strategy improves sensitivity and enhances the discovery prospects of
Higgs boson-induced semi-visible jets at the Future Circular Collider. Our
results show that the proposed strategy can effectively probe a wide parameter
space for the models considered, and a variety of signatures, constraining the
Higgs boson exotic branching ratios into dark quarks at the permille-level.

\textsc{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}. The method assembles helicity amplitudes into
event-by-event production matrices. These are written to the LHE file in a
compact form, together with run metadata, enabling direct post-processing of
quantum observables. The implementation supports bi- and multipartite qubit and
qutrit final states, configurable reference frames, and both polarised and
unpolarised initial states. A companion, easy-to-extend library provides
analysis routines to determine key quantum-information measures and witnesses.
These include purity, concurrence, and entanglement of formation for qubits;
Peres--Horodecki tests and negativity; spin-polarisation vectors and
correlation matrices; $D$-coefficients; and stabiliser-based ``magic''
measures. As a result, multi-particle quantum correlations can be quantified
systematically. We validate the implementation against known results for $t\bar
t$ and $VV$ ($V=W^\pm,Z$) production in $pp$ and $e^+e^-$ collisions and in
heavy-resonance decays. We then consider new applications and study quantum
correlations in several LHC final states: $t\bar t W^\pm$, $tW^-$ vs.\ $t(\bar
t\to W^- \bar b)$, and $t\bar t t$ vs. $t\bar t t\bar t$.

### [34] [B-Meson Anomalies: Effective Field Theory Meets Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17742)
*Alejandro Mir,Jorge Alda,Siannah Penaranda*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores potential new physics in B-meson decays by analyzing discrepancies between experimental data and Standard Model predictions using an effective field theory framework with non-universal quark generation mixing. A machine learning-enhanced global fit identifies best-fit mixing between second and third quark generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experimental measurements in B-meson decays (e.g., R_{D^{(*)}}, R_{J/ψ}, B→K⁺νν̄) show deviations from Standard Model predictions, suggesting possible new physics. The study aims to explore these NP effects through effective field theory with generation-dependent interactions.

Method: Used effective field theory assuming NP affects only one quark generation in the interaction basis. Analyzed three mixing scenarios via global fits with ML-based Monte Carlo to handle non-Gaussian parameter distributions, considering singlet/triplet four-fermion operators.

Result: Best fit scenario involves mixing between second and third quark generations without lepton mixing. Non-Gaussian parameter distributions required ML methods for accurate sampling. NP effects are significant in quark sectors but not leptonic.

Conclusion: Observed discrepancies hint at NP in quark sector mixing, particularly between generations 2-3. Machine learning methods are crucial for accurately modeling complex distribution shapes in high-energy physics analyses.

Abstract: Discrepancies between experimental measurements and Standard Model
predictions in $B$-meson decays, especially in lepton flavor universality
ratios like $R_{D^{(*)}}$, $R_{J/\psi}$ and branching ratios for processes like
$B\to K^+\nu\bar\nu$, suggest possible new physics (NP). In this study, we use
an effective field theory framework, assuming NP effects only affect a single
generation in the interaction basis, leading to non-universal mixing when
rotating to the mass basis. We perform a global fit to the current experimental
data, exploring three scenarios characterized by different mixing patterns and
constraints. Our analysis finds that the best fit involves mixing between the
second and third quark generations, with no lepton sector mixing and
independent coefficients for singlet and triplet four-fermion operators. To
accurately capture the non-Gaussian nature of the resulting parameter
distributions, we use a Machine Learning-based Monte Carlo algorithm, enabling
the generation of representative samples that reflect the true underlying
distributions. This work highlights the valuable role of Machine Learning in
accurately modeling complex parameter distributions in particle physics
analyses.

TL;DR: The paper calculates higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections to top-antitop quark pair and Z boson associated production in proton collisions. It finds soft-gluon corrections dominate, presents approximate NNLO and N³LO cross sections with NLO EW corrections, and compares to LHC measurements while analyzing differential distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision in theoretical predictions for tt̄Z production by including higher-order corrections, better aligning with experimental data from the LHC, and to provide detailed differential distributions for further analysis.

Method: Computed next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N³LO) QCD corrections coupled with next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak corrections. Used soft-gluon contributions enhanced approximate cross sections based on exact NLO QCD results. Compared with LHC experimental data.

Result: Soft-gluon contributions are numerically dominant. The aNNLO and aN³LO cross sections with NLO EW corrections reduce theoretical uncertainties. Agreement between theoretical results and LHC measurements is observed, with top-quark pT and rapidity distributions showing distinctive kinematic features.

Conclusion: Including higher-order QCD and EW corrections significantly improves tt̄Z production predictions. Enhanced cross sections and differential distributions provide valuable tools for LHC precision tests and new physics discovery.

Abstract: We present calculations of higher-order QCD and electroweak (EW) corrections
to the associated production of a top-antitop quark pair and a $Z$ boson, i.e.
$t{\bar t}Z$ production, in proton collisions. We find that the contributions
from soft-gluon corrections are numerically dominant and large. We present
approximate NNLO (aNNLO) and approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) cross sections that
include soft corrections on top of the exact NLO QCD result. We also add
electroweak corrections through NLO. We compare our aN$^3$LO QCD + NLO EW
theoretical results to measurements of total cross sections from the LHC, and
we also calculate top-quark differential distributions in transverse momentum
and rapidity.

Abstract: Early X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) traces the transition between
the prompt emission and the afterglow radiation, and its rapid flux decline is
often interpreted as the tail of the prompt emission. As such, it can offer
insights into the emission mechanisms active during the prompt emission and the
physics of GRB jets. In this work, we focus on merger-driven GRBs, which are
sources of gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by ground-based
interferometers, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We present a systematic
analysis of the early X-ray emission ($t < 10^3 \ \mathrm{s}$) of a sample of
16 merger-driven GRB candidates detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
(hereafter, Swift). We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of soft and
hard X-ray data (0.3-150 keV) by fitting two curved spectral models to the
spectra: a physical synchrotron model and an empirical smoothly broken power
law model. We characterized the evolution of the peak energy and bolometric
flux, and derived the intrinsic properties of the 10 bursts with measured
redshift. We discovered a tight correlation between the rest-frame peak energy
of the spectra and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity. Specifically, we
obtained $\nu_{c,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.64 \pm 0.03)}$ when adopting the
synchrotron model, and $E_{p,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.58 \pm 0.04)}$ when
adopting the smoothly broken power law. Both relations were extrapolated to the
typical prompt emission energies and well describe the properties of short GRBs
detected in the MeV gamma-rays. These results suggest a common origin for the
prompt and steep-decay emissions in merger-driven GRBs, and rule out
high-latitude emission as the dominant process shaping the early X-ray tails.
Finally, we assessed the detectability of these sources with the Wide-field
X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe mission.

Abstract: 3C 84 is the brightest cluster galaxy in the Perseus Cluster. It is among the
closest radio-loud active galaxies and among the very few that can be detected
from low frequency radio up to TeV $\gamma$-rays. Here we report on the first
X-ray polarization observation of 3C~84 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer, for a total of 2.2 Msec that coincides with a flare in $\gamma$-rays.
This is the longest observation for a radio-loud active galaxy that allowed us
to reach unprecedented sensitivity, leading to the detection of an X-ray
polarization degree of $\rm\Pi_X=4.2\pm1.3\%$ ($\sim3.2\sigma$ confidence) at
an X-ray electric vector polarization angle of $\rm
\psi_X=163^{\circ}\pm9^{\circ}$, that is aligned with the radio jet direction
on the sky. Optical polarization observations show fast variability about the
jet axis as well. Our results strongly favor models in which X-rays are
produced by Compton scattering from relativistic electrons -- specifically
Synchrotron Self-Compton -- that takes places downstream, away from the
supermassive black hole.

### [38] [GRB 230307A Formed No Dust or Was Not a Binary Neutron Star Merger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16121)
*Prasiddha Arunachalam,Phillip Macias,Ryan. J. Foley*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of JWST infrared spectra of GRB 230307A challenges the r-process-powered kilonova origin by showing inconsistencies between required dust composition/mass and merger yields, and proposes alternative explanations for the observed infrared continuum and emission lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the infrared properties of GRB 230307A align with predictions of an r-process-powered kilonova, particularly addressing discrepancies like the late-time blackbody spectrum and the origin of the [Te III] emission line.

Method: Modeling thermal emission from potential dust compositions (carbon, silicates, iron) to match observed infrared continua; comparing dust mass requirements with merger yields; constraining Ni-56 mass from luminosity limits; assessing compatibility of KN models with simultaneous dust and r-process element production.

Result: Carbon/silicate dust masses exceed merger expectations; iron dust is marginally consistent but unlikely to form; Ni-56 mass is constrained low; no KN model explains both continuum and [Te III] line satisfactorily.

Conclusion: The blackbody continuum likely not from dust associated with a kilonova, implying GRB 230307A may not stem from a binary compact-object merger or another mechanism解释 the observations differently.

Abstract: We present a new analysis of the JWST infrared spectra of GRB 230307A (AT
2023vfi), a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with an infrared excess and spectral
lines suggestive of significant heavy $r$-process production. The spectra,
taken 29 and 61~days after the GRB trigger, have blackbody-like continua with
$T_{\rm eff} \approx 550$ K and an emission line near $2.1$ $\mu$m, previously
attributed to [Te III]. This line identification has been used as evidence for
an $r$-process-powered kilonova (KN), despite no KN model producing a
blackbody-like spectrum at late times. Such an infrared continuum could be
emitted by newly formed dust, and we model the thermal emission to infer dust
properties, including composition and mass. We find that the emission requires
at least 3--$6 \times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ of carbon or silicate dust, which is
inconsistent with $r$-process yields expected from a neutron star merger.
Alternatively, the continuum could be from $2\times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ of
metallic iron dust, which is mildly consistent (at 3$\sigma$) with KN models,
but such dust is unlikely to form in the expanding ejecta. GRB 230307A's low
late-time luminosity also constrains the amount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni
produced to $<2.6 \times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ (3$\sigma$). No KN model can
simultaneously form the necessary dust for the infrared continuum and heavy
elements for the [Te III] line. We conclude that the blackbody continuum is not
due to dust emission, or GRB 230307A did not originate from a binary
compact-object merger.

Abstract: We present a study of the minute-timescale optical variability and
spectroscopic outflow signatures in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070
during its 2018 outburst and re-brightenings. Minute-cadence, multi-filter
optical light curves were obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network and
the Al Sadeem Observatory (UAE) over 2018-2020, complemented by X-ray data from
Swift/BAT, XRT, and MAXI. We also acquired contemporaneous low-resolution
optical spectra with the 2.1 m OAN San Pedro Martir and OAGH Cananea telescopes
(Mexico) and the 1.5 m G.D. Cassini telescope at Loiano (Italy). The optical
fractional rms peaks in the hard state and is dominated by short-timescale
flickering that strengthens toward longer wavelengths, suggesting that the
variability is jet-driven. In this scenario, inflow fluctuations inject
velocity perturbations at the jet base (internal shock model). The variability
is quenched in the soft state, with any residual signal likely linked to
accretion-flow fluctuations. This behaviour supports the accretion-ejection
coupling in black hole binaries and shows that the jet's variability signature
extends to optical wavelengths in all hard states. In the faintest hard states,
residual optical variability may instead trace cyclo-synchrotron emission from
the hot flow. The spectra show double-peaked emission lines and tentative
cold-wind signatures during the hard state. Such winds were reported during the
main 2018 outburst; here we find evidence of their presence also in later
re-brightenings. Their absence in the soft state likely reflects stronger disc
ionisation from the higher X-ray flux, suppressing low-ionisation optical
features.

TL;DR: The paper explores the detection of exotrojans (extrasolar Trojan asteroids) around pulsars using radio timing data. Weak signals suggesting Jupiter-mass exotrojans were found in two pulsar systems, though these are likely from other sources. An upper mass limit of ~8 Jupiter masses was set for another system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exotrojans are predicted in extrasolar systems but remain unconfirmed. Pulsars with low-mass companions offer a unique opportunity to detect them through precise timing.

Method: Analyzing NANOGrav pulsar data using techniques for detecting reflex motion from Trojan libration. Cross-checking optical and radio timing data for inconsistencies to set mass limits.

Result: Weak signals consistent with ~1 Jupiter mass exotrojans in PSR J0023+0923 and PSR J1705-1903 systems, but likely not genuine. A strict upper limit of ~8 Jupiter masses for PSR 1641+8049.

Conclusion: While current evidence isn't conclusive, the methods demonstrate potential for future exotrojan detection around pulsars using combined radio/optical observations.

Abstract: Trojan asteroids are found in the equilateral triangle Lagrange points of the
Sun-Jupiter system in great number, though they also exist less prolifically in
other Sun-planet systems. Despite up to planetary mass Trojans being predicted
in extrasolar systems (i.e. exotrojans), they remain largely unconfirmed,
though with recent strong candidate evidence emerging. We turn the current
search for exotrojans to radio pulsars with low-mass companions
($\sim0.01\,\rm{M}_\odot$) using accurately measured pulse times of arrival.
With techniques developed for detecting the reflex motion of a star due to a
librating Trojan, we place reasonable mass constraints ($\sim
1\,\rm{M}_\oplus$) on potential exotrojans around binary pulsars observed in
the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We find weak evidence consistent with
$\sim1\,\rm{M}_{\rm J}$ exotrojans in the PSR~J0023+0923 and PSR~J1705$-$1903
systems, though the signals likely have a different, unknown source. We also
place a libration-independent upper mass constraint of $\sim8$\,M$_{\rm J}$ on
exotrojans in the PSR~1641+8049 binary system by looking for an inconsistency
between the times of superior conjunction as measured by optical light curves
and those predicted by radio timing.

### [41] [Charged pion chain decay and the cosmic ray positron flux](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16170)
*Paolo Lipari*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper identifies an error in the calculation of the positron flux contribution from pion decays, present in a 1997 study by Moskalenko and Strong, and evaluates its impact on subsequent cosmic ray analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to correct the misconception in the positron flux background calculations, enabling accurate discrimination between standard astrophysical sources and potential new physics like dark matter or pulsars.

Method: The authors revisit the pion decay positron spectrum derivation, identify the spectral shape error in the 1997 work, and quantify its effect on flux predictions through comparative calculations.

Result: The analysis shows that the error leads to underestimation of the positron flux at higher energies, altering conclusions about possible exotic contributions.

Conclusion: Correcting this error is crucial for precise modeling of cosmic ray positron spectra, ensuring reliable interpretation of AMS-02 and other experiments' data regarding dark matter or pulsar signals.

Abstract: The study of the cosmic ray positron flux has attracted intense attention in
recent years, especially because the observations suggest that it could receive
contributions from sources such as pulsars or the self--annihilation or decay
of dark matter particles. The main known source of relativistic positrons, that
form the background to possible additional contributions, is the chain decay of
$\pi^+$ produced in the inelastic interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar
and circumstellar gas. The shape of the energy spectrum of positrons produced
in these pion decays can be calculated exactly and is well known. However,
surprisingly, some estimates of the contribution of the standard mechanism to
the positron flux have adopted an incorrect spectral shape of the positron
produced in these decays, following an error present in a 1997 paper of
Moskalenko and Strong. In this work we report this error, discuss its origin,
and estimate its impact on the numerical results.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores how variations in the symmetry energy from covariant density functional theory affect properties of hot, isentropic compact stars (neutron stars) in both static and maximally rotating states. Key findings include the persistence of universal relations between stellar properties across different equations of state and conditions representative of binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of symmetry energy variations on compact star properties under extreme astrophysical conditions, such as those found in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars.

Method: The authors model static and maximally rotating configurations using nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes. They fix entropy per baryon (s/k_B=1 and 3) and electron fractions (Y_e=0.1 and 0.4), then compute mass-radius relations, moment-of-inertia-mass relations, and Keplerian frequency dependencies.

Result: Key results include maintained universal relations between global stellar properties across different equations of state and conditions, as well as insights into how symmetry energy variations influence compact star dynamics and stability.

Conclusion: The study confirms that fundamental universal relations persist despite varying symmetry energy parameters and matter compositions, providing robust constraints for astrophysical models of neutron star mergers and post-supernova environments.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting
cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how
variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from
covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both
nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy
slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions
$Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star
mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and
moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian
(mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic
to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations
between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic
equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and
Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron
fraction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present bolometric corrections, as a function of wavelength, for powerful
radio-loud quasars from the Revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Galaxies
(3CRR) at 1 < z < 2. The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the
intrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range
1{\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over
inclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use
accretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the
unobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV
gap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range (~1-400)
across different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray
luminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of
these intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is
divided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly
different values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher
Eddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity
and accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes
roughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact
jets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This
suggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio
luminosity in the younger jets. Our results provide physically motivated
bolometric corrections for powerful radio quasars that are applicable to
powerful radio-loud quasars at any epoch.

TL;DR: The study analyzes 6.7 GHz methanol monitoring data over ten years in G9.62+0.20E, identifying new periodicities and unifying observations with a Maxwell-Bloch model under superradiance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex flare behaviors and periodicities in methanol masers, and to test the applicability of a unified physical framework (Maxwell-Bloch) for explaining diverse flaring phenomena in G9.62+0.20E.

Method: Analysis of a decade-long dataset (6.7 GHz methanol maser emission) using time-series analysis to detect periodicities. Model fitting using a Maxwell-Bloch framework under superradiance conditions, incorporating parameters like temperature and collisional timescales.

Result: Confirmed existing periods (241.3d and 52.5d) and discovered three new periods (127.0d, 163.9d, 204.1d). Found that some periods span multiple velocity channels while others are restricted to single components. Model successfully reproduces all flares with consistent physical parameters, indicating uniform conditions in the maser region.

Conclusion: The observed multi-periodic flaring in G9.62+0.20E is explained by a unified Maxwell-Bloch model under superradiant superradiance, suggesting this mechanism is fundamental to maser flaring phenomena in similar astrophysical environments.

Abstract: We analyze a decade of 6.7 GHz methanol monitoring data in G9.62+0.20E,
confirming the known periodicities of p1 = 241.3 +/- 2.3 d and p2 = 52.5 +/-
0.3 d, and identifying three new cycles at p3 = 127.0 +/- 1.6 d, p4 = 163.9 +/-
2.9 d, and p5 = 204.1 +/- 1.5 d. The 241.3-d and 204.1-d periods occur in
multiple velocity channels, while the others are confined to single components.
Despite their diverse morphologies and timescales, all flares can be reproduced
within a unified Maxwell-Bloch framework operating in the fast-transient
superradiance regime, driven by narrow periodic pump excitations. Model fits
yield consistent environmental parameters across periodicities (temperatures,
collisional timescales), pointing to broadly uniform physical conditions in the
masing region. The discovery of new periodicities and their unified
Maxwell-Bloch modeling provide a consistent picture of multi-periodic flaring
in G9.62+0.20E and support superradiance as a general framework for maser
flaring.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study determines a higher than previously thought metallicity threshold (0.6 times solar) for the formation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) using host galaxy data and a model that incorporates astrophysical scatters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the debate around the metallicity threshold for LGRB formation and test whether a sharp cutoff exists. Previous studies suggested lower thresholds (~0.3 solar), but observational evidence was inconclusive.

Method: Developed a model linking cosmic star formation history with galaxy metallicity and stellar mass. Incorporated scatters in mass-metallicity relations and metallicity distribution within galaxies. Varied metallicity threshold and shape (abrupt vs. gradual) to fit observed LGRB host galaxy properties.

Result: A sharp cutoff at Z_O/H = 8.6 (0.6 solar metallicity) best matches observations. Lower thresholds (Z_O/H=8.3) underpredict observed LGRBs. Scatters in astrophysical relations were critical in achieving model consistency.

Conclusion: The metallicity threshold for LGRBs is higher than most theoretical predictions (~near-solar), challenging prior models suggesting lower metallicity requirements. Observations favor a strict cutoff rather than a gradual decline in GRB efficiency with increasing metallicity.

Abstract: Both theoretical models and observations of collapsar created gamma-ray
bursts -- typically long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) -- suggest that
these transients cannot occur at high metallicity, likely due to angular
momentum losses via stellar winds for potential progenitor stars. However, the
precise metallicity threshold (if it is a hard threshold) above which the
formation of LGRBs is suppressed is still a topic of discussion. We
investigated observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies to
constrain this metallicity dependence. In order to compute LGRB rates we
modelled the cosmic history of star formation, as a function of host galaxy
metallicity and stellar mass, and added a LGRB efficiency function that can
include various shapes including abrupt cutoffs and more gradual variations in
the GRB yield with metallicity. In contrast to previous work, this model
includes scatters in the relations between mass, metallicity, and star
formation rate, as well as a scatter in the metallicity distribution inside
galaxies. We then varied both the threshold value and shape, and compared it to
observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies. In our model a sharp
cutoff at an oxygen abundance $Z_{\text{O/H}}=12+\log(\text{O/H})=8.6\pm0.1$
(corresponding to $\sim0.6Z_{\odot}$) provides the best explanation for the
observed LGRB data. In contrast, a lower threshold proposed in literature (i.e.
at $Z_{\text{O/H}}=8.3$ or $\sim0.3Z_{\odot}$) fits observations poorly. We
therefore conclude that, in contrast to most theoretical LGRB models, a
relatively high metallicity threshold at near-solar values provides the best
match between our model and observed LGRBs.

### [46] [A Practical Framework for Estimating the Repetition Likelihood of Fast Radio Bursts from Spectral Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16338)
*Wan-Peng Sun,Yong-Kun Zhang,Ji-Guo Zhang,Xiaohui Liu,Yichao Li,Fu-Wen Zhang,Wan-Ting Hou,Jing-Fei Zhang,Xin Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study proposes a classification framework using spectral morphology parameters (spectral running r and spectral index γ) to distinguish repeating and non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) in CHIME/FRB data. Repeater FRBs show steeper, narrower spectra, while non-repeaters have flatter, broader spectra. An empirical probability map and Gaussian Mixture Model identify high-probability repeaters for further study, offering insights into FRB origins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurately classifying FRBs as repeaters or non-repeaters by developing an interpretable framework based on spectral features, which can help in understanding their underlying physical origins.

Method: The method involves dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis to identify critical spectral parameters (r and γ). An empirical probability map and Gaussian Mixture Model are used to assess repetition likelihood and identify priority targets for monitoring.

Result: Key findings include distinct spectral characteristics separating repeaters (steeper/narrower spectra) and non-repeaters (flatter/broader spectra), with an empirical probability gradient from ~65% to ~5% repetition likelihood across regions in the γ-r space. Several high-probability repeaters were identified among apparent non-repeaters.

Conclusion: The framework provides a simple, generalizable tool for FRB classification and underscores the importance of spectral morphology in uncovering FRB origins, suggesting prioritized monitoring of identified candidates and future applications to expanding datasets.

Abstract: The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue
to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters
from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here
we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable
classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality
reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the
spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical
parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the
CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy
regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in
flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We
further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space,
showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the
high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining
this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several
apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending
them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a
simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB
sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling
FRB origins.

*Bibhuti Bhusan Dutta,Liza Devi,Biplob Sarkar,Asish Jyoti Boruah*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper reviews the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) in accretion discs around black holes, focusing on its role in generating vortices for angular momentum transport and potential links to observed QPOs. It covers 3D relativistic simulations, extensions to磁 fields and self-gravity, and observational implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind angular momentum transport and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accretion discs around black holes where magnetic effects are weak. RWI provides a viable explanation through vortensity profile extrema-driven instabilities.

Method: Review of theoretical concepts of RWI, analysis of 3D and relativistic simulations, extension of models to include magnetic fields and self-gravity, and discussion of observational connections.

Result: RWI generates large-scale vortices that enhance angular momentum transport and may explain QPOs in X-ray binaries. Simulations and extended models highlight RWI's robustness and relevance across different astrophysical conditions.

Conclusion: RWI is a critical instability in HD accretion disc dynamics, especially in weakly magnetized systems. Future observational studies could validate its predicted effects, such as QPO generation, and models incorporating magnetic fields/self-gravity improve realism for diverse astrophysical scenarios.

Abstract: The Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) has become an important concept in
understanding the hydrodynamics (HDs) of accretion discs (ADs), especially in
systems around black holes (BHs) where magnetic effects are either weak or
absent. This instability is triggered by extrema (or sharp gradients) in the
vortensity profile of the disc. Once activated, it leads to non-axisymmetric
disturbances that can grow into large-scale vortices. These vortices play a
significant role in the outward transport of angular momentum (AM). They may
also help explain the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed
in certain astrophysical systems such as X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we review
the main theoretical ideas behind RWI, as well as findings from more advanced
three-dimensional (3D) and relativistic simulations. We also mention how the
theory has been extended to include magnetic fields and self-gravity(SG) and
what these results might imply for actual observations.

*Luca Boccioli,Lorenzo Roberti*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the effects of different stellar evolution codes and explosion models on nucleosynthetic yields in core-collapse supernovae, showing that realistic neutrino-driven explosions better match observations than simpler piston/bomb models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainties in explosive nucleosynthesis caused by varied progenitor models and simplistic explosion assumptions, which lead to errors in explosion energy and mass cut estimations.

Method: Explored a large sample of progenitors from FRANEC, KEPLER, and MESA codes using the GR1D+ explosion code with advanced microphysics/neutrino transport. Calculated nucleosynthetic yields with SkyNet post-processing.

Result: Simulations matched observed II-P, IIb, Ib supernova parameters and current 3D models. Found piston/bomb models overproduce Fe-peak elements, while explodability discrepancies affect lighter elements.

Conclusion: Neutrino-driven explosion models provide more accurate nucleosynthetic predictions than simplistic models, with explodability strongly influencing light element yields.

Abstract: Explosive nucleosynthesis is affected by many uncertainties, particularly
regarding assumptions and prescriptions adopted during the evolution of the
star. Moreover, simple explosion models are often used in the literature, which
can introduce large errors in the assumed explosion energy and mass cut. In
this paper, our goal is to analyze the explosion properties and nucleosynthesis
of a large range of progenitors from three different stellar evolution codes:
FRANEC, KEPLER, and MESA. In particular, we will show the differences between
the neutrino-driven explosions simulated in this work with the much simpler
bomb and piston models that are typically widely used in the literature. We
will then focus on the impact of different explodabilities and different
explosion dynamics on the nucleosynthetic yields. We adopt the neutrino-driven
core-collapse supernova explosion code GR1D+, i.e. a spherically symmetric
model with state-of-the-art microphysics and neutrino transport and a
time-dependent mixing-length model for neutrino-driven convection. We carry out
explosions up to several seconds after bounce, and then calculate the
nucleosynthetic yields with the post-processing code SkyNet. We find that our
1D+ simulations yield explosion energies and remnant masses in agreement with
observations of type II-P, IIb, and Ib supernovae, as well as with the most
recent 3D simulations of the explosion. We provide a complete set of yields for
all the stars simulated, including rotating, low-metallicity, and binary
progenitors. Finally, we find that piston and bomb models, compared to more
realistic neutrino-driven explosions, can artificially increase the production
of Fe-peak elements, whereas the different explodability tends to cause
discrepancies in the lighter elements.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper aims to improve the precision of empirical correlations (Amati and Yonetoku) in GRBs using joint spectral analysis of Fermi GBM/LAT/LLE data from 37 GRBs, enhancing cosmological parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical GRB correlations suffer from uncertainties in spectral indices and E_p. Joint analysis with combined instruments can reduce these uncertainties, which is crucial for accurate cosmological probes.

Method: Analyzed 37 GRBs observed by Fermi GBM, LAT with LLE (2008-2024). Compared joint fits (GBM-LAT-LLE) vs GBM-only for time-integrated T90 and rest-frame peak flux. Re-examined Amati (Ei_p-Eiso) and Yonetoku (Ei_p-Liso) relations.

Result: Joint spectral analysis reduces uncertainties in E_p and spectral indices, improving the precision of Amati and Yonetoku correlations for GRB energetics studies and cosmological parameter estimation.

Conclusion: Enhanced correlations enable better GRB-based cosmological measurements. Joint instrumental data is critical for reducing uncertainties, supporting their use as reliable cosmological probes.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes for
exploring the distant Universe, owing to their immense luminosities and
detectability at high redshifts. Several empirical correlations have been
established, particularly involving their energy properties. This work aims to
enhance the precision of these correlations through joint spectral analysis,
focusing on reducing uncertainties in both the spectral indices and the peak
energy ($E_{\rm p}$) derived from spectral fitting. We extend previous studies
using both traditional and novel spectral models, utilizing a sample of 37 GRBs
observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope
(LAT), incorporating the LAT Low-Energy (LLE) technique, over the period
2008-2024. Our analysis compares results from joint fits (GBM-LAT-LLE) against
those from GBM-only fits. The study focuses on fitting time-integrated ${\rm
T}_{90}$ and peak flux in the rest frame. Among the observable phenomenological
correlations, we revisit the Amati and Yonetoku relations: the Amati relation
links the intrinsic peak energy ($E_{i,\rm p}$) to the total isotropic energy
($E_{\rm iso}$) emitted during ${\rm T}_{90}$, while the Yonetoku relation
connects $E_{i,\rm p}$ to the isotropic luminosity ($L_{\rm iso}$). Refining
these correlations aims to deepen our understanding of GRB energetics and
improve the precision of cosmological parameter estimates derived from GRB
observations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The physical origin of soft X-ray excess (SE) is a long lasting question,
with two prevailing theories -- ``warm corona'' and ``ionized reflection'' --
dominating the discussion. In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from
upscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV
emission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the
illumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily
correlate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of
the series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a
sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \citet{Chen+2025a}. Our
extensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV
that remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim
10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still
statistically significant ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}$). These
findings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome
of the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is
essential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally,
we report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index
($\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential
competition between the warm and hot coronae. Finally, we find that the
$\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$ values we derived with SE properly incorporated exhibit a
much weaker correlation with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ ($p_\mathrm{null}=2\times
10^{-2}$) than previously reported in the literature. This highlights the
critical role of accurately modeling SE in studies of the
$\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$--$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relation.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents a catalog of 7918 blazars and candidates, the largest to date, along with their multiband optical light curves and various astrophysical parameters. Analysis reveals key characteristics of optical variability, such as faster rise than decay in flares, dependence on synchrotron peak frequency, and relationships between flare times, amplitudes, and Doppler factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blazars exhibit extreme variability due to relativistic jets, but the origins and properties of this variability are not fully understood. The need for a large, well-characterized sample drives the creation of this catalog to enable deeper analysis.

Method: The catalog combines blazar-dominated AGN samples with multi-survey data (CRTS, ATLAS, ZTF) to compile 15 years of nightly optical flux measurements, alongside parameters like SED peak frequencies and Doppler factors. Bayesian blocks analysis is applied to light curves.

Result: (1) Flares show steeper decay than rise slopes. (2) Optical variability is strongly linked to synchrotron peak frequency. (3) Flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lacs behave similarly when normalized by peak frequency. (4) Higher Doppler factors correlate with shorter flare times and larger amplitudes.

Conclusion: The dataset enables unprecedented studies of AGN variability. Results support synchrotron emission models and offer insights into jet dynamics, emphasizing the role of Doppler factor in modulating observed flares.

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the brightest and most variable
objects in the universe. Those with relativistic jets observed at small viewing
angles are blazars. Due to Doppler-boosting, blazars exhibit extreme stochastic
variability. While the origin of this variability is thought to be changes in
the accretion flow and jet dynamics, much about blazar variability remains
unknown. In this paper we use several blazar-dominated AGN samples to form a
catalog of 7918 blazars and candidates -- the largest to date. We also collect
source types, redshifts, spectral energy distribution (SED) peak frequencies,
radio variability Doppler factors, and X-ray flux densities for as many sources
as possible. We use all-sky surveys (CRTS, ATLAS, and ZTF, abbreviated as
``CAZ'') to extract their optical multiband flux density on a nightly basis
between 2007 and 2023, and construct as long and as high cadence light curves
as possible for as many sources as attainable. The catalog and its light curves
are provided in the accompanying electronic tables, enabling many analyses
involving AGN variability with unprecedented sample-sizes. We quantify the
variability of the light curves, and apply the Bayesian blocks algorithm to
determine their flaring periods. We find: (1) optical flares generally have a
faster rise than decay; (2) optical brightness and variability are strongly
dependent on the synchrotron peak frequency; (3) flat spectrum radio quasars
and BL Lac objects have comparable optical variability and flare
characteristics at the same synchrotron peak frequency; and (4) optical flare
times tend to decrease and amplitudes increase with increasing radio
variability Doppler factor.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Over the past decade, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected a few
hundreds of high-energy (HE) neutrinos from cosmic sources. Despite numerous
studies searching for their origin, it is still not known which source
populations emit them. A few confident individual associations exist with
active galactic nuclei (AGN), mostly with blazars which are jetted AGN whose
jet points in our direction. Nonetheless, on a population level,
blazar-neutrino correlation strengths are rather weak. This could mean that
blazars as a population do not emit HE neutrinos, or that the detection power
of the tests is insufficient due to the strong atmospheric neutrino background.
By assuming an increase in HE neutrino emission during major blazar flares, in
our previous studies we leveraged the arrival time of the neutrinos to boost
the detection power. In this paper we utilize the same principle while
substantially increasing the number of blazars. We search for the
spatio-temporal correlation of 356 IceCube HE neutrinos with major optical
flares of 3225 radio- and 3814 $\gamma$-ray-selected blazars. We find that,
despite the increase in data size, the number of confident spatio-temporal
associations remains low and the overall correlation strengths weak. Two
individual associations drive our strongest and the only $>$2$\sigma$
post-trial spatio-temporal correlation, occurring with the BL Lac objects of
the radio-selected blazar sample. We estimate that $\lesssim$8\% of the
detected cosmic neutrinos were emitted by blazars during major optical flares.
As a complementary analysis, we compare the synchrotron peak frequency,
redshift, Doppler factor, X-ray brightness, and optical variability of
spatially neutrino-associated blazars to those of the general blazar
population. We find that spatially neutrino-associated blazars of the tested
samples have higher than average Doppler factor and X-ray brightness.

Abstract: We present the second and final set of TRAPUM searches for pulsars at 1284
MHz inside supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae with the MeerKAT
telescope. No new pulsars were detected for any of the 80 targets, which
include some unidentified TeV sources that could be pulsar wind nebulae. The
mean upper limit on the flux density of undetected pulsars is 52 $\mu$Jy, which
includes the average sensitivity loss across the coherent beam tiling pattern.
This survey is the largest and most sensitive multi-target campaign of its
kind. We explore the selection effects that precluded discoveries by testing
the parameters of the survey iteratively against many simulated populations of
young pulsars in supernova remnants. For the synthetic pulsars that were
undetected, we find evidence that, after beaming effects are accounted for,
about 45 per cent of pulsars are too faint, 30 per cent are too smeared by
scattering, and a further 25 per cent have a modelled projected location which
places them outside their supernova remnant. The simulations are repeated for
the S1 subband of the MeerKAT S-band receivers, resulting in a 50-150 per cent
increase in the number of discoveries compared to L-band depending on the flux
density limit achieved. Therefore, higher frequency searches that can also
achieve improved flux density limits are the best hope for future targeted
searches. We also report updated properties for the two previous discoveries,
including a polarimetry study of PSR J1831$-$0941 finding a rotation measure of
401$\pm$1 rad m$^2$.

Abstract: Wideband timing of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
Waves (NANOGrav) datasets, where a single time-of-arrival (TOA) and a single
dispersion measure (DM) are measured using the entire bandwidth of each
observation, was first done for the 12.5-year dataset, and proved to be
invaluable for characterizing the time-varying dispersion measure, reducing the
data volume, and for improving the overall timing precision. The Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Telescope has been observing most
NANOGrav millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at nearly daily cadence (compared to
roughly monthly cadence for other NANOGrav observations) since 2019 with the
objective of integration into future pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets. In
this paper, we show the results of integration of high-cadence,
low-observing-frequency CHIME data with data from the NANOGrav experiment for
an isolated MSP PSR~J0645$+$5158 and three binary MSPs PSR~J1012$+$5307,
PSR~J2145$-$0750, and PSR~J2302$+$4442. Using a wideband timing pipeline which
we also describe, we present updated timing results for all four sources,
including improvements in measurements of relativistic post-Keplerian
parameters for the three binary pulsars in this analysis. For PSR~J2302$+$4442,
we report an updated strong detection of Shapiro delay from which we measured a
companion mass of $0.35^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\ M_{\odot}$, a pulsar mass of
$1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\ M_{\odot}$, and an orbital inclination of
${80^{\circ}}^{+1}_{-2}$. We also report updated constraints on the reflex
motion for PSR~J2145$-$0750 using a combination of Very Long Baseline Array
astrometry and our updated measurement of the time derivative of the projected

### [55] [The origin of the spectral versus dynamical age discrepancy in radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16705)
*Larissa Jerrim,Stas Shabala,Ross Turner,Patrick Yates-Jones,Martin Krause,Georgia Stewart,Chris Power*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Turbulent magnetic fields in radio galaxy lobes do not significantly affect spectral age determinations; however, underestimation of ages is primarily due to electron population mixing. The equatorial regions show more spectral steepening, and conventional models fail to capture the dynamics captured in the simulations, with young, high-energy electrons being main contributors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies in lob age estimates caused by potential factors like electron re-acceleration, population mixing, and turbulent magnetic fields.

Method: 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of high-energy jets to analyze lobe magnetic field structures and their impact on synchrotron radio spectra.

Result: Spectral ages with/without magnetic field structure are consistent, indicating mixing as the main cause of underestimation. Equatorial regions show steeper spectra. Traditional models (e.g., continuous injection, Jaffe-Perola, Tribble) don't align with simulation results.

Conclusion: Magnetic turbulence isn't the key factor in age underestimation; instead, electron mixing dominates. Young particles in high-field regions mainly drive observed spectra, challenging existing models.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of turbulent magnetic fields on the observed
spectral properties of synchrotron radio emission in large-scale radio galaxy
lobes. We use three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
fast, high-powered jets to study the structure of the lobe magnetic fields and
how this structure affects the radio spectrum of the lobes. It has previously
been argued that lobe ages inferred from radio spectra underestimate the true
ages of radio galaxies due to re-acceleration of electrons in the lobe, mixing
of electron populations, or the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in the
lobes. We find that the spectral ages with and without accounting for the lobe
magnetic field structure are consistent with each other, suggesting that mixing
of radiating populations of different ages is the primary cause of the
underestimation of radio lobe ages. By accounting for the structure of lobe
magnetic fields, we find greater spectral steepening in the equatorial regions
of the lobe. We demonstrate that the assumptions of the continuous injection,
Jaffe-Perola, and Tribble models for radio lobe spectra do not hold in our
simulations, and we show that young particles with high magnetic field
strengths are the dominant contributors to the overall radio lobe spectrum.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes seven X-ray bursts from Terzan 5 X-3/Swift J174805.3-244637 observed by NICER in 2023, observing burst property evolution linked to fuel composition and accretion rate. Enhanced Poynting-Robertson drag effects correlate with luminosity, aligning with theoretical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the evolution of thermonuclear X-ray bursts and test theoretical predictions about ignition conditions and accretion rates in neutron stars.

Method: Detailed spectral analysis of NICER observations, modeling persistent emission with variable $f_a$ parameter, and comparing touchdown luminosities/recurrence times against theoretical Eddington limits and burning predictions.

Result: Observed transition from mixed hydrogen/helium to pure helium ignition when accretion rate dropped below ~10% Eddington. Strongest $f_a$ (~6-8) during pure helium PRE bursts. Results consistent with massive neutron star ($\sim2 M_\odot$) and theoretical models.

Conclusion: The observations confirm theoretical scenarios where fuel composition changes with accretion rate, validated through spectral modeling and two independent verification methods.

Abstract: We presented a detailed analysis of seven thermonuclear X-ray bursts from
Terzan 5 X-3/Swift J174805.3-244637, detected by NICER during the source's 2023
outburst. Our analysis reveals a clear evolution of burst properties,
identifying four non-photospheric radius expansion (non-PRE) bursts, one PRE
candidate occurring in a mixed hydrogen/helium environment, and two powerful
PRE bursts from pure helium ignition. The time-resolved burst spectra were well
described by a model including a variable persistent emission component,
quantified by a factor $f_a$, due to the Poynting-Robertson drag. The strength
of this interaction scales with burst luminosity: the enhancement is absent
($f_a \approx 1$) in the faintest bursts, becomes modest ($f_a \approx 1.5-2$)
for the more luminous non-PRE burst and the PRE candidate, and is very strong
($f_a \approx 6-8$) during the pure-helium PRE bursts. This observed transition
from mixed-fuel to pure-helium burning as the local mass accretion rate dropped
below $\sim$10% of the Eddington limit, $\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$, aligns with
theoretical predictions. We verified this scenario with two independent
methods. First, at the known distance to Terzan 5, the touchdown luminosities
of both the pure helium PRE bursts and the mixed-fuel PRE candidate are
consistent with reaching their respective, composition-dependent Eddington
limits on the same plausible, massive neutron star of $\sim 2 M_\odot$. Second,
the observed recurrence times of the non-PRE bursts were consistent with
predictions for mixed-fuel burning.

Abstract: I explore the origin of the circumstellar (CS) shell of the unusual SN Ia
2020aeuh based on the light curve model abd observational constraints. I
estimate the $^{56}$Ni mass ($1.1 M\odot$), CS shell mass ($0.04-0.2 M\odot$),
radius ($2\times10^{16}$ cm), and expansion velocity $\lesssim 200$ km/s. Large
$^{56}$Ni mass and properties of the CS shell are consistent with the scenario
of massive binary white dwarf merger that has been accompanied with the
ejection of $\sim 0.1 M\odot$ of matter. It is argued that SN~2020aeuh exploded
not earlier than 30 yr after the merger.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the transient SN 2025ulz, initially suspected as a kilonova linked to gravitational waves from S250818k. Through multi-wavelength data, it is identified as a Type IIb supernova. A novel scoring algorithm is introduced to assess kilonova likelihood based on 3D location and light curve, showing that SN 2025ulz was not the best candidate. This method could improve real-time transient prioritization in future searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing kilonovae from impostor transients in gravitational wave follow-up observations, and to optimize telescope resource allocation by prioritizing genuine candidates.

Method: Multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz were analyzed. A scoring algorithm was developed to evaluate kilonova likelihood using transient 3D position and light curve evolution. The algorithm was applied to other candidates within the S250818k localization volume.

Result: SN 2025ulz was confirmed as a Type IIb supernova, not a kilonova. The algorithm showed at least 4 other candidates had higher scores than SN 2025ulz post-discovery, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying higher-priority targets.

Conclusion: The scoring algorithm effectively differentiates kilonova candidates from non-kilonova transients. Its real-time application during gravitational wave follow-ups can enhance efficiency by focusing observations on more promising targets, conserving valuable telescope time.

Abstract: Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron
star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients. Optical follow-up
campaigns are plagued by impostors whose early evolution masquerades as the
rapid radioactive decay of heavy elements. In this work, we present an analysis
of the multi-wavelength dataset of supernova (SN) 2025ulz, a proposed kilonova
candidate following the low-significance detection of gravitational waves
originating from the potential binary neutron star merger S250818k. Despite an
early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN
2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we
demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to
determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based
primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution. We also apply our
scoring algorithm to other transient candidates in the localization volume of
S250818k and find that, at all times after the discovery of SN 2025ulz, there
are $\geq 4$ candidates with a score more promising than SN 2025ulz. During
future kilonova searches, this type of scoring algorithm will be useful to rule
out contaminating transients in real time, optimizing the use of valuable
telescope resources.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Iron cosmic rays represent the most abundant heavy nuclei at energies above 1
TeV, with their production thought to be primarily originated by astrophysical
sources. Therefore, measuring the iron spectrum provides crucial insights into
the origin, acceleration, and propagation mechanisms of cosmic rays. While
recent results from space-based detectors have revealed unexpected energy
dependences in the GeV-TeV range, these measurements are limited by low
statistics at higher energies. At energies above a few TeV, ground-based
detectors, such as the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC)
telescopes, become more effective due to their large collec- tion areas,
enabling them to extend and complement the capabilities of space-borne
instruments. In this work, we apply the so-called direct Cherenkov technique,
which accounts for the radiation emitted by charged particles before the
cascade develops in the atmosphere, with MAGIC to identify iron-induced air
showers and distinguish them from those produced by lighter cosmic-ray species.

### [60] [An Overview of the Effect of Self-Gravity on the Structure of Accretion Discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17225)
*Darashan Saikia,Liza Devi,Biplob Sarkar,Asish Jyoti Boruah*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This review examines how self-gravity (SG) in accretion discs (ADs) affects their structure, angular momentum transport, gravitational instabilities (GIs), and their roles in phenomena like star/planet formation and gamma-ray bursts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The assumption in conventional accretion disc theory that the central object's gravity dominates fails when the disc's mass becomes significant. SG must be analyzed to understand structural changes, dynamical effects, and evolutionary impacts in systems like XRBs, AGN, and YSOs.

Method: A comprehensive review of SG's influence on radial/vertical AD structures, angular momentum transport mechanisms, GIs evolution, fragmentation processes, and connections to astrophysical phenomena like stellar/planetary formation, AGN dynamics, and GRBs.

Result: SG significantly alters AD dynamics through gravitational instabilities, enabling fragmentation that drives formation processes. It modifies AM transport beyond standard mechanisms, impacting disc evolution and observable phenomena.

Conclusion: SG is a critical factor in shaping accretion disc behavior, particularly in high-mass-disc scenarios. Future studies need to integrate SG effects into models for accurate predictions of structure, evolution, and associated astrophysical events.

Abstract: In astrophysical systems like X-ray binaries (XRBs), active galactic nuclei
(AGN), and young stellar objects (YSOs), we often observe a very fundamental
structure called accretion discs(ADs). Conventional AD theory usually supposes
that the gravitational field is controlled by a central compact object. This
assumption breaks down when the mass of the disc becomes considerable in
contrast to that of the massive central object. In these cases, the AD's
self-gravity (SG) can drastically change its structure, dynamics, and
evolution. This review investigates how SG influences the radial and vertical
structure of ADs and how it modifies the mechanisms that transport angular
momentum (AM). Along with these, this review also tries to explore how
gravitational instabilities (GIs) evolve and how they affect disc fragmentation
and astrophysical phenomena like stellar and planetary formation, AGN dynamics,
and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

### [61] [A Common Synchrotron Origin for Prompt Gamma-Ray and Soft X-Ray Emission in GRBs: Evidence from Joint Spectral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17323)
*Ziming Wang,Chenyu Wang,He Gao,Hua Feng,An Li,Lin Lin,Songyu Shen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of 110 pulses from 46 GRBs using Swift data reveals that prompt emission spectra from 0.5 keV to 150 keV are well described by a single power-law with breaks around a few keV, consistent with synchrotron radiation in a fast-cooling regime. This supports a common origin for X-ray and gamma-ray emissions from a single emission region, with spectral evolution driven by synchrotron cooling dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing detection of long GRBs with early soft X-ray flux during gamma-ray emission raises questions about whether their multi-band prompt emissions share a common origin and mechanism. Existing data from EP and SVOM necessitate a systematic analysis to address this.

Method: Analyzed 20-year Swift archival data of 46 GRBs with 110 temporal pulses. Applied joint spectral fitting using a single power-law model with breaks/cutoffs, examining spectral indices and evolution across 0.5-150 keV.

Result: Most pulses require a spectral break around ~few keV, with average indices α₁=-0.88 and α₂=-1.46 consistent with synchrotron fast-cooling. Spectral evolution patterns and index distributions indicate a single-emission-region origin, linking observed X-ray/gamma-ray light curve differences to cooling frequency ν_c and emission width effects.

Conclusion: Prompt emissions across broad energy bands likely originate from a single synchrotron-emitting region where observed multi-band variations are explained by synchrotron cooling frequency evolution and emission geometry, rather than separate emission mechanisms.

Abstract: The recent launches of the Einstein Probe (EP) and the Space Variable Objects
Monitor (SVOM) mission have led to the detection of a growing number of long
GRBs with significant, early soft X-ray flux during their gamma-ray emission,
prompting the question of whether their multi-band prompt emission shares a
common origin in region and mechanism. To address this, we utilize the 20-year
Swift archival data, which provides a substantial sample of joint soft X-ray
and gamma-ray observations, enabling a systematic joint spectral study. We
resolve 110 temporal pulses from 46 GRBs and find that a single power-law model
with a low-energy break or cutoff adequately describes the prompt spectra from
150 keV down to 0.5 keV. More than half of the sample pulses require a break
around a few keV, with average spectral indices $\langle \alpha_1 \rangle =
-0.88$ and $\langle \alpha_2 \rangle = -1.46$ consistent with synchrotron
radiation in a marginally fast-cooling regime. The observed spectral evolution
and the distribution of indices support a single-emission-region origin, where
the varying spectral shapes are largely governed by the evolution of the
synchrotron cooling frequency $\nu_c$ and the effect of finite emission width.
The observed differences in the temporal behavior between X-ray and gamma-ray
light curves can be naturally explained by this spectral evolution across the
broad band.

*Leo P. Mulholland,Catherine A. Ramsbottom,Connor P. Ballance,Albert Sneppen,Stuart A. Sim*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents accurate atomic data for tellurium ions (Te IV and V) using the R-matrix and MCDHF methods, improving spectral modeling of kilonovae and analyzing their contribution to observed emission features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current kilonova spectral models rely on approximate atomic data, especially for heavy elements like tellurium. Accurate data for Te IV and V are scarce and critical for understanding emission features like the 1.08 µm observed in AT2017gfo.

Method: Atomic data for Te ions were computed using MCDHF for atomic structures and radiative rates, with R-matrix method for electron collisions and photoionization. Synthetic spectra from collisional radiative models were compared to observations.

Result: The generated data address literature gaps, showing Te IV potentially contributes to the 1.08 µm feature alongside Sr II's P-Cygni profile. Improved spectral modeling accuracy is demonstrated.

Conclusion: Accurate Te atomic data enhance kilonova simulations, aiding interpretations of observed features and validating theoretical models against AT2017gfo data.

Abstract: Spectral modelling of kilonovae (KNe) require large amounts of collisional
excitation and photoionization atomic data for lowly ionised (neutral, singly
and doubly ionised) species of heavy elements. Much of the data currently used
is calculated using approximate hydrogenic results or adopts semi-empirical
formulae. We present atomic data for ions of tellurium (Te) computed using the
well-known $R$-matrix method. Results will also be presented for radiative and
thermal collisions of Te IV and V, for which the required atomic data are also
typically limited in the literature. The Multi-Configuration-Dirac-Hartree-Fock
(MCDHF) method is used to produce model atomic structures and radiative rates.
These model structures are then used to calculate electron-impact-excitation
and photoionization cross-sections. The resulting excitation and radiative
rates are further used in a collisional radiative model to produce synthetic
spectra, which are compared with observations. We also investigate the
possibility of Te IV contributing to the 1.08 $\mu$m emission feature in the
mid-epochs of AT2017gfo alongside the established P-Cygni feature of Sr II.

Abstract: The dark matter track at ICRC~2025 showed a field in transition. Direct
detection has entered the \emph{neutrino-floor era}, with XENONnT and PandaX-4T
now limited by Solar neutrinos. Indirect searches have become truly
\emph{multimessenger}, combining $\gamma$-rays, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and
radio data under unified likelihoods and shared systematics. Non-WIMP
candidates -- axions, sub-GeV particles, primordial black holes, macroscopic
relics -- are becoming central. Across all fronts, progress depends as much on
new detectors as on the coherence of shared data, methods, and analysis
frameworks. Here, I distill the main experimental and conceptual shifts behind
these trends, noting how assumptions have evolved since ICRC~2023 and where the
next decisive advances are likely to come.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of
binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with four distinct magnetic field topologies:
(i) a dipole pulsar-like configuration, (ii) a mixed linear superposition of
poloidal and toroidal components inside the star, and (iii-iv) two topologies
featuring a smooth transition from a confined mixed core to a pulsar-like
structure at radii $0.95\,R_{\rm NS}$ and $0.5\,R_{\rm NS}$, with $R_{\rm NS}$
the radius of the star. The latter topologies are explored in BNS merger
studies for the first time. We evolve systems with two equations of state
(EoS), SLy and WFF1, with ADM masses 2.7 and 2.6, respectively, and include an
additional lower-mass SLy binary to probe the behavior of long-lived remnants.
We perform an extensive analysis of the emission properties of the systems,
both electromagnetic and gravitational waves, and of the properties of the
remnants, namely their frequency modes, density eigenfunctions, rotation,
temperature, and convective stability. We report three key results: (1) for the
first time, we assess the convective stability of magnetized remnants,
extending previous unmagnetized analyses; (2) we identify a clear secondary
peak in the gravitational-wave spectrum of pulsar-like configurations,
consistent with the nonlinear coupling of the $m=0$ and $m=2$ modes, which is
absent in other topologies; and (3) the magnetic field topology strongly
influences the gravitational wave emission properties to the extent that nearby
($<50\,{\rm Mpc}$) events could allow one to observationally distinguish
between different field structures with future gravitational-wave detectors.
Across all models, we obtain luminosities compatible with short gamma-ray
bursts (sGRBs), with purely poloidal configurations being the most efficient in
driving possible relativistic jets.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of Hilbert-Huang transform on 3D simulations of core-collapse supernovae to identify SASI-induced gravitational waves and neutrino signals, aiming to improve understanding of explosion mechanisms with Einstein Telescope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of definitive evidence for the core-collapse supernova mechanism by leveraging combined gravitational wave and neutrino observations, focusing on SASI's role which links these signatures.

Method: Applies Hilbert-Huang transform to analyze 3D numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, targeting SASI-induced effects to extract instantaneous frequencies relevant for Einstein Telescope detection.

Result: Evaluates the effectiveness of the method in identifying SASI contributions, providing insights for future gravitational wave and neutrino detection with Einstein Telescope.

Conclusion: The method offers a promising approach to dissect SASI dynamics, enhancing the potential for unraveling supernova explosion mechanisms through multi-messenger observations.

Abstract: Core collapse supernovae are among the most energetic astrophysical events in
the Universe. Despite huge efforts on understanding the main ingredients
triggering such explosions, we still lack of compelling evidences for the
precise mechanism driving those phenomena. They are expected to produce
gravitational waves due to asymmetric mass motions in the collapsing core, and
emit in the meanwhile neutrinos as a result of the interactions in their
high-density environment. The combination of these two cosmic messengers can
provide a unique probe to study the inner engine of these processes and unveil
the explosion mechanism. Among the possible detectable signature, standing
accretion shock instabilities (SASI) are particularly relevant in this context
as they establish a direct connection between gravitational wave emission and
the outcoming neutrino flux. In this work, Hilbert-Huang transform is applied
to a selected sample of 3D numerical simulations, with the aim of identifying
SASI contribution and extract its instantaneous frequency. The performance of
the method is evaluated in the context of Einstein Telescope.

TL;DR: The paper uses high-resolution simulations to study clumpy super-Eddington outflows from a supermassive black hole in PDS 456, replicating observed properties like clump size, velocity, density, and optical depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows following new XRISM observations revealing clumpy structures in PDS 456.

Method: Conducted 2D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial/boundary conditions to model outflows from super-Eddington accretion flows.

Result: Simulations produced clumpy outflows matching observed characteristics: ~10 rg clump size, 0.05-0.2 c velocities, 5 clumps line-of-sight, densities 1e-13-1e-12 g/cm³, and 1-10 electron scattering optical depth. Clump origins traced to within 300 rg.

Conclusion: The observed clumpy wind properties are well explained by radiation-driven acceleration from accretion flow regions within 300 rg of the black hole.

Abstract: Recent advances in X-ray spectroscopic observation have enabled researchers
to reveal distinct clumpy structures in the super-Eddington outflows from the
supermassive black hole in PDS 456 (XRISM Collaboration 2025), initiating
detailed investigation of fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows.
In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial
and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington
accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy
outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles,
exhibiting typical properties such as a size of ~10 rg (where rg is the
gravitational radius), a velocity of ~0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of
light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities
are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained
from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of
10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is
approximately 1-10. The clumpy winds accelerated by radiation force are
considered to originate from the region within <~300 rg.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The MeerTRAP project using MeerKAT identified 30 new Galactic sources, mostly likely RRATs. Nine were localized to arcsecond precision, with periods derived for 14. Follow-up with Effelsberg confirmed long periods, including the fourth slowest pulsar. Some sources show unique emission features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover new transient radio sources in the Galaxy and study their properties, particularly RRATs, which have low pulse rates and provide insights into neutron star behavior.

Method: Single pulse search with MeerKAT telescope, localization using transient buffer data, timing analysis of single pulses, and follow-up observations with Effelsberg telescope.

Result: 30 new sources detected (likely RRATs), nine localized to arcseconds, 14 periods determined (121ms–7.623s), three confirmed with Effelsberg showing long periods, and specific emission features observed in some pulsars.

Conclusion: MeerTRAP effectively discovers rare neutron star systems like RRATs. Low duty cycles align with pulsar trends, and findings expand understanding of slow pulsar populations and emission mechanisms.

Abstract: We present the discovery of 30 new Galactic sources from the MeerTRAP
project, a commensal fast radio transient search programme using the MeerKAT
telescope. These sources were all identified via a single pulse search. Most of
them are likely to be rotating radio transients (RRATs) given their low pulse
rates. Using data captured in our transient buffer we have localised nine
sources in the image domain to arcsecond precision. This facilitates the timing
of these sources and further follow-up with other telescopes. Using the arrival
times of single pulses, we have constrained the periods of 14 sources, ranging
from 121ms to 7.623s, and derived a phase-coherent timing solution for one of
them. Follow-up observations of the MeerTRAP sources (including those published
previously) performed with the Effelsberg telescope have detected regular but
faint emission from three sources, confirming their long rotation period,
including PSR J2218+2902 with a period of 17.5s, the fourth slowest in the
radio pulsar population. A few of the sources exhibit interesting emission
features, such as periodic microstructure in PSR J1243-0435 and possible
nulling in PSR J1911-2020 and PSR J1243-0435. We find that the duty cycles of
the three newly discovered pulsars are very low and follow the general trend
for the duty cycle with period of known pulsars.

*Keidai Iiyama,Grace Gao*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper evaluates different lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS), analyzing how constellation design parameters affect coverage, precision, and operational costs. Key findings include optimal orbital configurations for polar vs global coverage and trade-offs in orbit insertion costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish reliable PNT services on the Moon, the study addresses the need for efficient satellite constellations that balance coverage, accuracy, and mission costs under varying orbital parameters.

Method: A trade-off analysis of three Walker-constellation families (using elliptical and circular frozen orbits) across different semi-major axes and inclinations, evaluating coverage, PDOP, orbit determination accuracy, receiver noise, and insertion costs.

Result: Larger semi-major axes improve polar and global coverage but increase errors and noise. South ELFO constellations excel in polar regions with better PDOP, while CLFO offers uniform global coverage. Orbit insertion trade-offs exist between transfer duration, ΔV, and C3 values.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for designing LANS constellations, highlighting optimal orbital parameters based on mission requirements and operational constraints.

Abstract: The establishment of a sustainable human presence on the Moon demands robust
positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services capable of supporting both
surface and orbital operations. This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off
analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented
Navigation Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital
parameters influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit
determination accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost. Three
Walker-constellation families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits
are examined to characterize their relative advantages across different
semi-major axes and inclinations. Results show that larger semi-major axes
enhance both polar and global coverage, though the optimal inclination depends
on the constellation type and target service region. The south elliptical lunar
frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior performance for
polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit (CLFO) Walker
configuration achieves the best global uniformity. Orbit determination errors
and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher
inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received
signal power at apolune for eccentric orbits. Orbit insertion analysis reveals
clear trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy ($C_3$) at
trans-lunar injection, and insertion $\Delta V$: shorter transfers require
higher insertion $\Delta V$, while low-energy transfers achieve smaller $\Delta
V$ at the cost of months-long durations and higher $C_3$. These findings
provide a systematic framework for designing LANS constellations for both
regional and global coverage.

Abstract: Image regridding and coaddition have a wide range of applications in
astronomical observations. {\sc Imcom}, an algorithm that provides control over
point spread function (PSF) and noise in coadded images, has been found to meet
the stringent requirements of weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the
forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. In this work, I introduce a new
algorithm, Fast {\sc Imcom}, which outperforms traditional {\sc Imcom} in terms
of both efficiency and quality. After explaining the underlying philosophy and
mathematical formalism, I conduct systematic comparisons between {\sc Imcom}
and Fast {\sc Imcom} in terms of PSF reconstruction in 1D. While a 2D
implementation is beyond the scope of this paper, I demonstrate how to
generalize Fast {\sc Imcom} to 2D and discuss practical issues involved. This
new algorithm has the potential of reducing both the computational costs and
storage requirements (current estimates are $\sim 100\,{\rm M}$ core hours and
$\sim 1.5 \,{\rm PB}$, respectively) of the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey
(HLIS) by an order of magnitude. Meanwhile, it provides implications for the
dithering patterns of Roman surveys. I also address potential applications of
Fast {\sc Imcom} beyond the Roman HLIS, with focus on other weak lensing
programs and Roman time domain surveys; the actual range of use cases is likely
beyond what is discussed here.

Abstract: Solar eclipses offer unparalleled opportunities for public engagement in
astronomy. Large groups of people often gather to view eclipses, and these
events require affordable and easy to use tools to safely observe the Sun. One
unique way to observe a solar eclipse is by using a disco ball. Here, we
present an analysis of the experiences of educators who used a disco ball as a
solar projector during various public outreach events. Through a survey
conducted shortly after the April 2024 total solar eclipse and the March 2025
partial solar eclipse, we collected data on the use, engagement, and perceived
educational value of a disco ball projector from 31 individual events. The
results suggest that disco balls were not only affordable and safe, but also

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a nextgeneration
ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope, will require detector
technologies capable of supporting substantially larger pixel-count arrays than
those flown on previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors
(MKIDs) provide a scalable solution through microwave multiplexing and have
already been demonstrated in balloon-borne instruments using Field-Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for real-time signal processing. A central element of MKID
readout is the Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB) spectrometer, which converts
digitized timedomain signals into finely resolved frequency channels for
subsequent analysis. To meet the demands for broader bandwidths and higher
spectral resolution driven by emerging science goals, efficient FPGA-based
implementations of the PFB are essential. This work presents current results
from a fixed-point digital design methodology for deploying the PFB
architecture on spacequalified FPGAs. The approach emphasizes efficient
resource utilization and numerical precision while satisfying stringent
performance constraints, enabling scalable, high-resolution spectral processing
for future space observatories and remote sensing applications.

Abstract: We present TUNA, a Vision-Transformer based network adapted from segmentation
to flux regression for faint, diffuse radio emission. Trained on LOFAR-like
mock observations derived from cosmological simulations, TUNA accurately
reconstructs low surface-brightness structures, with only mild smoothing and
small brightness-dependent biases. Applied to LOFAR data of the A399 - A401
galaxy cluster system, it recovers the ridge not identifiable in the high
resolution observation and matches the low resolution tapered map. These
results indicate how TUNA can deliver automated, quantitative surface
brightness estimates for diffuse extragalactic sources, enabling scalable
analyses for upcoming surveys.

Abstract: Posterior inference on the more than a dozen parameters governing a
gravitational wave (GW) event is challenging. A typical MCMC analysis can take
around $100$ CPU hours, and next generation GW observatories will detect many
thousands of events. Here we present a thorough comparison of the accuracy and
computational cost of the Fisher Matrix, Derivative Approximation for
Likelihoods (DALI) and traditional MCMC methods. We find that using DALI, which
extends the traditional Fisher Matrix (FM) method to higher orders, allows for
a good approximation of the posterior with a $55$ times smaller computational
cost, and that the cost-benefit of the doublet-DALI is better than that of the
triplet-DALI. We also show that the singlet-DALI, a hybrid MCMC-Fisher method,
is much more accurate than the traditional FM and 10 times faster than the
doublet-DALI. A large effort has been invested in forecasting the science case
of different detector configurations, and the ability of making fast yet
accurate estimations of the posteriors is an important step forward. We also
introduce version \texttt{1.0} of the public \texttt{GWDALI} code, which
incorporates automatic differentiation, modern waveforms and an optimized
parameter decomposition.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Variability studies are a powerful tool for studying the structures of
unresolved sources. One such type of variability study, called reverberation
mapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from
an active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,
which demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the
accretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a
corresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the
surrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been
learned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of
a potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust
outflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how
AGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%
of energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in
the near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust
sublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of
the dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the
dust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar
outflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics
(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to
high-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated
from the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and
ground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed
modeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the
distribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to
the accretion disk luminosities.

### [77] [Investigating the Effects of Point Source Injection Strategies on KMTNet Real/Bogus Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17053)
*Dongjin Lee,Gregory S. H. Paek,Seo-Won Chang,Changwan Kim,Mankeun Jeong,Hongjae Moon,Seong-Heon Lee,Jae-Hun Jung,Myungshin Im*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper compares different point source injection methods (Random Injection, Near Galaxy Injection, and a combined approach) for training RB classifiers in astronomical surveys. The combined method best balances detection and false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of transient events and high human labeling costs make creating effective training datasets challenging. Point source injection offers a solution, but optimal strategies are unclear.

Method: Three injection strategies (RI, NGI, combined) were applied to Korea Microlensing Telescope Network data. CNNs were trained on simulated data and tested on real datasets from GW190814 and S230518h observations.

Result: RI works well for asteroids but struggles with transients near galaxies. NGI excels with galactic transients but misclassifies variable stars. The combined approach balances detection rates and false positives.

Conclusion: Injection strategy critically affects RB classifier performance. A combined approach is recommended for robust transient detection in multi-messenger astronomy.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning-based real/bogus (RB) classifiers have
demonstrated effectiveness in filtering out artifacts and identifying genuine
transients in real-time astronomical surveys. However, the rarity of transient
events and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples
pose significant challenges in constructing training datasets for RB
classification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques,
which inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising
solution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point
source injection strategies and their effects on classification performance
within a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct
various training datasets based on Random Injection (RI), Near Galaxy Injection
(NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope
Network datasets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on
simulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced datasets from
gravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive
experimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus
filtering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g.,
supernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near
galaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a
high false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these
trade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate.
Our results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in
developing robust RB classifiers for transient (or multi-messenger) follow-up
campaigns.

Conclusion: Understanding these methodological shifts is crucial for grasping the current state and future trajectory of astronomical research.

Abstract: In this short review, we trace the evolution of inference in astronomy,
highlighting key milestones rather than providing an exhaustive survey. We

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Deep Learning methods to detect satellite streaks in astronomical images, mitigating their impact on observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing visibility of satellites is causing streaks in astronomical images, necessitating extra post-processing to reduce data loss and cosmetic issues.

Method: Testing and adapting various Deep Learning approaches on raw astronomical data from March 2022 to February 2023 captured by smart telescopes.

Result: Not explicitly detailed in the abstract; likely demonstrates the effectiveness of the best method for streak detection.

Conclusion: Deep Learning techniques can be effective in identifying and addressing satellite streaks, suggesting promising solutions for preserving astronomical data quality.

Abstract: The growing negative impact of the visibility of satellites in the night sky
is influencing the practice of astronomy and astrophotograph, both at the
amateur and professional levels. The presence of these satellites has the
effect of introducing streaks into the images captured during astronomical
observation, requiring the application of additional post processing to
mitigate the undesirable impact, whether for data loss or cosmetic reasons. In
this paper, we show how we test and adapt various Deep Learning approaches to
detect streaks in raw astronomical data captured between March 2022 and
February 2023 with smart telescopes.

### [80] [Graph-Based Light-Curve Features for Robust Transient Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17721)
*Jesús D. Petro-Ramos,David J. Ruiz-Morales,D. Sierra-Porta*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes using visibility graphs (HVG, DHVG, W-HVG) to convert astronomical light curves into graph-based descriptors for transient classification, achieving improved macro-F1 and accuracy on the MANTRA benchmark compared to the baseline, without requiring deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of classifying irregular astronomical light curves, the authors sought a survey-agnostic method that can effectively transform time series data into structured graph representations for use with standard classifiers, avoiding the complexity of deep learning architectures.

Method: Astronomical light curves are converted into three visibility-graph types (HVG, DHVG, W-HVG). Compact network descriptors like degree/strength moments, clustering coefficients, motifs, assortativity, path efficiency, and spectral features are extracted. These features are used with LightGBM in a stratified five-fold validation setup.

Result: The best model (LightGBM with combined graph features) achieved a macro-F1 of 0.622 and accuracy of 0.661, surpassing the baseline F1 of 0.528. Ablation studies confirm contributions from weighted contrasts and directed asymmetry features. Performance was strongest for CV, HPM, and Non-Tr classes, with confusion among AGN-Blazar-SN.

Conclusion: Visibility graphs provide an effective, simple approach for converting irregular time series into graph-based features, offering competitive classification performance without deep learning. The method's survey-agnostic nature and reproducibility-through-open-source-release make it a valuable tool for astronomical transient classification.

Abstract: We investigate graph-based representations of astronomical light curves for
transient classification on the MANTRA benchmark. Each series is mapped to
three visibility-graph views-horizontal (HVG), directed (DHVG), and weighted
(W-HVG)-from which we extract compact, length-aware network descriptors
(degree/strength moments, clustering and motifs, assortativity,
path/efficiency, and spectral summaries). Using stratified five-fold validation
and tree-based learners, the best configuration (LightGBM with HVG+DHVG+W-HVG
features) attains a macro-F1 of 0.622 +/- 0.010 and accuracy of 0.661 +/-
0.010, improving over the MANTRA baseline (F1 macro = 0.528). Ablations show
that weighted contrasts and directed asymmetry contribute complementary gains
to undirected topology. Per-class analysis highlights strong performance for
CV, HPM, and Non-Tr., with residual confusions concentrated in the
AGN-Blazar-SN block. These results indicate that visibility graphs offer a
simple, survey-agnostic bridge between irregular photometric time series and
standard classifiers, yielding competitive multiclass performance without
bespoke deep architectures. We release code and feature definitions to
facilitate reproducibility and future extensions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, and tidal love numbers of
anisotropic neutron stars (NSs) have been investigated in $f(R,T)$ gravity by
imposing two equations of state (EoS). We use the simplest form
$f(R,T)=R+2\beta T$ model and adopt the anisotropy approach called Horvat
model. To examine the viability of our calculations, we utilize the constraints
from GW170817 and GW190814 observations. Moreover, we consider three values of
$\beta$, i.e. $\beta=0$, $\beta=-0.01$, $\beta=-0.02$ and four anisotropy
parameters $\alpha$, i.e. $\alpha=-0.12$, $\alpha=-0.06$, $\alpha=0.06$,
$\alpha=0.12$. Our findings suggest that all physical quantities depend on both
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Nevertheless, the impact of $\alpha$ is much
more significant than $\beta$. The calculation of masses satisfy each used
constraints for specific values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In the case of the
moment of inertia, the results are compatible with the constraint obtained from
radio observation of heavy pulsar. On the other hand, the tidal deformability
of the NSs composed of one EoS satisfy the GW170817 constraint while the NSs
composed of the other one EoS are too small. These small numbers can be
interpreted as the property of secondary object observed in GW190814. As a
result, our theoretical investigation of NSs constructed with two EoS can be
NSs candidates for GW170817 and GW190814, respectively.

*Tuhina Ghorui,Prabir Rudra,Farook Rahaman*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper extends the Godel solution in f(Q,T) gravity, demonstrating that causality violation through closed time-like curves persists with non-metricity and various matter contents like perfect fluid or scalar fields, showing deviations from metric theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate causality violation in modified gravity theories by extending the Godel solution, as general relativity and its extensions allow non-globally causal spacetimes.

Method: Formulate f(Q,T) gravity equations, derive solutions with matter contents (perfect fluid, cosmological constant, scalar field), analyze conditions for closed time-like curves.

Result: Classes of solutions exhibit causality violation with non-metricity's significant impact, requiring specific initial conditions but consistently allowing feasible non-causal spacetimes.

Conclusion: Non-metricity in f(Q,T) gravity allows persistent causality violations similar to Godel space, highlighting differences from standard metric theories and the necessity of considering such solutions in theoretical cosmology.

Abstract: In this work, the classical Godel solution from general relativity is
extended into the framework of modified gravity theories based on non-metricity
$Q$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$ in the context of $f(Q,T)$
gravity. The main feature of the Godel solution is the existence of closed
time-like curves, which allow for causality violation and time travel. Since
general relativity and its extensions do not demand spacetime to be globally
causal, there is good motivation to explore such solutions. We have found
classes of solutions with different matter content, like perfect fluid,
cosmological constant, massless scalar field, etc. It is observed that, for
suitable initial conditions, there is always a possibility of obtaining
feasible solutions that violate causality in our setup. The presence of
non-metricity in such solutions produces crucial deviations that are
noteworthy.

Abstract: In this work, we develop the modified Teukolsky formalism that describes the
GW radiation from a point mass orbiting around a perturbed Schwarzschild BH.
This perturbation of the background spacetime induces a secular change in the
orbital phase of the point mass. In turn, this causes a modification in the GW
flux, which can be used to probe the background spacetime. We explicitly apply
this formalism to a bumpy Schwarzschild spacetime as a proof of principle. The
results pave the way for the description of EMRIs in generic perturbed Kerr

Abstract: Recent progress in gravitational self-force theory has led to the development
of a first post-adiabatic (1PA) waveform model for nonspinning, quasicircular
compact binaries [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 241402 (2023)]. In this paper, we
extend that model to allow for a slowly spinning primary black hole and a
generic, precessing spin on the secondary object, restricting to the case of
small misalignment between the primary spin and the orbital angular momentum.
We demonstrate excellent agreement between our waveforms and fully nonlinear
numerical relativity simulations for mass ratios $q\gtrsim 5$ and primary spins
$|\chi_1|\lesssim 0.1$ and arbitrary secondary spin $\chi_2 \lesssim 1$. In
particular we present the re-summed 1PAT1R waveform model, which significantly
improves the accuracy of the original 1PAT1 waveforms for comparable masses and
increasing primary spin. Our models are publicly available in the WaSABI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new hybrid waveform model called WaSABI-C that combines self-force and post-Newtonian methods for binary systems with a spinning primary and nonspinning secondary, achieving significantly improved accuracy over existing models in the extreme mass ratio regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate waveform models in gravitational wave astronomy, especially for systems with extreme mass ratios, where traditional post-Newtonian and adiabatic self-force methods have limitations.

Method: Hybridization of first-order self-force and post-Newtonian results without numerical relativity tuning, designed for quasicircular inspirals with spinning primary and nonspinning secondary, excluding merger and ringdown phases.

Result: The model reduces mismatch with numerical relativity simulations by factors of 2000 (vs. adiabatic self-force) and 40 (vs. post-Newtonian), matching the performance of SEOBNRv5EHM across most parameters covered by SXS catalog simulations (mass ratios 1-15, primary spins -0.8–0.8).

Conclusion: The hybrid approach significantly enhances waveform faithfulness, offering a reliable tool for gravitational wave analysis in systems with intermediate to extreme mass ratios, complementing existing models like SEOBNRv5EHM.

Abstract: We develop and implement a new hybrid waveform model for quasicircular
inspirals with a spinning primary and nonspinning secondary, excluding the
merger and ringdown. This model, which is a core component of the more
extensive WaSABI-C model, consistently assembles all available first-order
self-force and post-Newtonian results through a hybridization procedure without
any tuning to numerical relativity, making it particularly suited for
intermediate to extreme mass ratios. For almost all masses and primary spins,
the resulting hybrid model significantly improves the faithfulness of both
post-Newtonian and adiabatic self-force waveforms considered separately. We
provide detailed comparisons with 50 simulations from the SXS catalog with mass
ratios ranging from 1 to 15 and primary spins ranging from -0.8 to 0.8. The
hybrid model improves the median mismatch against numerical relativity
waveforms by a factor of 2000 with respect to adiabatic waveforms and 40 with
respect to post-Newtonian waveforms. The mismatches are comparable to those
obtained from the SEOBNRv5EHM model in the quasicircular limit over most of the
parameter space covered by NR simulations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates a string T-duality inspired modified cosmology by incorporating a zero-point length correction into gravitational physics. Derived modified Friedmann equations through thermodynamics at the FRW horizon introduce a coupling parameter β, constrained via Bayesian analysis using multiple late-time datasets. Results show β < ~0.001, with no significant improvement over ΛCDM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore cosmological implications of string T-duality and test deviations from the standard ΛCDM model by quantifying effects of quantum gravity corrections via zero-point length.

Method: Modified Friedmann equations derived using thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of FRW universe, incorporating T-duality inspired l₀ correction. Bayesian inference with CosmoMC/MCMC sampling constrained parameters against PantheonPlus, Union3 supernovae, cosmic chronometers, DESI BAO, and GRB data.

Result: Upper limit β ≈ 1e-3 (68% CL) shows minimal deviation from ΛCDM. Model comparison (AIC) shows no significant preference over standard model, indicating negligible improvement in data fitting.

Conclusion: First observational constraints on T-duality modified cosmology highlight negligible effects at current precision. Future surveys may better probe quantum gravity corrections in late-time universe.

Abstract: We explore the cosmological consequences of a modified cosmology inspired by
string T-duality. We incorporate the zero-point length correction, $l_0$, into
the gravitational potential and derive the modified Friedmann equations via
thermodynamic approach at the apparent horizon of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) universe. The resulting framework introduces a dimensionless coupling
parameter $\beta\sim l_0^2H_0^2$ quantifying deviations from the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model. Using Bayesian inference with \textsc{Cobaya} and MCMC
sampling, we constrain the model parameter against late-time observations,
including PantheonPlus and Union3 Type~Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers,
DESI~DR2 BAO measurements, and Amati-calibrated GRBs. The joint analysis yields
an upper bound $\beta \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ (68\% C.L.), implying that
departures from $\Lambda$CDM are extremely small within current precision.
Model comparison through the Akaike Information Criterion shows that the
$\Lambda$CDM and T-duality models provide statistically equivalent fits to the
data, exhibiting only a marginal preference for $\Lambda$CDM. These results
provide the first quantitative observational constraints on string T-duality
inspired modified cosmology and underscore the potential of future
high-precision surveys to test quantum-gravity induced corrections in a
late-time universe.

### [88] [Schwarzschild Black Hole Coupled with a Cloud of Strings Immersed in King Dark Matter Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16260)
*Faizuddin Ahmed,Edilberto O. Silva*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the geodesic and thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild black hole with a cloud of strings (Letelier black hole) embedded in a King dark matter halo. The study uses the effective potential formalism to analyze particle dynamics and photon trajectories, explores topological features via Duan's φ-mapping theory, and examines thermodynamic effects like temperature, Gibbs free energy, and phase transitions. Key findings include shifts in vector field zero points, increased photon sphere radii, and decreased horizon radii with higher string cloud parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how King dark matter halos and string clouds influence the geometry, dynamics, and thermodynamics of black holes, providing insights into astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena such as black hole shadows, stability, and phase transitions.

Method: The effective potential formalism for analyzing particle geodesics, Duan's topological current φ-mapping theory to study photon ring topology, and thermodynamic analysis using Gibbs free energy and generalized Helmholtz free energy frameworks incorporating dark matter and string parameters.

Result: The KDM halo and string cloud modify photon sphere radii, ISCOs, black hole shadow structures, thermodynamic quantities (temperature, Gibbs free energy), and phase transitions. The string cloud parameter shifts vector field zero points and causes photon sphere expansion but horizon contraction.

Conclusion: The presence of KDM halos and string clouds significantly alters both the geometric/dynamical properties and thermodynamic behavior of black holes. These findings enhance our understanding of black hole physics in non-vacuum spacetimes and the role of exotic matter distributions in modifying general relativistic predictions.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the geodesic and thermodynamic properties of a
Schwarzschild black hole with a cloud of strings (known as the Letelier black
hole) immersed in a King dark matter (KDM) halo under an isotropic
configuration. The dynamics of both photons and massive particles are analyzed
in detail using the effective potential formalism, including particle
trajectories, the photon sphere, black hole shadow, and the innermost stable
circular orbits (ISCOs). Particular emphasis is placed on how the presence of
the KDM halo modifies these geometric and dynamical features. Furthermore, we
explore the topological characteristics of photon rings by constructing a
normalized vector field, following Duan\textquotesingle{}s topological current
$\phi$-mapping theory, and demonstrate how this field is influenced by both the
string cloud and the KDM halo. In the thermodynamic context, we analyze the
impact of the KDM halo and the string cloud on the Hawking temperature, Gibbs
free energy, thermal stability, and phase transitions of the black hole.
Finally, we examine the thermodynamic topology of the system using a
theoretical framework that incorporates a generalized Helmholtz free energy and
topological current theory. In both the photon sphere and thermodynamic
analyses, we show that the string cloud parameter shifts the location of the
zero point of the vector field in the equatorial plane. Specifically, in the
photon sphere case, the radius of the photon sphere increases with increasing
values of the string cloud parameter, while in the thermodynamic topology, the
horizon radius decreases as the string cloud parameter increases.

Abstract: Quantum effects are studied in both Schwarzschild spacetime and a spacetime
in which a null shell collapses to form a black hole via the vacuum
polarization $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ and stress-energy tensor $\langle T_{ab}
\rangle$ for a massless minimally-coupled scalar field in two dimensions. For
Schwarzschild spacetime, the Boulware, Unruh, and Hartle-Hawking states are
considered. For the collapsing null shell spacetime, the \textit{in} vacuum
state is used. Instabilities of the Unruh, Hartle-Hawking, and \textit{in}
states resulting from the behavior of $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ in the regions
inside and outside of the horizon are found. The question of how well the Unruh
state for the eternal black hole approximates quantum effects in the interior
of a black hole that forms from collapse is addressed.

Abstract: The dynamics of charged particles around magnetized black holes provide
valuable insights into astrophysical processes near compact objects. In this
work, we investigate the bound and unbound trajectories of charged particles in
the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external, uniform
magnetic field. By analyzing the effective potential and solving the
corresponding equations of motion, we classify the possible orbital
configurations and identify the critical parameters governing the transition
between stable and escape trajectories. The influence of the magnetic field
strength and particle charge on the orbital structure, energy, and angular
momentum is systematically explored. Applications of the obtained results are
discussed in the context of the S2 star orbiting Sagittarius A* and the motion
of bright hotspots detected near the event horizon, offering a potential
interpretation of recent observations in terms of magnetized dynamics. The
study contributes to a deeper understanding of charged-particle motion around
black holes and its relevance to high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the
galactic center.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper uses CUDA-accelerated numerical simulations to study the shadow features of rotating and charged black holes via Dunkl derivative formalism, deriving constraints on Dunkl parameters linked to Event Horizon Telescope observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the shadow aspects of new rotating and charged black hole solutions using advanced numerical methods and observational data from the EHT collaboration.

Method: 1. Developed a metric function incorporating Dunkl derivative formalism to model black hole properties.
2. Applied CUDA for high-performance simulations to analyze horizon radii and identify valid solution regions.
3. Used Hamilton-Jacobi approach to evaluate shadow aspects for rotating/non-rotaming cases.
4. Calculated emission energy rates based on shadow characteristics.
5. Implemented CUDA code to constrain Dunkl deformation parameters against EHT observational data.

Result: Established strict constraints on Dunkl deformation parameters through GPU-accelerated simulations, creating a bridge between theoretical Dunkl-modified black hole models and real shadow observations from EHT.

Conclusion: CUDA-optimized numerical methods effectively link Dunkl-deformed black hole shadow properties with observational astronomy, offering a new framework for testing quantum gravity-inspired models against empirical data.

Abstract: With the help of CUDA high-performance numerical codes exploited in machine
learning, we investigate the shadow aspect of new rotating and charged black
holes using the Dunkl derivative formalism. Precisely, we first establish the
corresponding metric function encoding the involved physical properties
including the optical character. Exploiting such accelerated simulations, we
approach the horizon radius behaviors in order to determine the regions of the
module space providing physical solutions. Applying the Hamilton-Jacobi
mechanism, we assess the shadow aspect for non-rotating and rotating solutions.
Using such an aspect, we evaluate the energy rate of emission. Developing a
high-performance CUDA numerical code, we derive strict constraints on the Dunkl
deformation parameters in order to establish a link with the shadow
observations provided by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration.

### [92] [Frame Dependence of Bound on Lyapunov Exponent in Dilatonic Reissner-Nordström-AdS and Kerr-Sen-AdS Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16479)
*Hocheol Lee,Bogeun Gwak*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how the Lyapunov exponent bound for charged particles in specific black hole spacetimes depends on the choice of gravitational frame (Einstein vs. string frame) in theories involving dilaton fields. It finds that while massless particles' Lyapunov exponents are frame-invariant, those for massive particles depend on the frame due to dilaton coupling. The chaos bound can be satisfied in one frame but violated in another depending on parameters, highlighting frame dependence in string-inspired gravity theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of conformal frame transformations on chaotic dynamics (via Lyapunov exponents) in curved spacetimes described by Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton and heterotic string theories. The study aims to clarify whether the maximum chaos bound (Lyapunov exponent limit) is frame-independent or sensitive to the choice of metric frame.

Method: Analytical and numerical analysis of charged particle motion in dilatonic Reissner-Nordström-AdS and Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes. The Lyapunov exponent calculations are performed in both Einstein and Jordan (string) frames, comparing results to assess frame dependence under conformal transformations in different gravity theories.

Result: For massless particles, the Lyapunov exponent remains unchanged between frames. However, massive particles show frame-dependent exponents due to dilaton coupling. The chaos bound (λ ≤ 2πT) is found to be frame-sensitive: it may hold in the Einstein frame but violate in the string frame for some parameters, and vice versa for other parameter choices.

Conclusion: The choice of conformal frame significantly affects the bounds on quantum chaos in black hole spacetimes, particularly when dilaton fields are present. These results suggest that frame selection impacts thermodynamic and dynamical properties in string-inspired gravity theories, implying the importance of considering frame transformations in theoretical models.

Abstract: We investigate the frame dependence of the Lyapunov exponent bound for
charged particles in dilatonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS and Kerr-Sen-AdS black
hole backgrounds, derived from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory and the
low-energy effective action of heterotic string theory, respectively. The
analysis is performed in both the Einstein and string (Jordan) frames to
examine the influence of conformal transformations on chaotic behavior. For
massless particles, the Lyapunov exponent remains invariant under frame
transformations, whereas for massive particles, it exhibits frame dependence
owing to coupling to the dilaton field. Our results indicate sensitivity of the
bound on chaos to the choice of frame. Depending on various parameters, the
bound can be satisfied in the Einstein frame and violated in the string frame,
while the opposite situation may occur for different parameter values.
Numerical computations corroborate the findings of our analysis and demonstrate
modifications in the chaotic behavior of string-inspired black holes induced by
the dilaton field and the choice of frame.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In default of a fundamental MOND theory -- a FUNDAMOND -- I advocate that,
alongside searching for one, we should try to identify predictions that follow
from wide classes of MOND theories, if not necessarily from all. In particular,
predictions that follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- ``primary
predictions'' -- are shared by all MOND theories, and are especially valuable.
Such predictions permit us to test the MOND paradigm itself, or at least large
parts of it, without yet having a FUNDAMOND. Concentrating on the deep-MOND
limit, I discuss examples of either type of predictions. For some examples of
primary predictions, I demonstrate how they follow from the basic tenets (which
I first formulate). I emphasize that even predictions that pertain to the
deep-MOND limit - namely, those that concern gravitating systems that have low
accelerations everywhere -- require the full set of MOND tenets, including the
existence of a Newtonian limit close to the deep-MOND regime. This is because
Newtonian dynamics is a unique theory that all MOND theories must tend to in
the limit of high accelerations, and it strongly constrains aspects of the
deep-MOND regime, if the transition between the limits is fast enough, which is
one of the MOND tenets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a geometric framework where dispersion relations are viewed as
parametric surfaces in energy-momentum space. Within this picture, the presence
and type of critical points of the surface emerge as clear geometric signatures
of kinematical restrictions. The Newtonian relation corresponds to a
developable surface with no critical points, reflecting the absence of
invariant limits. Special Relativity generates a saddle point and globally
negative curvature, encoding the universal light cone. Modified dispersion
relations may introduce additional critical points, signaling new invariant
energy scales or thresholds. This unifying approach not only recasts known
results in a transparent geometric language but also provides a simple
diagnostic tool for exploring departures from Lorentz invariance and their
physical implications.

TL;DR: This paper studies dark matter and dark energy perturbations in a non-canonical scalar field model with an exponential potential, analyzing cosmic evolution and structure formation through dynamical systems, perturbation frameworks, and spherical collapse models. It finds these models can explain both background expansion and structure growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how non-canonical scalar field models with exponential potentials can reconcile cosmic expansion dynamics with structure formation observations, addressing limitations of standard models.

Method: Used dynamical system analysis to find critical points in FLRW universe evolution, calculated cosmological parameters (Hubble, deceleration), applied pseudo-Newtonian formalism for linear perturbations, and spherical collapse model for non-linear structure formation.

Result: Derived f(z)σ₈(z) and halo mass functions showing non-canonical models effectively describe both background cosmic expansion and matter perturbation growth, aligning with observational data.

Conclusion: Non-canonical scalar field models provide a viable theoretical framework that explains cosmic acceleration and structure formation, offering new avenues for observational testing of dark energy dynamics.

Abstract: This paper examines the growth of dark matter and dark energy perturbations
within a non-canonical scalar field model characterized by an exponential
potential. Through dynamical system analysis, we identify critical points and
track the background evolution of a spatially flat FLRW universe dominated by
dark energy and pressureless dark matter. We systematically derive key
cosmological quantities, including the Hubble parameter, deceleration
parameter, density parameters, and the scalar field's equation of state, and
explore their dependence on model parameters. Within the linear perturbation
framework, employing the pseudo-Newtonian formalism, we compute the growth
factor of matter density perturbations. To investigate the non-linear regime of
structure formation, we employ the spherical collapse model and derive its key
parameters. Building on these findings, we compute the function
$f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ and the relative number density of halo objects exceeding a
given mass threshold. Our results indicate that non-canonical scalar field
models can effectively account for both background cosmic evolution and the
growth of structure, offering potential insights into observational constraints
and large-scale dynamics.

### [96] [Flux-Conservative BDNK Hydrodynamics and Shock Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16603)
*Nicolas Clarisse,Eduardo O. Pinho,Teerthal Patel,Fabio S. Bemfica,Mauricio Hippert,Jorge Noronha*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flux-conservative formulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics within the BDNK framework for conformal and nonconformal fluids at zero chemical potential. In 1+1D conformal case, numerical solutions show that BDNK equations prevent shock formation with smooth initial data that would form shocks in Euler equations, within the frame-robust regime defined by small Knudsen numbers. Robustness is confirmed via numerical convergence testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in previous formulations of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics, particularly oscillatory structures and frame dependence, while ensuring reliable shock analysis within BDNK's validity regime.

Method: Developed a first-order, flux-conservative BDNK formulation for viscous hydrodynamics. Conducted numerical simulations in 1+1D conformal fluids using two initial data classes, applying systematic convergence testing and shock indicators to evaluate solution robustness across hydrodynamic frames.

Result: The flux-conservative approach eliminates spurious oscillations in the frame-robust regime (small Knudsen numbers). Smooth initial data leading to Eulerian shocks instead form sharp features prevented by viscous BDNK effects. Numerical tests confirm solution reliability and frame robustness.

Conclusion: Viscous effects in BDNK can delay or prevent shock formation for certain smooth initial conditions, though shocks may still emerge under different data. The flux-conservative formulation offers a robust computational tool for exploring viscous relativistic hydrodynamics within BDNK's valid parameter range.

Abstract: We present a new, first-order, flux-conservative formulation of relativistic
viscous hydrodynamics in the BDNK framework, applicable to conformal and
nonconformal fluids at zero chemical potential. Focusing on the conformal case
in 1+1 dimensions, we numerically solve the equations of motion for two classes
of consistent initial data and assess the robustness of the resulting solutions
with respect to changing the hydrodynamic frame. Our flux-conservative
formulation does not exhibit spurious oscillatory structures within the regime
of validity of BDNK theory (the hydrodynamic-frame-robust regime),
corresponding to sufficiently small Knudsen numbers. Using this
flux-conservative approach, we numerically investigate the potential formation
of shocks and their fate in BDNK in 1+1D using smooth initial data known to
produce shocks in the relativistic Euler equations. For the type of initial
data we consider, we show that the sharp features formed in Euler are prevented
by the hyperbolic viscous BDNK equations. The prevention of shock formation we
observe occurs in the frame-robust regime of BDNK. This, however, does not
preclude the formation of shocks in BDNK for different smooth initial data. The
reliability of our results is supported by systematic numerical convergence
testing, which is used to assess shock indicators, simulation performance, and
the robustness of solutions for different hydrodynamic frames.

TL;DR: The paper explores how massive particles behave in strong gravitational fields using Kaluza-Klein theory and general relativity. It shows that under such conditions, particles can decay due to spacetime curvature making their effective mass imaginary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effects of strong gravitational fields on the dynamics of massive particles and the emergence of imaginary effective mass in curved spacetime.

Method: Deriving a modified dispersion relation within 5D Kaluza-Klein theory and general relativity, incorporating phase space curvature effects on particle mass.

Result: Effective mass of particles becomes imaginary in strong gravitational fields, leading to possible particle decay triggered by spacetime curvature.

Conclusion: Spacetime curvature in strong gravity regimes can induce particle decay through imaginary effective mass, suggesting new physics in extreme gravitational environments.

Abstract: We derive a modified dispersion relation for massive particles within the
frameworks of five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory and general relativity,
taking into account strong gravitational effects. The resulting effective mass
depends on the curvature of the underlying phase space. Notably, in regions
with strong gravitational fields, the effective mass may become imaginary,
implying the possibility of particle decay induced by spacetime curvature.

A robust controller design improves stability against parameter perturbations, validated through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for stabilizing laser frequency in space-based gravitational-wave detectors by ensuring the robustness of arm-locking control loops, which are vulnerable to parameter perturbations.

Method: Development of a parametric stability analysis framework using D-subdivision theory and Semi-Discretization method; design of a frequency-domain based robust controller.

Result: Theoretical analysis and time-domain simulations confirm the proposed controller maintains closed-loop stability and suppresses laser frequency noise even under parameter perturbations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies stability boundaries and the designed controller ensures robust performance, critical for accurate gravitational-wave measurements.

Abstract: Arm-locking frequency stabilization is a key technique for suppressing laser
frequency noise in space-based gravitational-wave detectors. The robustness of
the arm-locking control loop is crucial for maintaining laser frequency
stability, which directly impacts the accuracy of gravitational-wave
measurements. In this work, a parametric stability analysis framework is
developed by combining the D-subdivision theory with the Semi-Discretization
method to map the stability regions of arm-locking systems in the parameter
space and identify their critical stability boundaries. Based on the
frequency-domain characteristics, a robust arm-locking controller is designed
to enhance loop stability under parameter perturbations. Theoretical analysis
and time-domain simulations confirm that the proposed controller maintains
closed-loop stability and realize suppression of laser frequency noise against
parameter perturbation.

Abstract: We study electrically charged, slowly rotating black hole solutions in
Einstein-Bumblebee gravity coupled to the traceless (conformal) ModMax
nonlinear electrodynamics. By adopting a quadratic bumblebee potential that
fixes the vacuum expectation value of the Lorentz-violating vector, we derive
both the static configuration and its first-order rotating extension and
demonstrate how the bumblebee parameter $\ell$ and the ModMax deformation
$\gamma$ modify the horizon structure and the effective electric charge. We
further investigate the dynamical properties of this spacetime by considering a
massive scalar field perturbation. Using two independent numerical techniques,
we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and perform a comprehensive
analysis of the influence of all relevant parameters, including the black hole
spin, the Lorentz-violating coupling, the ModMax deformation, and the scalar
field mass. Our results reveal coherent trends in the QNM frequencies,
highlighting the interplay between Lorentz-symmetry breaking and nonlinear
electrodynamics effects in black hole dynamics.

Abstract: The angular distribution of gravitational-wave power from persistent sources
may exhibit anisotropies arising from the large-scale structure of the
Universe. This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and
cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave
emitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first
observing run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer
techniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband
persistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic
decomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent
gravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints
to date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity
estimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \times
10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted
sources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397
-- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\sim 1.1
\times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \times 10^{-24}$. For persistent broadband sources, we
constrain the gravitational-wave flux $F_{\alpha, \hat{n}}^{95\%,
\mathrm{UL}}(25\, \mathrm{Hz}) < (0.008 - 5.5) \times 10^{-8}\, \mathrm{erg\,
cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}\, Hz^{-1}}$, depending on the sky direction $\hat{n}$ and
spectral index $\alpha=0,\,2/3,\,3$. Finally, for extended sources, we place
upper limits on the strain angular power spectrum $C_\ell^{1/2} < (0.63 - 17)
\times 10^{-10} \,\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$.

### [101] [Exact Black Hole Solutions in Bumblebee Gravity with Lightlike or Spacelike VEVS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16731)
*Jia-Zhou Liu,Shan-Ping Wu,Shao-Wen Wei,Yu-Xiao Liu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores new Lorentz-violating black hole solutions in bumblebee gravity with two-component vector fields, showing distinct thermodynamic behaviors depending on the vacuum expectation value's nature (lightlike vs spacelike)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent progress in Lorentz-violating gravity theories motivates exploring black hole solutions in bumblebee gravity models with specific vector field configurations.

Method: Derived Schwarzschild-like, Schwarzschild-(A)dS, and charged black hole solutions within bumblebee gravity framework incorporating nonminimal electromagnetic coupling. Analyzed thermodynamic properties comparing entropy calculations.

Result: Found black holes retain Lorentz-violating corrections even in lightlike cases; entropy mismatch persists in spacelike cases but matches in lightlike scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates novel solutions extending previous work, highlighting differing thermodynamic outcomes based on vector field's vacuum expectation value type, suggesting deeper insights into Lorentz symmetry breaking in gravity.

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in Lorentz-violating theories of gravity, we
obtain new black hole solutions within the framework of bumblebee gravity where
the bumblebee vector field has two independent nonzero components and acquires
either a lightlike or spacelike vacuum expectation value. Within this
framework, we first derive new Schwarzschild-like and Schwarzschild-(A)dS black
hole solutions. We first obtain Schwarzschild-like and Schwarzschild-(A)dS-like
solutions in this framework. By further introducing a nonminimally coupled
electromagnetic field, we obtain new charged black hole solutions. These
solutions extend previous results through the inclusion of additional
Lorentz-violating parameters. Remarkably, we find that even for lightlike
vacuum expectation values, the black hole solutions retain corrections arising
from the Lorentz-violating parameter. Furthermore, we present a preliminary
analysis of the thermodynamic properties associated with these new solutions.
Similar to previous studies that reported a mismatch between the black hole
entropy and the Wald entropy in bumblebee gravity with spacelike vacuum
expectation values, our solutions with spacelike vacuum expectation values
exhibit the same behavior. However, we find that the two entropies coincide in
the lightlike case considered here.

Abstract: TianQin is a proposed space-based mission for gravitational wave detection,
employing a constellation of three drag-free satellites in high Earth orbits to
form a laser interferometric observatory. A critical technical challenge is
mitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the
third dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise
is unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites,
movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be
subtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay
interferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients
can be estimated from the null TDI channel $\zeta$ and used for noise
subtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA
yaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of
realistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC)
are yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations
to generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration
capability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more
favorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the
accuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency
data (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve
estimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such
as $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case
of high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different
sinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These
methods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the
TTL noise subtraction.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper extends the locally defined Carroll symmetry of gravitational waves to a global one, using translations and boosts from Sturm-Liouville solutions, and demonstrates the Displacement Memory Effect with the Pöschl-Teller profile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and globalize the Carroll symmetry observed in gravitational waves, allowing for a more comprehensive description of their dynamics and associated effects like the Displacement Memory Effect.

Method: Utilizes solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation to define global translations and Carroll boosts, analyzing their implications on trajectories and momentum. The Pöschl-Teller potential is used as a specific example to illustrate theoretical findings.

Result: Identifies that specific parameter choices lead to trajectories with zero momentum, tied to the Displacement Memory Effect. The global Carroll symmetry framework successfully extends local observations and provides a structured analysis through the chosen profile.

Conclusion: The extension of Carroll symmetry to a global context offers a robust theoretical framework for studying gravitational wave dynamics and related memory effects, validated by the Pöschl-Teller example.

Abstract: The locally defined Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave is extended to a
globally defined one. Translations and Carroll boosts, associated with two
independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us
to describe the motions. The Displacement Memory Effect arises for particular
choices of the parameters which yield trajectories with zero momentum. We
illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic method to assess how artifacts like glitches and gaps in LISA data affect transient gravitational wave signals. It models both artifacts and signals as Poisson processes with dead times, uses a Normal approximation to estimate contamination probabilities, and validates this with simulations. The method helps evaluate LISA's observational impacts efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of data artifacts on LISA's detection of transient gravitational waves, enabling evaluation of different instrumental scenarios.

Method: Models artifacts and signals as independent Poisson processes. Uses dead time to characterize contamination, applies Normal approximation for probability distributions of total contamination time and signal contamination. Validated via simulations.

Result: Demonstrated that the Normal approximation aligns with simulation results, showing the method's validity. Provides a rapid tool to assess contamination effects.

Conclusion: The approach offers a fast, efficient way to evaluate how glitches and gaps impact LISA science, serving as a valuable figure of merit for instrumental planning.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework to quantify the impact of artefacts
(glitches and gaps) in LISA data on transient gravitational wave signals. By
modeling both artefacts and transient signals as independent Poisson processes,
and characterising the contaminating effect of an artefact by an associated
dead time, we estimate the probability distribution of the total contamination
time during the observation period using a Normal approximation under various
contamination scenarios. Using the same approach, we also estimate the
probability that a population of transient signals contaminates each other. We
demonstrate the validity of the Normal approximation by comparing it to the
numerical distribution obtained via simulations. Our approach provides a rapid
means to assess the potential impact of glitches and gaps on LISA science, and
can be used as a figure of merit to evaluate different instrumental scenarios.

*Yuxin Yang,Changfu Shi,Yi-Ming Hu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Evidence for nonlinear gravitational effects in GW250114's ringdown signal is found by favoring a model with a nonlinear quasi-normal mode (220Q) over the standard linear model (440 mode). This improves consistency with numerical relativity and offers a new way to study strong-field gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether nonlinear effects, specifically the 220Q mode predicted by general relativity, contribute to the ringdown phase of gravitational wave events, beyond the standard linear approximation.

Method: The study uses Bayesian inference to analyze the post-merger oscillations of GW250114. Models incorporating the nonlinear 220Q mode were compared against standard linear models (440 mode) using Bayes factors to assess statistical preference.

Result: Models with the 220Q mode had higher Bayes factors and produced remnant black hole parameters (mass and spin) more consistent with numerical relativity simulations, indicating significant nonlinear contributions.

Conclusion: Nonlinear mode coupling is significant in the ringdown phase, providing a new method to probe strong-field gravity beyond linear approximations.

Abstract: We report evidence for nonlinear gravitational effects in the ringdown signal
of gravitational wave event GW250114. Using Bayesian inference, we find that
the inclusion of a nonlinear quasi-normal mode (220Q), a second-order harmonic
predicted by general relativity, is statistically favored over the standard
linear model (440 mode) when analyzing the post-merger oscillations.
Specifically, models incorporating the 220Q mode yield higher Bayes factors
than those including only the linear 440 mode, and produce remnant black hole
parameters (mass and spin) more consistent with full numerical relativity
simulations. This suggests that nonlinear mode coupling contributes
significantly to the ringdown phase, opening a new avenue to probe strong-field
gravity beyond linear approximations.

Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in theoretical physics, especially Noether
symmetry, which is a powerful approach for identifying the models at the
fundamental level. The exact solution is provided within the point-like
Lagrangian framework. In this work, we study one of the alternative theories of
gravity based on the non-metricity scalar $Q$, namely $f(Q)$ gravity, via
Noether symmetry. We utilize Noether symmetry within the framework of $f(Q)$
gravity to derive the functional expression for $f(Q)$, which is given by
$f(Q)=c(Q-nQ)^{\frac{3}{2-2n}}$. To confirm the exact solution of the model
through Noether symmetry, we continue to consider the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology with the dynamical solution of the
system using dimensionless variables and show that the accelerated expansion of
the universe follows a power law scale factor. In the following, we show that
the quantities corresponding to the exact solution for $n<1$ lead to an
accelerated expansion universe. Finally, in the framework of $f(Q)$
scalar-tensor cosmology, we apply the Noether symmetry approach to find the
cosmological models consistent with the Noether symmetry.

TL;DR: The paper examines static, spherically symmetric compact objects in symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor gravity, extending Brans-Dicke and scalar-tensor models. It uses conservation laws derived from variational symmetries to reconstruct black-hole solutions and confirms viable astrophysical objects matching extremal Reissner-Nordström exteriors in GR limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore nontrivial solutions in symmetric teleparallel gravity frameworks beyond General Relativity, particularly for compact objects, and validate the theory's viability through astrophysical object existence.

Method: Analyzes field equations using minisuperspace approach and variational symmetries to derive conservation laws, enabling analytic black hole solution reconstruction. Matches interior solutions with extremal Reissner-Nordström exteriors.

Result: Successfully reconstructed analytic black-hole solutions and demonstrated existence of viable compact objects within the theory, consistent with GR in specific limits.

Conclusion: Symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor gravity supports realistic astrophysical compact objects, proving its validity as a competitive gravitational theory framework.

Abstract: We investigate the existence of static, spherically symmetric compact objects
within the framework of symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor gravity. This
theory extends the Brans-Dicke and scalar-tensor models within the symmetric
teleparallel formalism. We consider a nontrivial connection that allows for
genuinely nontrivial solutions in the limit of General Relativity. The field
equations admit a minisuperspace description and by applying the method of
variational symmetries we construct the corresponding conservation laws in
vacuum. The application of these conservation laws enables the reconstruction
of analytic black-hole solutions. Finally, we study the interior structure of
compact objects matched to an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m exterior and show
that the symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor theory supports the existence of
viable astrophysical objects.

### [108] [Gertsenshtein effect on the spacetime curved by background magnetic field with geometric optics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17094)
*Ryutaro Tomomatsu,Teruaki Suyama,Paolo Gondolo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates how spacetime curvature from a background magnetic field affects the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, which describes wave conversion between electromagnetic and gravitational waves. It finds competing effects of curvature-induced focusing (amplification) and wave conversion (attenuation), with no net amplitude change in plane waves and attenuation in spherical waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing studies of the Gertsenshtein effect typically ignore the spacetime curvature caused by the magnetic field itself. This work aims to address this limitation by incorporating curvature effects to gain a more accurate understanding of wave conversion dynamics in realistic scenarios.

Method: The authors derived second-order metric perturbations around Minkowski spacetime under cylindrical symmetry, handled gauge ambiguities and boundary conditions, then applied geometric optics to obtain coupled wave equations. Solutions were analyzed for plane and spherical wave cases to compare curvature focusing vs. conversion effects.

Result: For plane waves, curvature's focusing effect cancels conversion losses, leaving amplitude unchanged. For spherical waves, wave conversion (attenuation) overpowers focusing, resulting in net amplitude reduction. This reveals curvature's non-trivial role depending on wave geometry.

Conclusion: Spacetime curvature significantly modifies the inverse Gertsenshtein effect's behavior depending on wave configuration, showing geometric factors must be considered for accurate predictions in strong magnetic field environments (e.g., pulsars, black hole magnetospheres).

Abstract: When electromagnetic (or gravitational) waves propagate in the presence of a
background magnetic field, a portion of the waves converts into gravitational
(or electromagnetic) waves. This phenomenon, known as the (inverse)
Gertsenshtein effect, is typically analyzed in Minkowski spacetime, neglecting
the spacetime curvature induced by the magnetic field itself. This paper
investigates, for the first time, the influence of spacetime curvature on the
(inverse) Gertsenshtein effect. To this end, we first determine the metric
perturbation from Minkowski spacetime up to second order in the magnetic field
strength, assuming cylindrical symmetry. We also discuss the ambiguities in the
form of the metric perturbation arising from gauge freedom and boundary
conditions. Using the geometric optics approximation, we then derive a set of
coupled equations governing the propagation of electromagnetic and
gravitational waves in the resulting curved spacetime. These equations are
solved for two specific scenarios: a plane wave and a spherical wave. From the
solutions, we compute the evolution of the wave amplitudes and the associated
energy fluxes. Our analysis reveals that two competing effects govern the
amplitude evolution: magnification due to the focusing of waves by spacetime
curvature, and attenuation due to wave conversion via the Gertsenshtein effect.
In the plane wave case, these effects precisely cancel, resulting in no net
change in amplitude. In contrast, for the spherical wave, the Gertsenshtein
effect dominates over focusing, leading to an overall reduction in amplitude.

*Hodek M. García,Marcelo Salgado*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates two scenarios using non-linear $f(R)$ gravity: solar system tests recovering chameleon effects and neutron star studies with a quadratic $f(R)$ model. The same formalism is applied, with adjusted constants and EOS. A polytropic EOS for neutron stars improves numerical accuracy and is validated against 2.35 $M_igodot$ pulsar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how $f(R)$ gravity models, compatible with cosmological constraints, perform in solar system and strong gravity regimes like neutron stars without linear approximations, thus providing precise predictions for phenomena where general relativity alone may be insufficient.

Method: 1. Full non-linear $f(R)$ gravity equations applied to static, spherically symmetric spacetimes for solar system and neutron star scenarios.
2. For solar system: Re-examining chameleon mechanisms without equation linearization in cosmologically viable models.
3. For neutron stars: First use of a multi-algebraic polytropic equation of state in $f(R)$ gravity, avoiding tabulated EOS interpolation. 
4. Numerical solutions shared between both scenarios using consistent techniques.

Result: 1. Solar system results show chameleon effects can emerge naturally under non-linear treatment without requiring approximations.
2. Neutron star analysis validates model against 2.35 $M_igodot$ data, revealing significant modifications in spacetime geometry compared to GR for certain parameter choices.
3. Polyropic EOS implementation shows superior numerical stability and accuracy compared to traditional tabulated approaches.

Conclusion: Non-linear $f(R)$ gravity can simultaneously satisfy cosmological and solar system constraints while offering new insights into strong-field regimes like neutron stars. The shared formalism proves versatile across vastly different scales, though model constraints must carefully balance cosmological and astrophysical requirements. The successful treatment of massive neutron stars suggests $f(R)$ models may extend beyond current GR confirmations in ultra-dense matter conditions.

Abstract: By implementing a full non-linear treatment of $f(R)$ gravity in static and
spherically symmetric spacetimes, we analyze two scenarios. The first one
within the context of the solar-system tests where we try to recover the
chameleon effects without any approximations in the equations (e.g.
linearization) from $f(R)$ models that are compatible with cosmology. The
second scenario deals with a quadratic $f(R)$ model that is tested in neutron
stars. This scenario, which is associated with strong gravity, is completely
independent from the first one, but exploits the fact that the equations and
formalism are basically the same in both applications. The difference between
the two goals lies mainly in the values of the constants involved in the
specific $f(R)$ models and the equation of state (EOS) of the central object
(Sun or neutron star), but the numerical techniques and the general form of the
field equations remain valid in both situations. For the neutron star problem
we employ for the first time and in the context of $f(R)$ gravity a multiple
algebraic polytropic EOS that mimics accurately realistic EOS in several
density ranges. By doing so we avoid the numerical interpolation needed when a
realistic EOS is given in tabulated form. Furthermore, we compare our results
with the latest data, which includes the most massive neutron star known to
date of about $2.35 M_\odot$ from PSRJ0952-0607.

Abstract: Strongly lensed gravitational waves may pass through the stellar field of a
lensing galaxy with additional modulations (on both phase and amplitude) due to
gravitational microlensing effect of stars/remnants near the line of sight.
These microlensed waveforms depend on the mass and location of thousands or
more most relevant stars, so that their deterministic reconstruction from the
data is computationally prohibitive. We classify the detection and parameter
estimation of such events as non-deterministic inference problem and propose a
solution with the implementation of normalizing flows. As a first step, we show
that $8\%$ of microlensed events can be detected with significance $\ge 3
\sigma$ in the third generation era, with the chosen microlensing parameters
correlated with the density of the underlying stellar field. This approach
opens the door to probing microlensing effects and the properties of the
underlying stellar fields. A similar construction may also be applied to other
non-deterministic inference problems, such as detecting post-merger
gravitational waves from binary neutron star coalescence and signals from
core-collapse supernovae.

### [111] [The spacetime geodesy of perfect fluid spheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17159)
*Christopher Simmonds,Matt Visser*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'spacetime geodesy' as a method focusing on symmetries and geometrical features over dynamical equations, useful when equations are uncertain. It applies this to examples like spatially isotropic Ricci tensors and spherical-symmetric Weyl tensor analysis to explore physics implications and 'complexity'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where dynamical equations are uncertain or unknown, the paper advocates a geometrical approach (spacetime geodesy) that leverages symmetries and geometry first, delaying engagement with specific equations of motion. This parallels Weinberg's cosmography concept for FLRW spacetimes.

Method: The method involves using 'spacetime geodesy' to prioritize symmetries and geometrical structures over explicit dynamical equations. Key examples include enforcing spatially isotropic Ricci tensors to imply perfect fluid conditions without an equation of state, and analyzing Weyl tensor properties in spherical symmetry under different conditions to assess 'complexity'.

Result: The paper demonstrates how spacetime geodesy can derive physical conditions (e.g., perfect fluid without specifying equation of state) and connect geometric elements (Weyl tensor) to concepts like complexity. It shows the approach's utility in reducing reliance on uncertain dynamics.

Conclusion: Spacetime geodesy provides a versatile framework to explore gravitational systems when dynamics are unclear, highlighting the value of geometric and symmetry-based reasoning. This approach broadens the understanding of spacetime structures and their implications in cosmology and astrophysics.

Abstract: Herein we argue for the utility of "spacetime geodesy", a point of view where
one delays as long as possible worrying about dynamical equations, in favour of
the maximal utilization of both symmetries and geometrical features. This
closely parallels Weinberg's distinction between "cosmography'' and
"cosmology'', wherein maximal utilization of both the symmetries and
geometrical features of FLRW spacetimes is emphasized. This "spacetime
geodesy'' point of view is particularly useful in those situations where, for
one reason or another, the dynamical equations of motion are either uncertain
or completely unknown. Several examples are discussed -- we shall illustrate
what can be done by considering the physics implications of demanding spatially
isotropic Ricci tensors as a way of automatically implementing the (isotropic)
perfect fluid condition, without committing to a specific equation of state. We
also consider the structure of the Weyl tensor in spherical symmetry, with and
without the (isotropic) perfect fluid condition, and relate this to the notion
of "complexity''.

TL;DR: This paper investigates static dark energy stars in Rastall-Rainbow gravity.
They modify TOV equations with an energy-dependent spacetime,
find parameter effects on star mass/radius,
and validate with pulsar/GW data.
Results show viable stable configurations within theoretical limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative gravity theories (R-R gravity)
that allow for dark energy star stability
while matching astrophysical observations like GW events and pulsar masses.

Method: 1. Derived modified R-R field equations
2. Reformed stellar structure equations with TOV modification
3. Used modified Chaplygin EoS for matter distribution
4. Solved numerically to analyze mass-radius relations
5. Compared with GR and observational data from GW170817/GW190814

Result: - R-R parameters affect maximum mass, radii, and stiffness
- Stable causal configurations possible with certain parameters
- Deviations from GR lead to systematic structural changes
- Observational benchmarks are satisfied within valid parameter ranges

Conclusion: Rastall-Rainbow gravity supports observationally consistent dark energy stars.
Offers verifiable signatures in strong gravity regimes,
providing testable predictions for future gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate static configurations of dark energy stars
within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow (R-R) gravity, which combines an
energy-dependent deformation of spacetime with a nonminimal coupling between
matter and geometry. We begin by deriving the modified field equations
corresponding to R-R gravity and subsequently reformulate the stellar structure
equations to describe hydrostatic equilibrium. The generalized
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations are then solved numerically by
adopting the modified Chaplygin equation of state to model the interior matter
distribution. The R-R parameters, along with fluid constants, are shown to
influence the maximum mass, radii, and stiffness of the star sequences compared
to the baseline set by general relativity. We apply observational benchmarks
from high-mass pulsars and binary-merger events (e.g., GW170817 and GW190814)
to appraise viability within the explored parameter space. The results
collectively suggest that stable, causal configurations arise from physically
meaningful parameter selections, with deviations from general relativity
leading to systematic changes in structural characteristics while adhering to
theoretical limits. These findings illustrate that Rastall-Rainbow gravity can
support stable, observationally consistent dark energy stars, providing
verifiable signatures in strong gravitational fields.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect up to
thousands of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). These sources will spend
$\sim 10^5$ cycles in band, and are therefore sensitive to tiny changes in the
general-relativistic dynamics, potentially induced by astrophysical
environments or modifications of general relativity (GR). Previous studies have
shown that these effects can be highly degenerate for a single source. However,
it may be possible to distinguish between them at the population level, because
environmental effects should impact only a fraction of the sources, while
modifications of GR would affect all. We therefore introduce a population-based
hierarchical framework to disentangle the two hypotheses. Using simulated EMRI
populations, we perform tests of the null vacuum-GR hypothesis and two
alternative beyond-vacuum-GR hypotheses, namely migration torques
(environmental effects) and time-varying $G$ (modified gravity). We find that
with as few as $\approx 20$ detected sources, our framework can statistically
distinguish between these three hypotheses, and even indicate if both
environmental and modified gravity effects are simultaneously present in the
population. Our framework can be applied to other models of beyond-vacuum-GR
effects available in the literature.

*Souradeep Pal*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates the measurable effective inspiral spin in detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave data, finding that non-zero effective spins may be systematically inferred even in non-spinning systems at low signal strengths, suggesting true spin values might generally be small.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether the observed correlation between effective spin and signal loudness indicates real astrophysical trends or is an artifact of measurement limitations, aiming to improve population studies and astrophysical inferences.

Method: Analysis of gravitational-wave transient catalog data and simulations to test spin inference accuracy under varying signal strengths.

Result: Observed correlation shows louder events have near-zero spins while fainter ones show arbitrary spins; simulations confirm non-spinning systems can produce false non-zero spin measurements at low signal strengths.

Conclusion: The apparent effective spins in catalog data may not reflect true astrophysical values, suggesting most observable binaries have small spins; future detections with higher sensitivity are needed for accurate population studies.

Abstract: We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable
compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from
the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence
of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an
apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the
loudness of the gravitational-wave events-- loud events typically have
close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with
relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning
systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the
possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact
binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on
the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.

TL;DR: The paper investigates a Dark Energy model dependent on Hubble parameter derivatives, derives key cosmological parameters under power-law scale factor assumptions, examines 9 interacting scenarios, and correlates the model with scalar field theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore novel DE models incorporating Hubble parameter dynamics to better explain cosmic acceleration and interaction mechanisms between DE and matter.

Method: The method involves using a power-law scale factor (a ∝ tⁿ) to derive cosmological quantities like energy densities, EoS, etc., for both non-interacting and interacting (with nine H or density-dependent interaction terms Q) cases, then mapping the model to scalar field frameworks.

Result: Results include derived expressions for cosmological parameters under different interaction terms, demonstrating model viability, and showing correspondence with scalar field theories such as k-essence and DBI. The model aligns with current cosmological observations.

Conclusion: The model effectively describes DE dynamics with Hubble derivatives, validates through interaction scenarios, and establishes links to fundamental scalar field theories, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding cosmic expansion.

Abstract: In this work, we study a Dark Energy (DE) energy density model which depends
on the Hubble parameter squared $H^2$ and on its first, second and third time
derivatives $\dot{H}$, $\ddot{H}$ and $\dddot{H}$. Considering a scale factor
$a$ with a power-law dependence on the time (with $n$ indicating the power-law
index), we obtain some important cosmological quantities as function of the ,
like the energy densities of Matter $\rho_m$ and of DE $\rho_D$, the fractional
energy densities of DM $\Omega_m$ and of DE $\Omega_D$, the Hubble parameter
squared $H^2$, the deceleration parameter $q$, the evolutionary form of the
fractional energy density of DE $\Omega'_D$, the pressure of DE $p_D$ and the
Equation of State (EoS) parameter of DE $\omega_D$, for both non interacting
and interacting cases. For the interacting case, we consider 9 different
interacting term $Q$, all functions of the Hubble parameter $H$ and/or of
$\rho_m$ and $\rho_D$. Finally, we establish a correspondence between the DE
model we study and some scalar field theories, including tachyon, k-essence,

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study investigates how the symmetry energy parameter L_sym affects observables in binary neutron star mergers through numerical simulations. While gravitational waves couldn't distinguish L_sym variations, ejecta composition and r-process yields showed significant differences, suggesting electromagnetic observations as a potential diagnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify observable signatures of the symmetry energy's slope (L_sym) in binary neutron star mergers, particularly through gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals.

Method: Performed numerical-relativity simulations using equations of state parameterized by varying L_sym while keeping Q_sat constant. Analyzed gravitational wave emissions, ejecta composition, and r-process nucleosynthesis outcomes.

Result: Simulations showed no clear gravitational wave distinction between L_sym values, but ejecta composition changes led to distinct r-process yields (especially for A < 120). Thermal effects influenced tidal deformability, aligning with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Electromagnetic counterparts (like kilonovae) may reveal L_sym's role through ejecta properties, though complexities in linking them directly to symmetry energy remain.

Abstract: We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary
neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope
of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of
equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density
functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of
$L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a
set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of
state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with
subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related
structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with
theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves
are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we
find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations,
which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our
extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find
that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower
mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts
are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm
sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the
ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.

Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics constitutes a fundamental principle of
physics, precluding the existence of perpetual motion machines and providing a
natural definition of the arrow of time. Its scope extends across virtually all
areas of physical theory. Nonetheless, certain systems are known to admit
negative absolute temperatures under well-defined conditions, a phenomenon that
has been experimentally observed. In this work, we formulate an
\textit{extended} version of the first and second laws, which recovers the
conventional statement for positive temperatures and extends its applicability
to the negative-temperature domain. Illustrative examples are discussed in the
contexts of quantum cosmology and Onsager's vortices.

### [118] [Exorcising ghosts with gravitational waves: cases of ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17789)
*Gaetano Lambiase,Shinji Mukohyama,Tanmay Kumar Poddar,Anna Chiara Rescigno*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates fourth-order gravity theories, both ghostful and ghost-free, by analyzing gravitational wave (GW) emission. Ghostful theories face theoretical and observational issues, leading to a mass constraint m ≳ 10^-11 eV. Ghost-free theories avoid these problems, with GW data imposing mass-dependent upper bounds on coupling constants α₁ and α₂.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe ultraviolet physics beyond General Relativity using fourth-order curvature extensions and address their theoretical inconsistencies (ghosts/non-unitarity) through observational tests with GW data.

Method: Computed GW emission for both ghostful and ghost-free theories, comparing orbital-period decay in binary pulsars (PSR B1913+16, PSR J1738+0333) and GW170817's chirp-mass evolution with theoretical predictions.

Result: Ghostful theories fail to recover GR's quadrupole formula in the massless limit, yielding m ≳ 10^-11 eV. Ghost-free theories successfully reproduce GR results, with coupling constants constrained as α₁₂ ≲ 4.2×10^83 (for m~3×10^-16 eV) and α₁₂ ≲1.3×10^75 (for m~10^-11 eV).

Conclusion: GW observations provide first astrophysical-scale constraints on fourth-order gravity theories: ghostful models are strongly disfavored, while ghost-free variants require their coupling constants to satisfy mass-dependent upper limits.

Abstract: General Relativity (GR) is an effective field theory valid in the infrared
regime. Quadratic curvature extensions intended to probe ultraviolet physics
generically propagate a massive spin-$2$ ghost and are therefore non-unitary.
One route to remove ghost is by enlarging the geometric sector (torsion,
non-metricity). We investigate the infrared phenomenology of both the standard
(ghostful) and ghost-free fourth-order gravity theories by computing
Gravitational Wave (GW) emission and confronting the results with observations
such as the orbital-period decay of quasi-stable binaries such as PSR B1913+16
and PSR J1738+0333 and the chirp-mass evolution of GW170817. In the ghostful
theory, besides the theoretical inconsistency due to non-unitarity, there are
also phenomenological problems: the massless spin-$2$ GW flux cancels the
combined GW fluxes of the massive spin-$2$ ghost and massive spin-$0$ scalar in
the vanishing-mass limit, so the GR quadrupole formula is not recovered at the
leading order. As a result, we obtain the GW constraint on the ghostful theory
as $m\gtrsim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{eV}$, where $m$ is the mass of the massive modes.
By contrast, the ghost-free theory smoothly reproduces the Newtonian potential
and GR quadrupole formulae when the two coupling constants $\alpha_1$ and
$\alpha_2$ vanish, independently of the mass $m$. Therefore, GW observations
put mass-dependent upper bounds on the size of the coupling constants. For
example, if we assume $\alpha_1\simeq\alpha_2$ for simplicity, then we obtain
$\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 4.2\times 10^{83}$ for $m\sim 3\times
10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 1.3\times 10^{75}$ for $m\sim
10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}$. To our knowledge, these are the first
astrophysical-scale bounds reported for ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order
gravity.

Abstract: Understanding gravity is at the heart of some of the biggest questions in
modern physics. While General Relativity (GR) is a theoretically unique and
experimentally well-tested framework, it remains important to question whether
it accurately describes gravity at all scales, motivating the exploration of
broader theories. Black holes (BHs) provide ideal natural laboratories for
testing gravity in the strong-field regime, and the recent advent of
gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new observational window into
these extreme environments. In particular, the final stage of a compact binary
merger$\unicode{x2013}$the ringdown phase$\unicode{x2013}$is of great interest.
Here, the study of quasinormal modes (QNMs) offers a powerful tool to probe the
fundamental nature of gravity and to extract intrinsic properties of BHs.
  This thesis investigates BH solutions and their QNM spectra within
scalar-tensor theories of gravity$\unicode{x2013}$well-motivated extensions of
GR that include an additional scalar degree of freedom. In particular, it
focuses on stealth BHs, where scalar hair exists without altering the
background metric but can modify the QNM spectrum. By analysing perturbations
around such spacetimes, we derive forecasted constraints on beyond-GR
parameters for current and future GW detectors.
  Three main investigations are presented: (i) a novel method to constrain the
speed of gravity using ringdown signals alone; (ii) a stability and QNM
analysis of BHs with linearly time-dependent scalar hair; and (iii) a general
classification of stealth solutions in higher-order scalar-tensor (HOST)
theories, including a stability analysis and identification of ringdown
observational signatures. Together, these studies contribute new theoretical
tools and observational forecasts that advance our understanding on fundamental
gravitational physics in the era of GW astronomy

*Christiane K. M. Klein*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the Unruh state for a free scalar quantum field on Kerr-de Sitter spacetime under mode stability assumptions. It extends previous proofs of the Hadamard property to all subextreme black hole spins within a cosmological constant range and applies this state to numerically study inner horizon quantum effects, highlighting their universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the Hadamard property of the Unruh state across broader black hole parameters and explore quantum phenomena at inner horizons through numerical methods.

Method: Extends geometric analysis of the trapped set from Kerr to Kerr-de Sitter spacetime, leveraging prior works and mode stability assumptions.

Result: Generalization of Hadamard property proof to all subextreme spins and demonstration of universality in quantum effects at inner horizons through numerical studies.

Conclusion: The Unruh state's Hadamard property holds for wide black hole parameters, enabling reliable study of inner horizon quantum behaviors which exhibit universal characteristics.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Unruh state for a free scalar quantum field on
Kerr-de Sitter under the assumption of mode stability. We summarise the proof
of its Hadamard property that was previously given in [Klein:2023] for
sufficiently small black-hole rotation and cosmological constant and show how
it can be generalised to any subextreme black-hole angular momentum in the same
range of the cosmological constant. This is done by extending a geometric
analysis of the trapped set of the Kerr spacetime [H\"afner, Klein:2024] to
Kerr-de Sitter. Moreover, we discuss the application of this state in the
numerical study of quantum effects at the inner horizon [Klein, Soltani,
Casals, Hollands:2024], and describe a universality result for these effects
[Hintz, Klein: 2024].

### [121] [Photon decaying in de Sitter universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17631)
*Y. Ahmadi,M. V. Takook*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates the three-photon interaction in de Sitter spacetime, focusing on the half harmonic generator scenario where one photon splits into two equal-energy photons. It derives scattering matrix elements to explore indirect gravitational effects on quantum field theory and compares the null curvature limit with Minkowski space results. The Hamiltonian in Minkowski spacetime is obtained using one-loop quantum vacuum fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how gravitational effects in curved spacetime (de Sitter) influence quantum field interactions, specifically three-photon processes, and to compare these effects with flat spacetime (Minkowski) predictions. This comparison helps validate theories of quantum gravity and curvature's role in particle interactions.

Method: The study uses the de Sitter ambient space formalism to analyze three-photon interactions. It focuses on the 'half harmonic generator' scenario (a photon decaying into two same-energy photons). Scattering matrix elements are calculated to quantify gravitational effects. The null curvature limit (approaching Minkowski spacetime) is analyzed for comparison. The Minkowski Hamiltonian is derived via one-loop quantum vacuum fluctuations.

Result: Scattering matrix elements for three-photon interactions in de Sitter spacetime were derived. The null curvature limit matched Minkowski space results, confirming consistency. The Hamiltonian in Minkowski spacetime, computed through vacuum fluctuations, provides a basis for comparing curved vs flat spacetime effects on quantum interactions.

Conclusion: Gravitational effects in de Sitter spacetime modify three-photon interactions, with the null curvature limit aligning with Minkowski predictions. This underscores the role of spacetime curvature in quantum phenomena and validates the ambient space formalism's applicability to explore quantum-gravity interfaces.

Abstract: The interaction between three photons is studied in de Sitter ambient space
formalism. As a special case the half harmonic generator is considered, {\it
i.e.} one photon decays to two same-energy photons. The scattering matrix
elements are presented which define the indirect gravitational effect on
quantum field theory. The null curvature limit of scattering matrix is obtained
for comparing it with its Minkowskian counterpart. The Hamiltonian of this
interaction, in Minkowski space-time, was presented by using the quantum vacuum
fluctuation in the one-loop approximation.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the quantization of scalar-tensor gravity using loop quantum gravity techniques, leading to a discrete time evolution and resolution of the big bang singularity via a quantum bounce in Brans-Dicke cosmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address singularity problems in scalar-tensor gravity and cosmology by applying non-perturbative quantization methods.

Method: Deparametrization of the Hamiltonian constraint using a scalar field as 'time', followed by loop quantum gravity quantization leading to discrete time evolution.

Result: Obtained physical solutions showing a quantum bounce replaces the classical big bang singularity in Brans-Dicke cosmology.

Conclusion: Non-perturbative quantization methods successfully resolve the big bang singularity, supporting viability of loop quantum gravity approaches in scalar-tensor theories.

Abstract: The degree of freedom of the scalar field in scalar-tensor gravity is
employed as 'time' to deparametrize the Hamiltonian constraint of the theory.
The deparametrized system is then non-perturbatively quantized by the approach
of loop quantum gravity. This results in a discrete time evolution of the
physical states with respect to the gravitational degree of freedom in the
quantum theory. In the corresponding Brans-Dicke cosmological model, the
physical solutions to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint is obtained in the
light of the deparametrization. The quantum dynamics indicates that the
classical big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce.

### [123] [Einstein gravity extended by a scale covariant scalar field with Bekenstein term and dynamical mass generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17704)
*Erhard Scholz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalar-tensor model within integrable Weyl geometry that replicates MOND-like dynamics in weak gravitational fields through specific terms in the Lagrangian, addressing issues like dark matter without requiring additional components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain gravitational dynamics in galaxies and clusters without dark matter by modifying gravity through a scalar field model that exhibits MOND characteristics in the weak field limit.

Method: A Lagrangian model in integrable Weyl geometry incorporating a Bekenstein-type quadratic term and a second-order mass term for the scalar field. These terms activate when the scalar field's gradient is spacelike and below a MONDian threshold, similar to the Berezhiani/Khoury superfluid model. The model is analyzed in the Einstein frame, focusing on light cone modifications and weak-field approximations.

Result: The model produces MOND-like acceleration laws in the Newton-Milgrom limit and compatible gravitational lensing effects. It suggests that the external field effect in MOND must be re-evaluated, potentially explaining galaxy cluster dynamics without dark matter.

Conclusion: The scalar-tensor framework with specified terms in Weyl geometry successfully mimics MOND dynamics, offering an alternative to dark matter in hierarchical systems and requiring reassessment of MOND's external field considerations.

Abstract: Under carefully chosen assumptions a single general relativistic scalar field
is able to induce MOND-like dynamics in the weak field approximation of the
Einstein frame (gauge) and to modify the light cone structure accordingly. This
is shown by a Lagrangian model formulated in the framework of integrable Weyl
geometry. It contains a Bekenstein-type (``aquadratic'') term and a second
order term generating additional mass energy for the scalar field. Both are
switched on only if the gradient of the scalar field is spacelike and below a
MOND-typical threshold, like in the superfluid model of Berezhiani/Khoury. The
mass term induces non-negligible energy and pressures of the scalar field and
leads to gravitational light deflection compatible with MOND-ian free fall
trajectories. In the weak field (Newton-Milgrom) approximation the Bekenstein
term implies a deep MOND equation for the scalar field. In this model the
external field effect of the MOND approach has to be reconsidered. This has
important consequences for hierarchical systems like clusters, which may
suffice for explaining their dynamics without additional dark matter.

### [124] [Phantom scalar field with arbitrary potential: accelerating scaling attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17765)
*Sudip Halder,Supriya Pan,Paulo M. Sá,Tapan Saha*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the dynamics of phantom scalar fields with arbitrary potentials in both uncoupled and coupled cosmological models, showing that coupled models can support accelerated scaling solutions addressing cosmic coincidence, though current cosmic acceleration lacks a sufficient matter-dominated precursor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether coupled dark energy models can provide accelerating scaling solutions and alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem, motivated by warm inflationary paradigm for the interaction between phantom dark energy and dark matter.

Method: Autonomous system formulation and stability analysis via dynamical systems methods, considering both constant and variable dissipation coefficients in coupled scenarios.

Result: Uncoupled models lack accelerated scaling solutions, but coupled models with either constant or variable dissipation coefficients do support such solutions. However, the observed accelerated expansion isn't preceded by a sufficiently long matter-dominated era.

Conclusion: Coupled phantom dark energy models offer potential solutions to the cosmic coincidence problem through scaling dynamics, though they require further refinement to match observational timelines of cosmic eras.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the dynamics of a phantom scalar field with
an arbitrary potential, focusing on accelerating scaling solutions of
cosmological relevance. We consider both uncoupled and coupled cosmological
scenarios. In the latter case, the coupling between phantom dark energy and
dark matter is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm, with the
dissipation coefficient assumed to be either constant or variable. The
evolution equations of our coupled and uncoupled cosmological models are
written in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using
methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the
only requirement imposed on the phantom scalar-field potential is that a
specific dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its
derivative, must be invertible. We show that the uncoupled phantom cosmological
model cannot accommodate any accelerated scaling solution, while such solutions
do exist in the coupled scenario, for both constant and variable dissipation
coefficients. Although there is a limitation to these scaling solutions $-$
specifically, the current stage of accelerated expansion is not preceded by a
long enough matter-dominated era $-$ our results show that the existence of a
direct coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter yields great
potential for addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.

### [125] [Comprehensive analysis of time-domain overlapping gravitational wave transients: A Lensing Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17787)
*Nishkal Rao,Anuj Mishra,Apratim Ganguly,Anupreeta More*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how overlapping signals from binary black-hole mergers in future GW detectors can be mistaken for gravitational lensing events, particularly Type-II strong lensing. Simulations show that systems with similar chirp masses, overlapping close in time, and comparable signal strengths are prone to false lensing identification. The study highlights the need for caution in interpreting lensing claims as detector sensitivities improve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the potential for overlapping GW signals to mimic gravitational lensing effects, which could lead to misinterpretation of data from next-generation GW detectors. The authors aim to quantify how such overlaps introduce biases into parameter estimation and create false lensing signatures.

Method: The authors simulate quasicircular binary black-hole systems with varying chirp-mass ratios (0.5, 1, 2), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ratios (0.5, 1), and coalescence-time offsets (-0.1 to 0.1 seconds). They use Bayesian parameter estimation and fitting-factor analyses to compare scenarios of overlapping signals against gravitational lensing hypotheses (Type-II lensing and microlensing).

Result: Key results include Bayesian evidence favoring lensing only when chirp-mass ratios are ≥1 and time delays ≤0.03 seconds. Microlensing-like signals can arise from overlaps because timing differences mimic lens-induced delays. False identifications are most likely when systems have similar chirp masses, similar SNRs, and small time separations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that overlapping signals, especially those with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness, pose a significant risk of being falsely identified as gravitational lensing events. This problem will increase with improved detector sensitivity, necessitating refined analysis methods to distinguish overlaps from actual lensing.

Abstract: Next-generation GW detectors will produce a high rate of temporally
overlapping signals from unrelated compact binary coalescences. Such overlaps
can bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical
effects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how
overlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on
two scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated
point-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with
chirp-mass ratios $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1,\,2\}$,
SNR ratios $\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm B}/\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1\}$, and
coalescence-time offsets $\Delta t_{\rm c}\in[-0.1,\,0.1]~\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian
PE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is
favored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\log_{10}\mathscr{B}^{\rm
L}_{\rm U}>1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with
$\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\gtrsim1$ and $|\Delta t_{\rm
c}|\leq0.03~\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can
arise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two
superimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|$.
Overall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios,
relative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs
of the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping
black-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are
likely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected
to become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study
focuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds,
the findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories.
