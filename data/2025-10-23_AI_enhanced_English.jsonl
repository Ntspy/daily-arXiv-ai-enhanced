Using simulations the study tracks how sudden\naccretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop)\nduring which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains\nnearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition\nbetween two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion,\nand how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that\nboosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest\neffect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the\nregion of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance.

Since an\n$X_{\\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this\nimplies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF\nshape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\\rm max}$ dependence can be explained\nin terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes\nwith $(1/\\rho)^J$, where $\\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\\rm max}$ and $J$ is\na zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density\nscaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other\nscaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\\rm max}$ to the\ncore at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper\nshowers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to\nlarger measured electric fields as $X_{\\rm max}$ increases. The picture at\nhigher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the\ndeflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time\ndelays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.\nThis loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic\nfield and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission\nwith decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF\namplitude dependence on $X_{\\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly\ninfer, even bypassing any $X_{\\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary\ncomposition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions\non other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\\rm\nmax}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
