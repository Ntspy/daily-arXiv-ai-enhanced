Cosmic ray (CR) electrons\nare likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large\ndiffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively\nunmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy\n($E_{\\rm max}$)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand,\nrecent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be\nsuppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating\nplasma-scale magnetic structures, or \"micromirrors,\" that efficiently scatter\nCRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement\nfor shock acceleration in the ICM.

Here, we\nintroduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly\nDetection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find\nnovelties.\n  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different\ngeometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance\nmetrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score\nthat is not reliant on any single definition of distance.

By\nadopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different\napproaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced\nparticle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible\nthermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor\nformulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle\ncreation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that\nirreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration\nthrough a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the\ncosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second\nlaw of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon\nand enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter\nphase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics.\nFurthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of\nmatter creation processes.

The former are expected to follow the cosmic star\nformation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR.\nHowever, this division has come under question in several ways, the most\nprominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at\nlow redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in\narXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift\nLGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are\ncompact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift\nLGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers.\nMost results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than\n200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use\na larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has\nincreased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we\nadd a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning\n(ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985).

To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric,\nnon-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation\nbetween luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us\nto use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the\nluminosity function.

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star passes within the tidal\nradius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). In TDEs it is expected that the\norbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the\nSMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk\nprecessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this\npaper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such\nTDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous\nsuper-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the\ndisk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray\nradiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer\nand the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1)\nThe smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The\ndimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to\nmoderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions\ntake turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the\nX-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other\ntwice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one\ncycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray\nand optical emissions.

This provides\nphysical meaning and a natural explanation to the Gibbons-Hawking entropy -- it\nis the entropy in the volume $V_H$ bounded by the cosmological horizon. Here we\nconsider whether the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture remains valid for the de Sitter\nstate in general $d+1$ spacetime. To do this, we use local de Sitter\nthermodynamics, characterized by a local temperature $T=H/\\pi$. This\ntemperature is not related to the horizon: it is the temperature of local\nactivation processes, such as the ionization of an atom in the de Sitter\nenvironment, which occur deep within the cosmological horizon. This local\ntemperature is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\\rm GH}=H/2\\pi$. Two\ndifferent ways of calculations of the entropy of the Hubble volume were\nconsidered: integration of the local entropy density over the Hubble volume and\nthe first law of the de Sitter thermodynamics. In both cases we found that the\nentropy of the Hubble volume is $S_H=(d-1)A/8G$, which modifies the\nGibbons-Hawking entropy of horizon.

A precise understanding of the composition\nand phase behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is crucial for\nuncovering the fundamental laws of the strong interaction. This study\ninvestigates hadron-quark hybrid stars using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\n(NJL) model. As an effective theory, this model can describe the generation of\ndynamical quark masses and chiral symmetry restoration characteristic of dense\nquark matter.\n  We construct the hybrid EOS by joining the BSR6 relativistic mean-field model\nfor hadronic matter with the NJL model for quark matter. A quintic polynomial\ninterpolation ensures a smooth ($C^2$ continuity) and thermodynamically\nconsistent crossover between the phases. Based on this hybrid EOS, we solve the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to calculate macroscopic properties\nof neutron stars, such as the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationship and the tidal\ndeformability parameter ($\\Lambda$).\n  By exploring key model parameters, we identify a region satisfying a wide\nrange of multi-messenger constraints. Our resulting EOS supports a maximum mass\nconsistent with PSR J0740+6620, while simultaneously predicting radii and tidal\ndeformabilities for a $1.4M_{\\odot}$ star that agree with NICER observations\nand limits from GW170817. This work thus presents a self-consistent model that\nresolves the tension between high-mass pulsars and small tidal deformabilities,\ndeepening our understanding of the hadron-quark crossover."}

This additional term plays a crucial role\nin resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible\nat extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we\nfind that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark\nmatter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics,\nthe maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD\nmodel can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed\n2.14 $M_{\\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if\nwe further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4\n$M_{\\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the\nmaximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no\nmore than 2.08 $M_{\\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact\nobject with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event,\ncannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model."}
