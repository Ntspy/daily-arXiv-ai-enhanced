We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion.

In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances.

In this framework, the dynamical description of a relativistic fluid requires a new macroscopic variable, the spin density, which is associated with a spin tensor. This tensor, defined as the expectation value of a rank-3 tensor operator in quantum field theory, contributes to the system's total angular momentum. The need for such a theory is motivated by recent measurements of spin polarization of hadrons produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n  Two distinct formulation methods are employed. The first is grounded in covariant thermodynamics and extends the conventional Navier-Stokes and M\u00fcller-Israel-Stewart theories of relativistic hydrodynamics by incorporating a spin tensor. The second is based on principles of relativistic quantum statistical mechanics, building upon and generalizing the foundational Zubarev approach. Both formulations aim to construct a closed system of evolution equations for the macroscopic variables and, via an entropy-current analysis, to identify the dissipative currents and their associated transport coefficients.\n  These two approaches provide different perspectives for future applications focused on spin polarization measurements. Beyond its phenomenological relevance, the theory also opens several avenues for further theoretical developments.

In the presence of a Chern--Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity.
