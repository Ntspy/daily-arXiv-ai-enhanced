Submitted to The European Physical Journal C", "summary": "Tidal forces acting on orbiting bodies arise from inhomogeneities in the\ngravitational field, generating stresses that can deform or even disrupt these\nobjects. In this work, we analyze relativistic tidal forces associated with\nultracompact objects described by static and spherically symmetric spacetimes,\nfocusing on observers in circular geodesic motion. We show that, in contrast to\nthe case of radial geodesics, tidal forces diverge as the orbit approaches null\ncircular geodesics. As illustrative examples, we study two uniform-density\nstellar models: one isotropic and another supported purely by tangential\nstresses. We conjecture that the divergence of tidal forces near light rings\nmay play a role in the nonlinear stability of ultracompact, horizonless\nobjects."}

A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation\ncollaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor\nconstellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates\n(BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the\nfrequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among\ndifferent missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current\nrequirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a\ncustomized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty,\nnamed \"BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and\nSummary Tools\" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated,\nsemi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of\nprompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while\nmaintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of\nBREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST\nalso aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes\nthrough rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge\nbetween prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a\nsuite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly\nthe specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on\nprompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been\ndemonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a\nsignificant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the\nfuture."}
