Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy.

Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines.

In order to assess the complementary role of a 60 m starshade for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), we develop the optical model of a starshade and simulate solar system imaging at 0 degrees and 60 degrees inclinations. The optical core throughput of a direct-imaging system is a key metric that governs exposure time and the potential exoplanetary yield of a mission. We use our optical model to evaluate core throughput, incorporating 6 m segmented and obscured telescope apertures, over the visible to near-infrared wavelength band (500-1000 nm). Accurate diffractive optical simulations of this form require many large Fourier transforms, with prohibitive run-times, as both the starshade mask and telescope aperture require fine-scale spatial sampling. We introduce a Fourier sampling technique, the Bluestein Fast Fourier Transform (BFFT), to efficiently simulate diffractive optics and enable high-fidelity simulations of core throughput. By characterizing sampling requirements and comparing BFFT's computational complexity to standard Fourier methods (for example, DFT and FFT), we demonstrate its efficiency in our optical pipeline.

D. von Fellenberg et al. (2025a, Paper I) reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/MRS observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and therefore the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Galactic Center extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index $\u03b1_{\\rm{MIR}}=0.45\\pm0.01_{\\rm{stat}}\\pm0.08_{\\rm{sys}}$ during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states ($\u03b1_{\\rm{NIR}}\\approx0.5$).

We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare's beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution's transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the SMA millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall clockwise-oriented Stokes Q--U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event.

We find no indication of dust extinction that could plausibly explain the UV deficit. The lower level of UV flux is reminiscent of the absorption seen in lower-luminosity events like SN\\,2017dwh, where Fe-group elements are responsible for the effect. However, in the case of SN\\,2023taz, there is no evidence for a larger amount of Fe-group elements which could contribute to line blanketing.

The most likely explanation is enhanced absorption by intermediate-mass elements, challenging previous findings that SLSNe exhibit similar UV absorption line equivalent widths.

We present a method framework to address the model dependence problem, especially to solve the problem of energy spectrum distortion caused by instrument signal pile-up due to high counting rate and high-rate effects, applicable to X-ray, gamma-ray, and particle detectors.

The inversion employs a Convolutional Neural Network, selected for its numerical stability and effective handling of complex detector responses. Validation using simulations across diverse input spectra demonstrates high fidelity.

This critique has prompted an ongoing debate over how to distinguish substantive general covariance from mere formal general covariance. Some proposals for defining substantive general covariance are based on the requirement that a theory be derivable from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. The present work aims to critically assess these proposals by examining canonical examples of Kretschmannian formulations of special relativistic theories. It will be shown that these formulations -- which seem merely formally generally covariant -- can always be derived from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. Although these actions involve auxiliary variables, these variables are trivial in the sense that they are either pure gauge or dynamically fixed by the other variables. Consequently, the theories described by these actions are arguably equivalent to the original Kretschmannian formulations. This stands in contrast to the actions proposed by Rosen and Sorkin, which include non-trivial auxiliary variables and hence seem to describe distinct physical theories.
