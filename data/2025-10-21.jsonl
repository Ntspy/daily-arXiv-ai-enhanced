Comments are welcome!", "summary": "The Georgi-Glashow model is the simplest possible attempt at grand\nunification. However, due to its particle content, it preserves a global\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, where $B$ and $L$ are baryon and lepton numbers,\nrespectively. It thus leaves neutrinos massless just as in the Standard Model.\nExtensions of the Georgi-Glashow model that break lepton number by two units,\ni.e., scenarios with $|\\Delta L|=2$ operator(s), naturally generate potentially\nviable Majorana neutrino masses. Consequently, $B-L$ breaking via the same\ndynamics that yields $|\\Delta L| = 2$ interactions unavoidably induces $|\\Delta\nB| = 2$ transitions, leading to intriguing processes such as\nneutron-antineutron ($n$-$\\overline{n}$) oscillation. We demonstrate this\nintrinsic connection between neutrino mass generation and $n$-$\\overline{n}$\noscillation within tree-level seesaw mechanisms of the Type I, II, and III\nvarieties, as well as in the one-loop and two-loop radiative neutrino mass\nmodels. Our study exhausts the simplest possible extensions of the\nGeorgi-Glashow model that yield realistic neutrino masses and mixing parameters\nand, in the process, induce $n$-$\\overline{n}$ oscillation."}

Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the\nintrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range\n1{\\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over\ninclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use\naccretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the\nunobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV\ngap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range (~1-400)\nacross different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray\nluminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of\nthese intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is\ndivided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly\ndifferent values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher\nEddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity\nand accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes\nroughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact\njets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This\nsuggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio\nluminosity in the younger jets. Our results provide physically motivated\nbolometric corrections for powerful radio quasars that are applicable to\npowerful radio-loud quasars at any epoch."}

However, the rarity of transient\nevents and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples\npose significant challenges in constructing training datasets for RB\nclassification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques,\nwhich inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising\nsolution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point\nsource injection strategies and their effects on classification performance\nwithin a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct\nvarious training datasets based on Random Injection (RI), Near Galaxy Injection\n(NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope\nNetwork datasets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on\nsimulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced datasets from\ngravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive\nexperimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus\nfiltering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g.,\nsupernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near\ngalaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a\nhigh false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these\ntrade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate.\nOur results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in\ndeveloping robust RB classifiers for transient (or multi-messenger) follow-up\ncampaigns."}

However, the\nprecise metallicity threshold (if it is a hard threshold) above which the\nformation of LGRBs is suppressed is still a topic of discussion. We\ninvestigated observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies to\nconstrain this metallicity dependence. In order to compute LGRB rates we\nmodelled the cosmic history of star formation, as a function of host galaxy\nmetallicity and stellar mass, and added a LGRB efficiency function that can\ninclude various shapes including abrupt cutoffs and more gradual variations in\nthe GRB yield with metallicity. In contrast to previous work, this model\nincludes scatters in the relations between mass, metallicity, and star\nformation rate, as well as a scatter in the metallicity distribution inside\ngalaxies. We then varied both the threshold value and shape, and compared it to\nobserved LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies. In our model a sharp\ncutoff at an oxygen abundance $Z_{\\text{O/H}}=12+\\log(\\text{O/H})=8.6\\pm0.1$\n(corresponding to $\\sim0.6Z_{\\odot}$) provides the best explanation for the\nobserved LGRB data.

Here\nwe propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable\nclassification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality\nreduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the\nspectral running $r$ and spectral index $\\gamma$ as the most critical\nparameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the\nCHIME/FRB sample. In the $\\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy\nregions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in\nflatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation.

Moreover, simple explosion models are often used in the literature, which\ncan introduce large errors in the assumed explosion energy and mass cut. In\nthis paper, our goal is to analyze the explosion properties and nucleosynthesis\nof a large range of progenitors from three different stellar evolution codes:\nFRANEC, KEPLER, and MESA. In particular, we will show the differences between\nthe neutrino-driven explosions simulated in this work with the much simpler\nbomb and piston models that are typically widely used in the literature. We\nwill then focus on the impact of different explodabilities and different\nexplosion dynamics on the nucleosynthetic yields. We adopt the neutrino-driven\ncore-collapse supernova explosion code GR1D+, i.e. a spherically symmetric\nmodel with state-of-the-art microphysics and neutrino transport and a\ntime-dependent mixing-length model for neutrino-driven convection. We carry out\nexplosions up to several seconds after bounce, and then calculate the\nnucleosynthetic yields with the post-processing code SkyNet. We find that our\n1D+ simulations yield explosion energies and remnant masses in agreement with\nobservations of type II-P, IIb, and Ib supernovae, as well as with the most\nrecent 3D simulations of the explosion. We provide a complete set of yields for\nall the stars simulated, including rotating, low-metallicity, and binary\nprogenitors.

II. Broadband Correlations", "comment": "12+4 pages, 10+2 figures. Accepted by ApJ. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "The physical origin of soft X-ray excess (SE) is a long lasting question,\nwith two prevailing theories -- ``warm corona'' and ``ionized reflection'' --\ndominating the discussion. In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from\nupscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV\nemission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the\nillumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily\ncorrelate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of\nthe series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a\nsample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \\citet{Chen+2025a}. Our\nextensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV\nthat remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\\mathrm{null}\\lesssim\n10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still\nstatistically significant ($p_\\mathrm{null}\\lesssim 5\\times 10^{-2}$). These\nfindings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome\nof the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is\nessential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally,\nwe report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index\n($\\Gamma_\\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential\ncompetition between the warm and hot coronae. Finally, we find that the\n$\\Gamma_\\mathrm{PC}$ values we derived with SE properly incorporated exhibit a\nmuch weaker correlation with $\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ ($p_\\mathrm{null}=2\\times\n10^{-2}$) than previously reported in the literature. This highlights the\ncritical role of accurately modeling SE in studies of the\n$\\Gamma_\\mathrm{PC}$--$\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ relation."}

This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and\ncosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave\nemitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first\nobserving run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer\ntechniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband\npersistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic\ndecomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent\ngravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints\nto date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity\nestimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \\times\n10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted\nsources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397\n-- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\\sim 1.1\n\\times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \\times 10^{-24}$.

Despite numerous\nstudies searching for their origin, it is still not known which source\npopulations emit them. A few confident individual associations exist with\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN), mostly with blazars which are jetted AGN whose\njet points in our direction. Nonetheless, on a population level,\nblazar-neutrino correlation strengths are rather weak. This could mean that\nblazars as a population do not emit HE neutrinos, or that the detection power\nof the tests is insufficient due to the strong atmospheric neutrino background.\nBy assuming an increase in HE neutrino emission during major blazar flares, in\nour previous studies we leveraged the arrival time of the neutrinos to boost\nthe detection power. In this paper we utilize the same principle while\nsubstantially increasing the number of blazars. We search for the\nspatio-temporal correlation of 356 IceCube HE neutrinos with major optical\nflares of 3225 radio- and 3814 $\\gamma$-ray-selected blazars. We find that,\ndespite the increase in data size, the number of confident spatio-temporal\nassociations remains low and the overall correlation strengths weak. Two\nindividual associations drive our strongest and the only $>$2$\\sigma$\npost-trial spatio-temporal correlation, occurring with the BL Lac objects of\nthe radio-selected blazar sample. We estimate that $\\lesssim$8\\% of the\ndetected cosmic neutrinos were emitted by blazars during major optical flares.\nAs a complementary analysis, we compare the synchrotron peak frequency,\nredshift, Doppler factor, X-ray brightness, and optical variability of\nspatially neutrino-associated blazars to those of the general blazar\npopulation. We find that spatially neutrino-associated blazars of the tested\nsamples have higher than average Doppler factor and X-ray brightness."}

Rather than\ntransforming to impact-parameter space, we remain in k and embed a normalized\nintegrand s(x, k; Q) whose auto-convolution produces the observed qT spectra.\nThe extraction proceeds in two steps. Stage I learns the structure kernel S(qT\n, x1, x2; QM ) by regressing the cross-section with known kinematic prefactors\nand charge-weighted PDF combinations factored out; experimental and PDF\nuncertainties are propagated with Monte Carlo replicas.

Applied to\nFermilab cross-section data from experiments E288 and E605, the method\nreproduces the measured qT spectra across Q and yields x and Q dependent TMDs\nthat broaden with Q, with uncertainty bands that consistently propagate\nexperimental, PDF, algorithmic and methodological components.

A critical technical challenge is\nmitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the\nthird dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise\nis unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites,\nmovable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be\nsubtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay\ninterferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients\ncan be estimated from the null TDI channel $\\zeta$ and used for noise\nsubtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA\nyaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of\nrealistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC)\nare yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations\nto generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration\ncapability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more\nfavorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the\naccuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency\ndata (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve\nestimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such\nas $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case\nof high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different\nsinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These\nmethods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the\nTTL noise subtraction."}

No new pulsars were detected for any of the 80 targets, which\ninclude some unidentified TeV sources that could be pulsar wind nebulae.

We explore the selection effects that precluded discoveries by testing\nthe parameters of the survey iteratively against many simulated populations of\nyoung pulsars in supernova remnants. For the synthetic pulsars that were\nundetected, we find evidence that, after beaming effects are accounted for,\nabout 45 per cent of pulsars are too faint, 30 per cent are too smeared by\nscattering, and a further 25 per cent have a modelled projected location which\nplaces them outside their supernova remnant. The simulations are repeated for\nthe S1 subband of the MeerKAT S-band receivers, resulting in a 50-150 per cent\nincrease in the number of discoveries compared to L-band depending on the flux\ndensity limit achieved. Therefore, higher frequency searches that can also\nachieve improved flux density limits are the best hope for future targeted\nsearches.

This motivates directional searches for astrophysical and\ncosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, as well as continuous-wave\nemitters. We present results of such a search using data from the first\nobserving run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer\ntechniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband\npersistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic\ndecomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent\ngravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints\nto date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity\nestimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \\times\n10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted\nsources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397\n-- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\\sim 1.1\n\\times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \\times 10^{-24}$.

In the $\\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy\nregions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in\nflatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We\nfurther construct an empirical probability map in the $\\gamma$-$r$ space,\nshowing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\\sim 65\\%$ in the\nhigh-repetition region to $\\sim 5\\%$ in the low-repetition region.

These sources were all identified via a single pulse search. Most of\nthem are likely to be rotating radio transients (RRATs) given their low pulse\nrates. Using data captured in our transient buffer we have localised nine\nsources in the image domain to arcsecond precision.

A critical technical challenge is\nmitigating tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise, which is expected to be the\nthird dominant noise source after laser frequency and clock noises. This noise\nis unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites,\nmovable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be\nsubtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay\ninterferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients\ncan be estimated from the null TDI channel $\\zeta$ and used for noise\nsubtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA\nyaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of\nrealistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC)\nare yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations\nto generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration\ncapability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more\nfavorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the\naccuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency\ndata (0.1 - 1 Hz). Moreover, we propose two other methods to further improve\nestimation accuracy. Firstly, using different null channel combinations, such\nas $C_3^{14}$, enhances the least squares estimation accuracy even in the case\nof high correlations in MOSAs' yaw jitters. Secondly, injecting different\nsinusoidal artificial maneuvers to the six MOSAs also shows improvements. These\nmethods can help TianQin to meet the 0.3 pm/Hz$^{1/2}$ requirement after the\nTTL noise subtraction."}

To achieve this goal, we employ a set of\nequations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density\nfunctional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of\n$L_{\\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a\nset of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of\nstate at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with\nsubsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related\nstructural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with\ntheoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves\nare unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we\nfind that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations,\nwhich employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our\nextracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find\nthat they are distinct for the different $L_{\\rm sym}$, especially at lower\nmass numbers $A \\lesssim 120$.

One such type of variability study, called reverberation\nmapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,\nwhich demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the\naccretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a\ncorresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the\nsurrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

Through simulations, we demonstrate that\nnon-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning\nsystems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the\npossibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact\nbinaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on\nthe understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences."}

Such overlaps\ncan bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical\neffects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how\noverlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on\ntwo scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated\npoint-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with\nchirp-mass ratios $\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm B}/\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm A}\\in\\{0.5,\\,1,\\,2\\}$,\nSNR ratios $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\rm B}/\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\rm A}\\in\\{0.5,\\,1\\}$, and\ncoalescence-time offsets $\\Delta t_{\\rm c}\\in[-0.1,\\,0.1]~\\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian\nPE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is\nfavored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\\log_{10}\\mathscr{B}^{\\rm\nL}_{\\rm U}>1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with\n$\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm B}/\\mathscr{M}_{\\rm A}\\gtrsim1$ and $|\\Delta t_{\\rm\nc}|\\leq0.03~\\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can\narise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two\nsuperimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\\Delta t_{\\rm c}|$.\nOverall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios,\nrelative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs\nof the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping\nblack-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are\nlikely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected\nto become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study\nfocuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds,\nthe findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories."}

Here\nwe propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable\nclassification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality\nreduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the\nspectral running $r$ and spectral index $\\gamma$ as the most critical\nparameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the\nCHIME/FRB sample. In the $\\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy\nregions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in\nflatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We\nfurther construct an empirical probability map in the $\\gamma$-$r$ space,\nshowing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\\sim 65\\%$ in the\nhigh-repetition region to $\\sim 5\\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining\nthis with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several\napparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending\nthem as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a\nsimple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB\nsample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling\nFRB origins."}

Specifically, we assume that the\nnon-minimally coupled Higgs field controls the inflationary era, we find the\nreheating temperature for the Higgs inflationary model and we demonstrate that\nthe Higgs effective potential exhibits a very weak first order phase\ntransition. This weak first order phase transition is an indication that the\nelectroweak phase transition may not actually proceed as a first order phase\ntransition, but it will proceed as a crossover or second order phase\ntransition. This second order phase transition proceeds with the Higgs field\nslow-rolling its potential toward to its new minimum. This slow-rolling may\ndeform the radiation domination total equation of state, and the aim of this\nwork is to pinpoint the observational imprints of this total equation of state\ndeformation on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves, that\naffects modes that enter the horizon at temperatures $T\\sim 150\\,$GeV or lower."}

Here we present a thorough comparison of the accuracy and\ncomputational cost of the Fisher Matrix, Derivative Approximation for\nLikelihoods (DALI) and traditional MCMC methods. We find that using DALI, which\nextends the traditional Fisher Matrix (FM) method to higher orders, allows for\na good approximation of the posterior with a $55$ times smaller computational\ncost, and that the cost-benefit of the doublet-DALI is better than that of the\ntriplet-DALI. We also show that the singlet-DALI, a hybrid MCMC-Fisher method,\nis much more accurate than the traditional FM and 10 times faster than the\ndoublet-DALI. A large effort has been invested in forecasting the science case\nof different detector configurations, and the ability of making fast yet\naccurate estimations of the posteriors is an important step forward.
