### [1] [Studying hard probe dynamics in QGP using effective field theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13942)
*Andreas Kirchner,Berndt Mueller,Jyotirmoy Roy,Chathuranga Sirimanna*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops an effective field theory framework to study heavy quark interactions in a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, focusing on phonon-mediated processes like decay and scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze heavy quark dynamics in QGP using an effective field theory approach, leveraging the fluid dynamics description of QGP as a non-dissipative colorless fluid.

Method: Derivatively coupled effective field theory combining heavy quarks with a relativistic fluid model of QGP. Calculations include decay widths and scattering amplitudes involving phonons in a thermal medium.

Result: Derived expressions for the decay width of heavy quark to phonon and phonon-heavy quark scattering cross sections, providing insights into energy loss mechanisms in QGP.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic method to study heavy quark-phonon interactions in QGP, with potential applications to understanding particle interactions in extreme astrophysical environments.

Abstract: An effective field theory framework is developed to study the interaction of
heavy quarks in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The latter is
treated as a relativistic non-dissipative colorless fluid which can be studied
using a derivatively coupled effective field theory based on previous work.
Coupling this to heavy quarks provides systematic way to obtain the interaction
between the heavy quark and phonons, excitations of the fluid. In particular we
calculate the decay width of heavy quark to phonon and phonon-heavy quark
scattering in a thermal medium.

### [2] [Probing Quadratically Coupled Ultralight Dark Matter with Pulsar Timing Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13945)
*Xucheng Gan,Hyungjin Kim,Andrea Mitridate*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study explores how ultralight dark matter with quadratic couplings to Standard Model particles affects pulsar timing array (PTA) observations, analyzing both coherent and stochastic signals. Current PTA sensitivity matches or surpasses other detection methods for coherent signals but underperforms for stochastic signals compared to equivalence principle tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of PTA observations in detecting ultralight dark matter interactions, considering both coherent and stochastic signals, and compare their sensitivity with existing and future experiments.

Method: Characterized signals from quadratic dark matter interactions, incorporating dark matter propagation in finite-density media. Analyzed current and upcoming PTA data sets to evaluate detection potential.

Result: For coherent signals, PTA sensitivity rivals or exceeds equivalence principle tests and atomic clocks. Stochastic signals, however, show PTA underperformance compared to equivalence principle constraints across existing and future data.

Conclusion: PTA observations are a competitive tool for detecting coherent signals from ultralight dark matter but less effective for stochastic signals. Future PTA advancements may still contribute meaningfully to dark matter research.

Abstract: Ultralight dark matter may couple quadratically to Standard Model particles.
Such quadratic interactions give rise to both coherent and stochastic signals
in pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. In this work, we characterize these
signals, including the effects of dark matter propagation in a finite-density
medium, and assess the sensitivity of current and upcoming PTA observations to
their detection. For coherent signals, we find that the sensitivity of current
PTA observations competes with and sometimes exceeds that of other probes, such
as equivalence principle tests and atomic clocks. For stochastic signals, we
find that PTA sensitivities underperform equivalence principle constraints for
both existing and upcoming PTA data sets.

### [3] [Large Neutrino "Collider"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13948)
*Yang Bai,Keping Xie,Bei Zhou*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large neutrino telescopes as 'Large Neutrino Colliders' (LνCs) to explore TeV-scale physics beyond the Standard Model by leveraging high-energy cosmic neutrino interactions, achieving center-of-mass energies beyond the LHC's 14 TeV limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the energy limitations of particle colliders like the LHC and explore new physics at TeV scales using naturally occurring high-energy neutrinos interacting with detector nuclei.

Method: Estimate mass-scale sensitivities for new physics scenarios using predicted and measured neutrino fluxes from IceCube and KM3NeT detectors at 1-30 km³ scales, analyzing collisions of PeV-scale cosmic neutrinos with nucleons.

Result: LνCs can probe multi-TeV particles with sensitivities comparable to or surpassing the LHC, offering a novel non-collider approach to high-energy physics exploration.

Conclusion: Large neutrino telescopes provide a unique platform to access energy regimes beyond current colliders, potentially uncovering beyond-Standard-Model physics through cosmic neutrino-nucleon collisions.

Abstract: We propose using current and future large-volume neutrino telescopes as
``Large Neutrino Colliders" (L$\nu$Cs) to explore TeV-scale physics beyond the
Standard Model. Cosmic neutrinos with energies above 100 PeV colliding with
nucleons in the detector reach center-of-mass energies beyond the 14 TeV limit
of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using recently predicted and measured
high-energy and ultra-high-energy neutrino fluxes from IceCube and KM3NeT, we
estimate mass-scale sensitivities for representative new physics scenarios at
1--30 km$^3$ L$\nu$Cs. Our results demonstrate that L$\nu$Cs provide a novel
avenue to probe multi-TeV particles with sensitivities comparable to, or even
surpassing, those of the LHC.

### [4] [Decoherence in high energy collisions as renormalization group flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13951)
*Jiayin Gu,Shi-Jia Lin,Ding Yu Shao,Lian-Tao Wang,Si-Xiang Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework combining soft-collinear effective theory and open quantum system methods to study spin decoherence in high-energy collisions caused by final-state radiation. It identifies decoherence as a phase-flip quantum channel driven by renormalization group (RG) evolution, linking experimental resolution to coherence preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of understanding decoherence in the intersection of quantum information science and collider physics, enabling precise measurements of quantum phenomena in high-energy experiments.

Method: Combines soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) with open quantum system techniques to compute decoherence. Uses renormalization group (RG) evolution of the spin density matrix as a quantum channel, incorporating detector resolution parameters.

Result: Shows that RG flow drives a Markovian loss of quantum information via a phase-flip channel. Provides first systematically RG-improved decoherence predictions dependent on experimental resolution.

Conclusion: Establishes a theoretical tool for precision measurements of quantum effects in colliders and provides new insights into the relationship between RG flow and decoherence in open quantum systems.

Abstract: The unification of quantum information science and collider physics is
opening a new frontier in high-energy experiments, making a systematic
understanding of decoherence a critical challenge. We present a framework to
systematically compute spin decoherence from final-state radiation by combining
soft-collinear effective theory and open quantum system techniques. We
demonstrate that the renormalization group (RG) evolution of the final-state
spin density matrix constitutes a quantum channel, where the RG flow parameter,
rather than time, drives a Markovian loss of quantum information. Our approach
incorporates explicit detector resolution parameters, allowing a direct
connection between experimental capabilities and the preservation of quantum
coherence. Applying this formalism to a fermion pair ($f\bar{f}$) in the
high-energy limit with QED-like final-state radiation, we provide the first
systematically RG-improved prediction for decoherence as a function of
experimental resolution, revealing the underlying decoherence mechanism to be a
phase-flip channel. This work establishes an essential theoretical tool for
future precision measurements of quantum phenomena in high-energy collisions
and offers a new perspective on the interplay between RG flow and decoherence
of open quantum systems.

### [5] [Positivity and partial wave unitarity bounds on ALP theories via amplitude methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13953)
*Luigi C. Bresciani,Gabriele Levati,Paride Paradisi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper derives complete partial wave unitarity and positivity bounds for Axion-Like Particle (ALP) interactions up to dimension 8, applicable to collider searches and rare processes. It also extends these bounds to Standard Model Effective Field Theory contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish rigorous theoretical constraints on ALP interactions ensuring consistency with quantum field theory principles, particularly unitarity and positivity, which are essential for guiding experimental searches and model building.

Method: Uses spinor-helicity techniques to analyze $N 	o M$ scattering amplitudes at high center-of-mass energies. Derives both partial wave unitarity bounds and positivity bounds, then applies these to ALP physics and extends results to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.

Result: Establishes comprehensive unitarity and positivity constraints for ALP interactions up to dimension-8 operators. Demonstrates complementarity between unitarity and positivity bounds. Derives new positivity constraints for the Standard Model Effective Field Theory as a byproduct.

Conclusion: The developed formalism provides essential theoretical tools for interpreting ALP experimental results and constraining beyond-Standard-Model physics. The methods offer a systematic approach to analyzing unitarity/positivity constraints in effective field theories.

Abstract: We derive the complete set of partial wave unitarity bounds on the most
general Axion-Like Particle (ALP) effective interactions up to dimension 8 in
the limit of large center-of-mass energy. Exploiting a recently developed
formalism based on spinor-helicity techniques, we discuss the unitarity bounds
for $N \to M$ (with $N, M \geq 2$) scattering amplitudes that can be relevant
for ALP searches at colliders or in a variety of rare processes. Moreover, we
compute positivity bounds on ALP interactions, emphasizing their
complementarity with partial wave unitarity bounds. As a byproduct, we show
that our results can be used to infer new positivity constraints in the
Standard Model Effective Field Theory.

### [6] [No cosmological constraints on dark photon dark matter from resonant conversion: Impact of nonlinear plasma dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13956)
*Anson Hook,Junwu Huang,Mohamad Shalaby*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper invalidates existing dark photon dark matter constraints by showing resonant energy transfer saturates due to plasma nonlinearities, reducing deposited energy to thermal levels and weakening prior limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess previous constraints on dark photon dark matter, which assumed efficient resonant energy transfer from dark photons to the early universe plasma, potentially leading to overestimated bounds.

Method: Using Particle-in-Cell simulations, the authors model the resonant conversion of dark photons into Langmuir waves and demonstrate how nonlinear plasma effects (e.g., ponderomotive force-driven excitation of higher-k waves) suppress further energy transfer.

Result: The simulations show energy deposition saturates at ~thermal plasma energy, ~10-7 times lower than earlier estimates, weakening constraints by factors of 3000-10^7.

Conclusion: Existing constraints on dark photon dark matter are invalid due to overlooked plasma nonlinearities, reopening parameter space previously considered excluded.

Abstract: We revisit and invalidate all dark photon dark matter constraints from
resonant conversion of dark photons into photons (plasmons) in the early
universe. These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial
portion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the
plasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates
because of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts
into $k \simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma.
Once the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma,
nonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant. In
particular, we show using dedicated Particle-in-Cell simulations that
large-amplitude $k = 0$ Langmuir waves excite higher-k Langmuir and ion
acoustic waves, producing strong spatial variations in density and plasma
frequency. These inhomogeneities suppress further resonant conversion, limiting
the deposited energy to about the thermal energy of the electrons at the time
of conversion, orders of magnitude below observable cosmological thresholds.
Consequently, the dark photon dark matter constraints are weaker by factors of
$3000$ to $10^7$ across ten orders of magnitude in dark photon mass.

### [7] [Light new physics and the $\boldsymbolτ$ lepton dipole moments: prospects at Belle II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13966)
*Martin Hoferichter,Gabriele Levati*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of using asymmetries in e+e-→τ+τ- processes to test New Physics (NP) scenarios involving light spin-0 and spin-1 bosons, showing that such NP can generate measurable asymmetries even without electron polarization, offering a pathway for NP searches at Belle II without requiring polarization upgrades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of testing realistic NP scenarios for the tau lepton, particularly in cases where NP scale is light (not captured by EFT). Existing methods relying on polarized electron beams (e.g., SuperKEKB) are limited to EFT's high NP scale assumption, so this work examines model-dependent approaches for light NP.

Method: The authors analyze asymmetry measurements in e+e-→τ+τ- interactions using light spin-0 and spin-1 bosons as test cases. They compute how these light NP particles generate asymmetries, focusing on their imaginary parts contributing even without electron polarization. They compare results to EFT predictions to observe decoupling behavior as NP scale increases.

Result: Key findings include that light NP (via spin-0/1 bosons) can produce non-zero asymmetries in unpolarized setups due to imaginary components from loop effects. This opens opportunities for NP searches at current Belle II data. Decoupling to EFT limit occurs as NP scale increases beyond center-of-mass energy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that asymmetry measurements at Belle II can constrain NP models with light mediators, even without polarized beams, complementing EFT-based methods. This provides a new experimental avenue for probing beyond-SM physics accessible with existing facilities.

Abstract: While electron and muon dipole moments are well-established precision probes
of physics beyond the Standard Model, it is notoriously challenging to test
realistic New-Physics (NP) scenarios for the $\tau$ lepton. Constructing
suitable asymmetries in $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ has emerged as a promising such
avenue, providing access to the electric and magnetic dipole moment once a
polarized electron beam is available, e.g., with the proposed polarization
upgrade of the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. However, this interpretation relies
on an effective-field-theory (EFT) argument that only applies if the NP scale
is large compared to the center-of-mass energy. In this Letter we address the
consequences of the asymmetry measurements in the case of light NP, using light
spin-0 and spin-1 bosons as test cases, to show how results can again be
interpreted as constraints on dipole moments, albeit in a model-dependent
manner, and how the decoupling to the EFT limit proceeds in these cases. In
particular, we observe that the imaginary parts generated by light new
particles can yield non-vanishing asymmetries even without electron
polarization, presenting opportunities for NP searches that can be realized
already with present data at Belle II.

### [8] [Isospin-based EWP-tree Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13969)
*Bhubanjyoti Bhattacharya,Marianne Bouchard,Alexandre Jean,David London,Ipsita Ray*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that even with the assumption of SU(2) isospin symmetry instead of full SU(3) flavor symmetry in charmless B -> PP decays, electroweak penguin (EWP)-tree relations exist. In ΔS=0 decays, these relations mirror those of SU(3)_F and help in extracting the CP phase α from B→ππ decays. However, in ΔS=1 decays (like B→πK), the SU(2)_I relations differ significantly from SU(3)_F, leading to a larger 4-5σ discrepancy with the Standard Model, highlighting the need to use isospin-based relations for analyses involving isospin-related amplitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in analyses of the B→πK puzzle, which previously relied on SU(3)_F EWP-tree relations despite the isospin-only symmetry of B→πK amplitudes. The goal is to establish valid relations under SU(2)_I to improve accuracy in Standard Model predictions and resolve discrepancies.

Method: The authors derive EWP-tree relations under SU(2)_I symmetry for both ΔS=0 and ΔS=1 decay modes of B mesons. They compare these relations to those derived under SU(3)_F symmetry, particularly focusing on their implications for extracting the CP phase α from B→ππ and analyzing B→πK puzzles.

Result: For ΔS=0 decays, SU(2)_I EWP-tree relations align with SU(3)_F, supporting their use in determining α. However, in ΔS=1 decays (e.g., B→πK), the SU(2)_I relations produce a much larger (4-5σ) deviation from SM predictions compared to previous SU(3)_F-based analyses, indicating methodological errors when using higher symmetries improperly.

Conclusion: Analyses of B meson decays must strictly adhere to the actual symmetry (SU(2)_I) governing their amplitudes rather than overextending SU(3)_F assumptions. This ensures accurate extraction of fundamental parameters like α and properly quantifies departures from the Standard Model in cases like the B→πK anomaly.

Abstract: In 1998, it was shown that, if flavor SU(3) symmetry [SU(3)$_F$] is assumed
in charmless $B \to PP$ decays ($P$ is a light pseudoscalar meson), some
reduced matrix elements involving electroweak penguin (EWP) operators are
related to those involving tree operators. Similarly, EWP diagrams are related
to tree diagrams. These SU(3)$_F$ EWP-tree relations were recently used in
global analyses of $B \to PP$ decays. They have also been used over the years
in analyses of the $B \to \pi K$ puzzle, even though the $B \to \pi K$
amplitudes are related by isospin symmetry [SU(2)$_I$], and not the full
SU(3)$_F$. In this paper, we show that, even if only SU(2)$_I$ is assumed,
there are still EWP-tree relations. In $\Delta S=0$ decays, these relations are
similar to those of SU(3)$_F$, and can be used to take into account the EWP
contributions in the extraction of the CP phase $\alpha$ from $B \to \pi\pi$
decays. In $\Delta S=1$ decays, the SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations are quite
different from those of SU(3)$_F$; when these are used to analyze the $B \to
\pi K$ puzzle, one now finds a 4-5$\sigma$ discrepancy with the SM, much larger
than what was previously found. We argue that, if one analyzes a set of
hadronic $B$ decays whose amplitudes are related by isospin, one must use the
SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations for that set of decays in the analysis.

### [9] [Prospects for Exploring Non-Standard Neutrino Properties with Argon-Based CEvNS Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14015)
*Sam Carey,Vishvas Pandey*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the potential of argon-based CEvNS experiments at various facilities to perform precision tests of Standard Model parameters and search for non-standard neutrino interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage CEvNS as a tool for testing the Standard Model and probing new physics at low energies, particularly through precision measurements of weak interactions and neutrino properties.

Method: The study uses realistic neutrino fluxes and detector configurations for specific facilities (CENNS-10, CENNS-750, CCM, PIP2-BD) to compute event rates and sensitivities for SM tests and non-standard interactions. They analyze observables like the weak mixing angle, neutrino magnetic moment, and effective charge radius.

Result: Argon-based CEvNS detectors can achieve precision measurements of electroweak parameters at lower momentum transfers and provide sensitivity to neutrino electromagnetic properties and non-standard interactions with quarks.

Conclusion: These experiments offer a clean and versatile platform for precision studies of non-standard neutrino properties, highlighting their value in exploring physics beyond the Standard Model.

Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a powerful
framework for testing the Standard Model (SM) and searching for new physics at
low energies. In this work, we examine the prospects for argon-based CEvNS
experiments at stopped-pion sources to perform precision measurements of weak
interactions and probe non-standard neutrino properties. Our study focused on
the CENNS-10 and CENNS-750 detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, the Coherent Captain Mills (CCM) detector at Los
Alamos National Laboratory, and the proposed PIP2-BD detector at Fermilabs
Facility for Dark Matter Discovery (F2D2). Using realistic neutrino fluxes and
detector configurations corresponding to these facilities, we evaluate event
rates and sensitivities to a range of observables. Within the SM, argon-based
CEvNS detectors enable precision tests of electroweak parameters, including the
weak mixing angle, at momentum transfers well below the electroweak scale. We
also investigate the sensitivity of these experiments to neutrino
electromagnetic properties, such as the magnetic moment and effective charge
radius, as well as to possible non-standard neutrino interactions with quarks.
Together, these studies highlight the potential of argon-based CEvNS
experiments as a clean and versatile platform for precision exploration of
non-standard neutrino properties.

### [10] [Chiral spin symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14084)
*L. Ya. Glozman*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the chiral spin symmetry in QCD, suggesting that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are independent. It proposes three phases: hadron gas (no confinement, chiral symmetry broken), stringy fluid (confinement, chiral symmetry restored), and quark-gluon plasma (deconfined). Observations include N_c scaling differences and meson behavior in the stringy fluid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the relationship between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and to understand the phase structure of QCD at high temperatures via chiral spin symmetry.

Method: Analyzes the truncation of near-zero Dirac operator modes, studies N_c scaling of thermodynamic quantities (energy, pressure, entropy), examines fluctuations of conserved charges, and models 3+1D confinement with chirally symmetric quarks.

Result: Chiral spin symmetry indicates hadron masses aren't from quark condensates; confinement persists post-chiral restoration in the stringy fluid. Phase transitions show smooth crossover at T_d > T_ch with N_c scaling distinguishing phases. The model predicts large, overlapping color-singlet 'mesons' in the stringy fluid.

Conclusion: Confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are separate phenomena. The three-phase QCD picture (hadron gas, stringy fluid, QGP) is supported by N_c scaling and meson dynamics, suggesting a smooth transition via chiral spin symmetry breakdown.

Abstract: We review the chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of the color charge
and of the confining electric part of QCD. Observation of this symmetry in the
vacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies
that the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark
condensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are
not directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry
restoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with
chirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining
electric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature
T_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears
suggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a
very smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has
been further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy
density, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as
N_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We
have analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above
T_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid.
When N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the
three-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally
symmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry
restoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet
quark-antiquark systems that become very large at T > T_ch. Consequently the
stringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the
overlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark "mesons" with a very small
mean free path.

### [11] [The Good Qualities of the Weak Axion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14104)

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The presence of a topological susceptibility in the electroweak sector of the
Standard Model motivates the existence of a good quality weak axion $a_W$,
associated with the spontaneous breaking of $B\!+\!L$. Its anomalous couplings
and tiny mass, generated from electroweak instantons, render $a_W$ photophobic.
We find that the strongest bound on the associated decay constant, $f_W$, stems
from a loop-induced coupling to electrons, leading to $f_W \gtrsim 1000$ TeV
from stellar cooling. Spontaneous breaking of the abelian ${B\!+\!L}$ symmetry
induces proton decay via higher dimensional operators controlled by a new
physics scale, $\Lambda$. Existing Super-Kamiokande limits on these decay
channels constrain the new physics scale to be $\Lambda \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV.
The characteristic channel $p\to e^+ a_W$ and other possible operators
mediating interactions with the Standard Model fields yield signals which are
not detectable within the allowed parameter space. Future proton decay searches
at the next-generation of neutrino experiments offer the most promising avenues
to test the good qualities of the weak axion paradigm.

### [12] [Production cross sections of charm-beauty mesons in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14107)
*Madeeha Nazish,Faisal Akram*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates production cross sections of Bc meson 1S and 1P states in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC/RHIC, considering quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams and P states which decay entirely into ground states. It provides nuclear modification factors R_pA and R_AA for Pb, Xe, Au nuclei, offering baseline data for future LHC experiments and strategies to identify new Bc meson states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies ignored quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams and only considered S states for Pb/Au. Since P states lie below BD threshold and fully decay into 1S states, their cross sections are equally important for accurate predictions. The need exists for updated cross sections and nuclear modification factors to guide upcoming experiments.

Method: The authors compute production cross sections using QCD calculations incorporating quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams for both S and P states in pA and AA collisions. They calculate pT, rapidity, pseudorapidity distributions, and nuclear modification factors (R_pA, R_AA) for Pb, Xe, Au at RHIC/LHC energies.

Result: Cross sections for 1S and 1P states are quantified with distributions shown. Nuclear modification factors reveal suppression/enhancement patterns in nuclear collisions. Results establish baseline expectations for LHC Run III data and highlight P states' significance.

Conclusion: Findings provide essential theoretical input for experimental identificaiton of newly discovered Bc meson states. The inclusion of P states and nuclear effects improves predictive accuracy. These results should inform experimental strategies and data analysis in upcoming collision runs at LHC/RHIC.

Abstract: In this work, we calculate the production cross sections of the 1S and 1P
states of the $B_{c}$ meson for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus colliding
beam experiments at LHC and RHIC. We provide estimates for the Au nucleus at
RHIC energies and for the Pb and Xe nuclei at LHC energies. Previous estimates
of these cross sections have ignored quark anti-quark annihilation diagrams and
are confined to S states for Pb and Au nuclei. The cross sections of the P
states are also equally important as these states lie below the BD threshold
and cascade into $B_{c}$ ground states with 100\% probability. In addition to
calculating the $p_{T}$, rapidity, and pseudo-rapidity distributions of the
cross sections, we also determine the nuclear modification factors $R_{pA}$ and
$R_{AA}$ for $A=\textrm{Pb}$, $\textrm{Xe}$, and $\textrm{Au}$. The results
provide a baseline for the upcoming experimental studies of $B_{c}$ mesons in
pp, pA, and AA collisions in RUN III of LHC and could help develop experimental
strategies for identification of hitherto undiscovered states of the $B_{c}$
meson.

### [13] [Hybrid Renormalization with Gradient Flow for Baryon Quasi-Distribution Amplitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14325)
*Jia-lu Zhang,Mu-Hua Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes a factorization relation between baryon quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) with gradient flow and their MS-renormalized counterparts, performs a one-loop calculation to determine the matching kernel and Wilson-line divergence, and introduces a hybrid renormalization scheme combining ratio and gradient-flow matching for lattice QCD analysis to reduce renormalization uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically connect lattice QCD matrix elements with continuum baryon quasi-DAs while minimizing renormalization uncertainties. Existing methods either face limitations in the small flow-time approximation or have uncertainties in renormalization, prompting the need for a more robust hybrid approach.

Method: A one-loop calculation is performed beyond the small flow-time limit to derive the matching kernel and associated Wilson-line divergence. A hybrid renormalization scheme is introduced combining ratio scheme with gradient-flow matching to bridge lattice and continuum results.

Result: The study successfully derives the factorization relation and provides a complete matching kernel. The hybrid scheme demonstrated reduced renormalization uncertainties and clear guidelines for lattice analyses, enabling a more systematic and accurate connection between lattice data and continuum quasi-DAs.

Conclusion: The hybrid scheme effectively addresses renormalization challenges in lattice QCD studies of baryon quasi-DAs, offering a practical framework for future analyses with controlled uncertainties and improved precision in extracting physical quantities from lattice computations.

Abstract: We establish a factorization relation between baryon quasi-distribution
amplitudes (quasi-DAs) defined with gradient flow and their counterparts
renormalized in the $\overline{MS}\,$ scheme. Working beyond the small
flow-time limit, we perform a complete one-loop calculation that yields the
full matching kernel and the associated Wilson-line linear divergence for
flowed quasi-DAs. Building on this relation, we formulate a hybrid
renormalization scheme that combines ratio scheme with gradient-flow matching.
The framework enables a systematic connection between lattice QCD matrix
elements and continuum baryon quasi-DAs, with reduced renormalization
uncertainties and clear guidance for practical lattice analyses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The complete one loop corrections to the trilinear self coupling of the Higgs
boson is firstly evaluated in the Standard Model (SM) by employing the zero
momentum approximation. Numerical results of the trilinear self coupling and
its modifier $\kappa_{\lambda}$ are obtained. Then we extend the SM by
including a singlet vector-like top partner and assume that the top partner
only mixes with the top quark, combining with the latest value of the Higgs
boson trilinear self coupling modifier $\kappa_{\lambda}$ reported by ATLAS
Collaboration, the effects of the mass of the top partner and the mixing
parameter on the modifier $\kappa_{\lambda}$ are systematically analyzed.
Results indicate that the upper bound of the singlet top partner is about
$2800$\,GeV.

*Ricardo Z. Ferreira,M. C. David Marsh,Eike Ravensburg*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes axion-like particles (ALPs) produced in core-collapse supernovae (ccSNe) via interactions with electrons and muons, identifies six production channels (including two loop-level processes involving photons), and examines observational constraints such as anomalous cooling, gamma-ray emissions, and the 511 keV line. Updated constraints on ALP couplings to electrons and muons are provided using three supernova models, showing result variations by factors of 2-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of ALP interactions in supernova environments, refine parameter space constraints, and address uncertainties through multi-model analysis.

Method: 1. Calculated six ALP production channels in ccSNe plasma, including two photon-involving loop processes. 2. Evaluated observational constraints (anomalous cooling, energy deposition, photon decay, gamma-ray background, 511 keV line). 3. Applied three supernova models from two simulation codes to quantify uncertainties.

Result: Updated robust constraints on ALP couplings to electrons/muons; constraint strength varies by factors of 2-10 across different SN models. The study highlights the impact of production/absorption process improvements and model-dependent uncertainties.

Conclusion: SN observations impose significant bounds on ALP-electron/muon couplings, but model dependencies demand caution in interpreting constraints. Future SN modeling improvements and observational data could tighten these limits.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenology of axion-like
particles (ALPs) produced in core-collapse supernovae (ccSNe) through
interactions with electrons and muons, both of which have a non-negligible
abundance in the SN plasma. We identify and calculate six significant
ALP-production channels, two of which are loop-level processes involving
photons. We then examine several observational constraints on the ALP-electron
and ALP-muon parameter spaces. Those include the bounds on anomalous cooling,
energy deposition, decay into photons, diffuse gamma rays, and the 511 keV
line. Our results provide updated and robust constraints on ALP couplings to
electrons and muons from an improved treatment of production and absorption
processes. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties of the results by using
three state-of-the-art supernova models based on two independent simulation
codes, finding that constraints vary by factors of O(2-10).

Abstract: We evaluate the complete set of kinematic power corrections (KPCs) to the
leading power (LP) term of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD)
factorization theorem for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) with
a polarized target. This formulation restores the contributions of twist-two
TMD distributions to all structure functions, including those that vanish at
leading power, such as contributions of longitudinal photons. The resulting
expressions are explicitly gauge- and frame-invariant, and inherit all key
features of the standard TMD factorization framework, including the coefficient
functions and the evolution equations. Numerical estimations show that KPCs
contribute only a few percent at $Q\sim10$GeV, but can reach several tens of
percents when $Q\sim 2$GeV. Consequently, accounting for kinematic power
corrections can be vital for an accurate theoretical description of current
SIDIS measurements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The observation of hybrid mesons in photoproduction experiments can provide
essential insight into the inner workings of quantum chromodynamics in the
strong coupling regime. In particular, the study of final $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$
states is of great interest due to the presence of the lowest lying hybrid
candidate with manifestly exotic quantum numbers, the $\pi_1(1600)$. In this
work, a double-vector exchange model with Reggeized $\rho$ and $\omega$
trajectories is developed to describe the photoproduction of
$\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ in the high-mass region. Results are presented for the
differential cross sections and forward-backward asymmetries in the energy
region of interest to the GlueX experiment. The model contains no free
parameters, and reproduces the magnitude and $t$-dependence of existing CLAS
data at $E_\gamma=5$\gev. The model predicts a stronger asymmetry in the
$\eta^\prime \pi$ channel than in the $\eta \pi$ channel, consistent with what
has previously been observed in pion beam experiments. This suggests that the
sizeable production of exotic odd waves in $\eta'\pi$ is not necessarily
related to the presence of gluon-rich environments. Confirmation of these
predicted asymmetries from forthcoming GlueX data would enable further
predictions of the low-energy spectrum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the photoproduction of J/ψ mesons and understand gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs), vital for probing QCD dynamics and future collider experiments.

Method: Employed factorization approach with gluon GPDs constructed via double distribution representation; extended calculations to ultraperipheral pp collisions at LHC and predicted cross sections for NICA energies.

Result: Achieved agreement with experimental data (LHCb) and provided accurate cross sections and spin asymmetries; predictions for NICA energy range are made.

Conclusion: The model successfully describes experimental results, offering a tool for studying gluon GPDs in upcoming collider experiments like NICA.

Abstract: Study of exclusive photoproduction of $J/\Psi$ mesons was carried out in a
factorization approach. Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for gluons,
which play an important role here, are constructed using the double
distribution representation. The obtained cross sections of $J/\Psi$ production
in a wide energy range are in good agreement with the experiment. The spin
asymmetries in the $J/\Psi$ production were estimated. These calculations were
extended to the of $J/\Psi$ mesons production in ultraperipherical $pp$
collisions. It was shown a good agreement of our results with the LHCb data.
Predictions have been made for the NICA energy range. The model results can be
used to study the gluon GPDs in future colliders.

### [19] [An insight into the rare $Z\rightarrow b \bar{b}γ$ at the HL-LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14597)
*T. Thallapalli,A. Alpana,A. M. Iyer,S. Sharma*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of detecting a new physics signal in the process of producing two b-quarks and a photon at the HL-LHC, by analyzing beyond Standard Model scenarios where the Z boson decays into a light scalar/tensor particle and a photon, which subsequently decays into b jets. The study emphasizes the use of low-momentum jets and machine learning to improve detection and distinguish BSM effects from Standard Model backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the possibility of discovering BSM physics using a final state that could be accessible at the HL-LHC, specifically looking at Z boson decay channels that include low-pT b-jets and photons, which could hint at light scalar or tensor mediators. The motivation stems from the need to explore physics beyond the Standard Model given the Z-pole's historical importance and the HL-LHC's enhanced capabilities.

Method: The analysis considers the signal topology Z→Φγ→b b̄ γ, where Φ is a light scalar or tensor particle. The study uses a framework to identify low-pT b-tagged jets paired with an isolated photon, employs machine learning to assess variable stability, and evaluates the challenges in distinguishing BSM signals from SM backgrounds like Z→b b̄ with photon radiation.

Result: The paper establishes a quantitative method for identifying the signal's features and demonstrates that machine learning can reliably separate BSM signals from SM backgrounds. It underscores the significance of optimizing low-pT jet identification and efficiency at the HL-LHC for such searches.

Conclusion: The study concludes that probing Z-mediated BSM interactions via low-pT b-jets and photons at the HL-LHC is viable, emphasizing the necessity for improved experimental techniques in detecting low-momentum particles. This approach provides a promising avenue for discovering new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Abstract: Studies at the $Z$-pole have played an important role in developing our
understanding of the Standard Model (SM). Continuing the explorations in this
regime, we consider the possibility of the production of two $b$-quarks and a
photon in proton-proton collisions at the HL-LHC. While such a final state is
possible in the SM by means of the process $Z\rightarrow b\bar b$ decay with a
radiated photon, the focus is on extracting its possible origins due to beyond
Standard Model (BSM) physics. The signal topology can be broadly identified as
$Z\rightarrow \Phi\gamma\rightarrow b\bar b\gamma$, where $ \Phi$ can either be
a spin-0 or spin-2 state with a mass less than that of the $Z$ boson.The
analysis is characterised by two relatively low $p_T$ jets that are required to
be $b$-tagged jets and an isolated photon. The study provides a quantitative
framework for their identification and highlights the potential challenges
associated with this final state. A range of machine learning architectures is
employed to demonstrate the stability and reliability of the discriminating
variables. This study highlights the importance of the low-$p_T$ objects in
searches at the HL-LHC, hence the need to pay special attention to their
identification and efficiencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand gluon behavior at very low x by deriving accessible analytical expressions that match complex calculations.

Method: Application of Laplace transform technique considering leading and next-to-leading contributions to derive gluon density expressions.

Result: Compact analytical expressions for gluon densities at asymptotic low x, consistent with other methods but simpler.

Conclusion: The derived expressions are valid and capture essential physics, offering a simplified alternative to more complex approaches.

Abstract: We investigate the gluon distribution in a proton at very low $x$, both
integrated and transverse momentum dependent, using the Laplace transform
technique. By accounting for leading and main next-to-leading contributions, we
derive compact analytical expressions for the gluon densities valid in the
asymptotic limit $x \to 0$. Our results closely match those from other
analytical and numerical approaches, with the main advantage being the
simplicity of the expressions, which capture the essential features of more
complex calculations.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper calculates two-loop corrections to the Higgs-gluon coupling in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), focusing on contributions from class 3 and 7 operators in the Warsaw basis. It evaluates their impact in both bottom-up and top-down frameworks (e.g., vector-like quark models) for Higgs data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision in Higgs physics by considering two-loop effects from SMEFT operators, ensuring accurate predictions for Higgs data fits and model testing.

Method: Computed two-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) for Higgs to gluon coupling focusing on SMEFT operators in classes 3 and 7 of the Warsaw basis. Analyzed results in both bottom-up SMEFT fits and specific UV-complete models with vector-like quarks.

Result: Completed two-loop RGE contributions from these operators, showing significant impacts on Higgs coupling fits. Demonstrated that these effects can modify predictions at the ~10% level in certain scenarios, emphasizing their importance for high-precision analyses.

Conclusion: Two-loop SMEFT corrections from classes 3/7 operators are essential for precise Higgs phenomenology. Their inclusion is critical for robust model comparisons and interpreting Higgs data at colliders.

Abstract: We compute the two-loop renormalisation group equation for the effective
Higgs to gluon coupling in Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Concretely,
we present the contributions generated by the operators belonging to class 3
and 7 in the Warsaw basis, completing the two-loop renormalization program of
the Higgs-gluon coupling proportional to the top Yukawa coupling for
potentially tree-level generated operators. We investigate the phenomenological
impact of the contributions in fits to Higgs data both in a bottom-up approach
and a top-down approach in terms of UV models with vector-like quarks.

### [22] [The exclusive photoproduction of $χ_{c}γ$ pairs in the small-$x$ kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14767)
*M. Siddikov,I. Zemlyakov,M. Roa*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the exclusive photoproduction of χcγ pairs at small-x kinematics using the Color Glass Condensate framework. It finds that the process is sensitive to the forward color dipole scattering amplitude at leading order in α_s. Cross-sections for different χc polarizations are estimated for LHC and future EIC collisions. The χcγ process is identified as a significant background to odderon studies via χc photoproduction at small |t|, but less relevant at higher |t|. Radiative decays of ψ(2S) mesons are found to be a major background source for odderon searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the feasibility of using χcγ photoproduction as a probe for small-x QCD dynamics and assess its impact as a background in odderon-mediated χc production experiments. The work addresses the need for understanding backgrounds in proposed odderon studies using exclusive χc photoproduction.

Method: The analysis employs the Color Glass Condensate framework to compute cross-sections for exclusive χcγ photoproduction. Calculations focus on leading-order α_s contributions, relying on forward color dipole scattering amplitudes. Numerical estimates are performed for ultraperipheral collisions at LHC and future EIC energies, considering different χc polarizations and momentum transfers |t|.

Result: The cross-sections for χcγ production show significant contributions as background to odderon signals at |t| ≤1 GeV². However, their relevance diminishes at higher |t|. A dominant competing background is identified from radiative ψ(2S) decays, which may complicate odderon detection through χc channels.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of considering χcγ production backgrounds in small-x physics experiments targeting odderon signatures. It emphasizes that radiative ψ(2S) decays must be carefully accounted for in experimental designs to ensure viable odderon searches via χc photoproduction.

Abstract: In this manuscript we analyze the exclusive photoproduction of the
$\chi_{c}\gamma$ pairs. We focus on the small-$x$ kinematics and evaluate the
cross-sections in the Color Glass Condensate framework. We found that in the
leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$, this process is sensitive
only to the forward color dipole scattering amplitude. We estimated numerically
the cross-sections for different polarizations of $\chi_{c}$ mesons in the
kinematics of the ultraperipheral collisions at LHC and the future Electron Ion
Collider. We also analyzed the role of this process as a potential background
to exclusive $\chi_{c}$ photoproduction, which has been recently suggested as
an alternative channel for studies of odderons. According to our estimates, the
cross-section of $\chi_{c}\gamma$ with undetected photons is comparable to that
of odderons at small momentum transfer $|t|\lesssim1$ GeV$^{2}$, but becomes
less relevant at larger $|t|$. We also found that a dominant background to
odderon-mediated production of $\chi_{c}$ comes from the radiative decays of
$\psi(2S)$ mesons, which potentially can present a challenge for odderon
studies via $\chi_{c}$ photoproduction.

### [23] [Nucleon Electric Dipole Moments in Paramagnetic Molecules through Effective Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14933)
*Wouter Dekens,Jordy de Vries,Lemonia Gialidi,Javier Menéndez,Heleen Mulder,Beatriz Romeo*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: A new effective field theory framework links molecular electric dipole moments (EDMs) in paramagnetic molecules like BaF to nucleon EDMs, enabling better interpretation of experiments and setting limits on nucleon EDMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paramagnetic molecule EDM experiments were analyzed via electron EDM but are also sensitive to hadronic CP violation sources, necessitating a new framework for accurate interpretation.

Method: Developed an effective field theory to relate molecular EDMs to neutron and proton EDMs, identified dominant contributions via power counting, calculated nuclear matrix elements using shell model for BaF.

Result: Calculated nuclear matrix elements for BaF and estimated current experimental limits on nucleon EDMs from molecular EDM measurements.

Conclusion: The framework improves interpretation of molecular EDM experiments, connects them to fundamental nucleon properties, and provides tighter constraints on CP-violating hadronic effects.

Abstract: Electric dipole moment (EDM) measurements using paramagnetic molecules have
significantly advanced over the last decade. Traditionally, these experiments
have been analyzed in terms of the electron EDM. However, paramagnetic
molecules are also sensitive to hadronic sources of charge-parity (CP)
violation, highlighting the need for a new framework to interpret the
experimental results. In this Letter, we introduce an effective field theory
framework to relate molecular EDMs to the EDMs of neutrons and protons. We
identify the dominant contributions through power counting and pinpoint the
necessary nuclear matrix elements. As a practical application, we employ the
nuclear shell model to calculate these nuclear matrix elements for the polar
molecule BaF. Finally, we estimate the limits on the nucleon EDMs set by
current molecular EDM experiments.

### [24] [Invisible neutron decay and light BSM particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14940)
*J. C. Helo,M. Hirsch,T. Ota*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Invisible neutron decay can result from d=(7-9) operators when the SM is extended with light particles like right-handed neutrinos, axion-like particles, singlet scalars, or a Z'. Observing such decays without charged lepton emissions could signal new neutral particles, and the authors explore possible LHC signatures for these scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how adding light particles beyond the Standard Model (SM) can lower the dimension of operators governing invisible neutron decay (from d=12 in SM) and investigate implications for new physics, especially if future experiments observe such decays without charged leptons.

Method: The authors analyze four scenarios extending SM with (i) right-handed neutrinos, (ii) right-handed neutrinos + axion-like particles, (iii) right-handed neutrinos + massless singlet scalar, and (iv) right-handed neutrinos + light Z'. They derive tree-level operators of dimensions 7-9 enabling invisible decay and discuss associated LHC search signatures.

Result: Operators of lower dimensions (d=7-9) can mediate invisible neutron decay when SM is extended with specific light particles. These setups provide distinct LHC signals tied to the proposed new states, offering avenues for experimental verification.

Conclusion: Observation of invisible neutron decay without charged products would strongly indicate new neutral particles, while LHC searches for exotic states in the proposed UV completions can test these scenarios empirically.

Abstract: In Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) invisible neutron
  decay arises from $d=12$ operators. Adding new, light particles to
  the field content of the SM, such as right-handed neutrinos, allows
  to construct operators for invisible neutron decay at much lower
  dimensions. Observing invisible neutron decay, if nucleon decays
  with charged leptons remain absent, would therefore point towards the
  existence of new neutral degrees of freedom. Here, we discuss four
  cases: (i) Adding right-handed neutrinos to the SM; (ii) a
  right-handed neutrino and an axion-like particle; (iii) a
  right-handed neutrino and a (nearly) massless singlet scalar; and
  (iv) a right-handed neutrino and a light $Z'$. We give the general
  tree-level decomposition for the resulting $d=(7-9)$ operators for
  invisible neutron decay. We also briefly discuss LHC searches
  related to the exotic states found in these UV completions.

Abstract: We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid
(NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at
reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN).
Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that
when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently
amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of
NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is
carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional
MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to
trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under
realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field
strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$),
NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a
self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength
of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields
($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to
drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through
parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We
give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for
PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.

### [26] [Radiation Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of sub-Eddington Circumbinary Disk in a 10:1 Massive Black Hole Binary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13955)
*Vishal Tiwari,Chi-Ho Chan,Tamara Bogdanović,Yan-Fei Jiang,Shane W. Davis*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of radiation on circumbinary disks (CBDs) around massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) using 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations. Compared to non-radiative disks, radiation causes the CBD to be thinner, denser, less eccentric at the inner edge, and more filamentary. The unequal-mass MBHB (mass ratio 0.1) produces significantly brighter and more variable thermal emission in the far-UV/soft X-ray range, with light curve periodicities linked to binary orbital periods. These findings emphasize radiation's role in shaping CBD structure and observational features, relevant for detecting MBHBs via electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave signals and Pulsar Timing Array observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how radiation affects the structure and observational properties of circumbinary disks around massive black hole binaries, and to assess implications for detecting these binaries through electromagnetic emissions associated with gravitational wave precursors observed by missions like LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays.

Method: Global 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations of a CBD around an unequal-mass MBHB (mass ratio 0.1, total mass 2×10⁷ M☉, separation 100 GM_tot/c²). Comparisons were made with an equal-mass binary and a non-radiative (locally isothermal) MHD disk to isolate radiation's effects.

Result: Radiation-induced changes to the CBD include reduced thickness, increased density, lower eccentricity at the inner edge, and enhanced filamentary structure. The unequal-mass binary's CBD emits thermal radiation peaking in near-UV/optical (∼1% L_Edd, 0.23 M_-dot_Edd accretion), with far-UV/soft X-ray variability orders of magnitude higher than equal-mass systems. Light curves show periodicities at 2 binary orbits for the unequal-mass system versus 2.5-5 orbits for equal-mass binaries.

Conclusion: Radiation plays a critical role in determining both the structural characteristics and observable signatures of MBHB circumbinary disks. These findings underscore the necessity of including radiation in MBHB simulations for accurate predictions of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events, aiding future detection efforts by missions like LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays.

Abstract: We present a global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD)
simulation of a circumbinary disk (CBD) around a massive black hole binary
(MBHB) with a total mass $2 \times 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $0.1$,
separated by $100\, GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation makes the
disk thinner, denser, less eccentric at the inner edge, and more filamentary
when compared to an otherwise identical locally isothermal MHD disk. The RMHD
disk has accretion rate $\sim 0.23\,\dot{M}_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ and produces
thermal emission peaking in the near-UV/optical with a luminosity of $\sim 1\,
\% L_{\rm {Edd }}$. Compared with an equal-mass binary with the same total
mass, the thermal emission of the CBD around the unequal-mass binary is several
orders of magnitude brighter and much more variable at far-UV/soft X-rays
frequencies. Similarly, we find that the light curve associated with the $0.1$
mass ratio binary exhibits dominant periodicity corresponding to 2 binary
orbits, compared to the equal-mass binary that shows periodicity at 2.5-5
binary orbits. Our results highlight the importance of radiation for the
structure and observational properties of MBHB circumbinary disks and have
implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational
wave precursors and for the heavier binaries targeted by the Pulsar Timing
Arrays.

### [27] [Investigating Nonlinear Landau Damping in Hybrid Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14031)
*Benedikt Schroer,Damiano Caprioli,Pasquale Blasi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates nonlinear Landau damping's role in cosmic-ray self-confinement through hybrid-PIC simulations. It finds damping rates depend on larger-scale magnetic power and identifies an inverse cascade creating larger-scale fields. Broader cosmic-ray distributions and pre-existing Alfvénic turbulence profoundly affect confinement dynamics, potentially inhibiting streaming instability growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies in phenomenological models of cosmic-ray self-confinement, which rely on linear theory despite debates over nonlinear Landau damping's role. The study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment using simulations, extending prior work on mono-energetic distributions to broader cosmic-ray spectra and incorporating effects of pre-existing turbulence.

Method: Used hybrid-PIC simulations in resonant streaming instability regimes to measure nonlinear Landau damping rates. Analyzed dependence of damping on larger-scale magnetic field power and the development of inverse cascades. Considered broader cosmic-ray distributions beyond mono-energetic cases, and included scenarios with pre-existing Alfvénic turbulence at large scales.

Result: Found damping rates of magnetic modes depend on power in larger-scale fields, forming an inverse cascade generating larger-scale magnetic structures. Pre-existing Alfvénic turbulence significantly impacts low-energy cosmic-ray wave damping, potentially suppressing streaming instability growth and leading to all-or-nothing cosmic-ray confinement.

Conclusion: Phenomenological models must account for scale-dependent damping via larger-scale magnetic power and inverse cascades, especially in scenarios with broader cosmic-ray distributions and pre-existing turbulence. This challenges previous assumptions about nonlinear Landau damping's universality and highlights the need for multi-scale treatments in cosmic-ray confinement studies.

Abstract: Phenomenological studies of cosmic-ray self-confinement often hinge on the
linear theory for the growth rate of the streaming instability and for the
damping rate of the generated magnetic modes. Largely different expressions
exist, especially for the rate of nonlinear Landau damping, which is often
assumed to be the most important damping mechanism in warm ionized plasmas.
Using hybrid-PIC simulations in the resonant streaming instability regime, we
present a comprehensive assessment of nonlinear Landau damping and show that
the damping rate at a given scale depends on the power in magnetic fields on
larger scales. Furthermore, we find that an inverse cascade develops, which
produces magnetic fields on scales larger than the resonant ones. Here we
extend previous results obtained for a mono-energetic distribution of
non-thermal particles to the case of broader CR distributions, as a first step
towards developing phenomenological models. Pre-existing turbulence of
Alfv\'enic nature at large scales severely affects the damping of waves
produced by low-energy CRs; depending on its amplitude, such a turbulence may
inhibit the growth of streaming instability so that CRs are either
self-confined at all energies or not at all.

Abstract: Ultra-relativistic plasma outflows are intrinsically connected with gamma-ray
bursts. Over the years, a large number of analytical and numerical works has
been devoted to understanding the intricacies of their complex dynamics, with
most of these past studies performed in the ideal MHD regime. We propose a
self-similar formalism, based on the expansion of the equations of resistive
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for the description of these outflows in the
vicinity of their symmetry axis and present semi-analytical solutions
describing strongly relativistic jets in both the ideal and resistive MHD
regimes. Our solutions provide a clear picture of the impact of electromagnetic
dissipation on the acceleration and collimation mechanisms which determine the
kinetic and morphological characteristics of these relativistic outflows. The
resistive MHD solutions are compared to their ideal MHD counterparts, revealing
the key differences between the two regimes. Our comparative analysis sheds
light on the possible role of electromagnetic dissipation in shaping the
dynamics of the ultra-relativistic outflows associated with gamma-ray bursts.

Abstract: Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) merger
remnant are a cheap alternative to 3D simulations. To maintain realism for
secular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in
conserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent
transport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also
crucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis
singularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break
flux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant
drifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that
maintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation
of the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare
the numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations
when evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS
merger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis
smoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum
conservation of other conservative methods on $\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of
viscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in
the remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving
the entropy density. We show how physical heating and cooling terms can be
easily calculated from source terms of the conservative evolution variables and
demonstrate our implementation. Finally, we discuss and implement improvements
to the effective viscosity scheme to better model the effect of
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities as the remnant evolves.

### [30] [The 2025 Failed Outburst of IGR J17091-3624: Spectral Evolution and the Role of Ionized Absorbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14134)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The 2025 'failed' outburst of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624 was analyzed using NuSTAR observations. The source remained in the hard state without transitioning to the soft state, showing coronal spectral evolution and dips linked to ionized obscuration, offering insights into the system's structure and orbital parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the unusual 'failed' outburst behavior of IGR J17091-3624, which brightened but did not enter the soft state, and to understand the cause of observed dips and coronal changes during the hard state.

Method: Six NuSTAR observations were conducted during the 2025 outburst. Spectral and timing analyses were performed to investigate hard-state spectral evolution, dips, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). X-ray light curves, power density spectra, and relativistic disk reflection models were used.

Result: Coronal properties evolved with luminosity, showing stable relativistic disk reflection across the first five epochs. A strong, stable QPO was present. Epoch 5's dips indicated partial obscuration by ionized material (N_H ~2e23 cm⁻²). No soft-state variability was observed.

Conclusion: The failed outburst's hard-state persistence suggests inhibited mass accretion or disk instabilities. The dips likely originate from ionized wind or precessing structures. These findings constrain the system's orbital parameters and distance, advancing our understanding of black hole binary dynamics.

Abstract: IGR J17091-3624 is the only black hole X-ray binary candidate, aside from the
well-studied black hole system GRS 1915+105, observed to exhibit a wide range
of structured variability patterns in its light curves. In 2025, the source
underwent a ``failed'' outburst: it brightened in the hard state but did not
transition to the soft state before returning to quiescence within a few weeks.
During this period, IGR J17091-3624 was observed by multiple ground- and
space-based facilities. Here, we present results from six pointed NuSTAR
observations obtained during the outburst. None of the NuSTAR light curves
showed the exotic variability classes typical of the soft state in this source;
however, we detected, for the first time, strong dips in the count rate during
one epoch, with a total duration of $\sim4\,\mathrm{ks}$ as seen by NuSTAR.
Through spectral and timing analysis of all six epochs, we investigate the
hard-state spectral evolution and the nature of the dips. A clear evolution of
the coronal properties with luminosity is observed over all six epochs, with
clear signatures of relativistic disk reflection which remain largely unchanged
across the first five epochs. The first five epochs also show a strong and
stable quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature in the power spectra. The dips
observed in Epoch 5 are consistent with partial obscuration by ionized material
with a column density $N_{\mathrm{H}} \approx 2.0 \times
10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We discuss possible origins for this material and
place constraints on the orbital parameters and distance of the system.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The binary black hole merger GW231123 is both the most massive
gravitational-wave event observed and has the highest component spins measured
to date. The dimensionless spins of the more massive (primary) and less massive
(secondary) black holes are measured to be $\chi_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and
$\chi_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ ($90\%$ credible intervals), respectively. Its
large mass and extremal spins are challenging to explain through standard
binary stellar physics, though a flurry of hypothetical scenarios have been
proposed. Hierarchical assembly -- i.e., mergers of black holes that are
themselves formed from previous generations of mergers -- is generally a
promising way to explain massive and rapidly spinning black holes. Here, we
investigate the possibility that both GW231123 was assembled hierarchically in
a dense star cluster as the merger of two second-generation black holes. Taking
the inferred spin values at face value, we find that it is possible, though
unlikely ($p\lesssim 1\%$), that a compact binary with both component spins
like GW231123 could form in a cluster from hierarchical assembly.

*Mehdy Lefkir,Simon Vaughan,Mike Goad,Daniela Huppenkothen,Phil Uttley*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes X-ray variability in 56 unabsorbed AGN using a new method, revealing power spectra bending at specific timescales linked to black hole mass and luminosity. It updates the X-ray variability plane with a large dataset and reports new low-frequency bends in three AGN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of AGN X-ray variability mechanisms and the relationship between power spectrum bends, black hole mass, and luminosity, addressing challenges posed by irregularly sampled light curves.

Method: Applied a novel method for estimating parameters of bending power law spectra to XMM-Newton/Swift data of 56 AGN in the 0.3-1.5 keV band over 20 years. Analyzed irregularly sampled light curves to determine bend timescales and spectral indices.

Result: Detected bends in 50 sources, largest soft X-ray bend sample. High-frequency spectra steeper than 2. Updated variability plane with bend timescales from 7 mins to 62 days. Discovered low-frequency bends in five AGN, three new (1H 1934-063, Mkn 766, Mkn 279).

Conclusion: Confirms bend timescale correlation with black hole mass and possible luminosity connection. Highlights method effectiveness for uneven data. New detections enrich AGN variability understanding and suggest further study of steep high-frequency slopes.

Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies are the engine
of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show
dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The
power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law
that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high
frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the
mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the
`X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly
sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous
paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power
law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56
variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the
$0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends
in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We
also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We
update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements
spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends
in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H
1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.

### [33] [Revisiting electron-capture decay for Galactic cosmic-ray data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14544)
*M. Borchiellini,D. Maurin,M. Vecchi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines the role of electron-capture (EC) unstable species in Galactic cosmic rays, assessing their decay effects using new data from missions like Voyager, AMS-02, ACE-CRIS, CALET, and Super-TIGER. It finds EC decay impacts are minimal except for specific isotopes like ⁵¹Cr, ⁵⁵Fe, and Co, and confirms the standard two-level approximation is generally valid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the constraints EC-unstable species impose on cosmic ray transport times and their potential as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities. The increasing number of EC-unstable species with mass suggests larger impacts for heavy nuclei, motivating a detailed analysis of their decay effects.

Method: Transport equation solved for multi-level electron configurations in diffusion and leaky-box models. Analyzed data from multiple detectors (Voyager, AMS-02, ACE-CRIS, etc.) focusing on low-energy and heavy/very-heavy nuclei. Compared standard two-level approximation with multi-level models.

Result: Decay fractions showed similar qualitative trends between models but differing absolute fluxes. EC decay's impact is negligible except potentially for ⁵¹Cr, ⁵⁵Fe, and Co. Standard two-level approximation remains sufficient under most conditions. Results robust to uncertainties in cross-sections.

Conclusion: Current data shows minimal EC decay effects except for specific isotopes. Further investigation is warranted for upcoming projects targeting higher Z nuclei (Z>30) to better constrain cosmic ray transport models and EC decay contributions.

Abstract: Electron-capture (EC) unstable species in Galactic cosmic rays constrain the
time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and acceleration. They have also been
advocated as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities during their
transport. The number of EC-unstable species grows with mass, with an expected
EC-decay impact more important for larger atomic number and lower energy. We
revisit the modelling of EC decay and its detectability in the context of
recent unmodulated low-energy (Voyager) and high-precision data for heavy
(AMS-02) and very-heavy nuclei (ACE-CRIS, CALET and Super-TIGER). We solve the
transport equation for a multi-level configuration (up to any number of
electrons attached) in the diffusion and leaky-box models. Their decayed
fractions are found to be qualitatively similar but with very different
absolute fluxes. We check that the standard two-level approximation, wherein
the cosmic-ray nucleus is fully ionised or with one electron attached, is
sufficient for most situations. We find that the impact of EC-decay is
negligible in current data, except possibly for fluxes or ratios involving
$^{51}$Cr, $^{55}$Fe, and Co. These conclusions are robust against significant
uncertainties in the attachment and stripping cross-sections. This first
analysis calls for further investigation, as several forthcoming projects
(e.g., TIGERISS) are targeting $Z>30$ cosmic rays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the observation window for air showers and improve data-taking uptime through dynamic range extension, enabling more precise measurements and better integration with existing infrastructure like IceTop.

Method: Upgrading the scintillator detectors and firmware in the prototype station to increase dynamic range and uptime, using 8 scintillators and 3 radio antennas per station, along with a centralized DAQ system. Performance evaluation includes angular resolution analysis when combining data from scintillation detectors and IceTop.

Result: The upgraded station demonstrated improved performance, extended observation capabilities, and successful integration with additional stations during recent deployment.

Conclusion: The enhancements validate the design for the surface array expansion, showing promise in advancing experimental capabilities for studying cosmic particles via air shower detection.

Abstract: The prototype station of the Surface Array Enhancement at the IceCube
Neutrino Observatory has been taking data in its final design since 2023. This
station is part of the planned extension within the footprint of the existing
surface array, IceTop. One station consists of 8 scintillator detectors, 3
radio antennas, and a central DAQ. The final upgrade of the scintillation
detectors and their firmware at the prototype station has extended the dynamic
range and increased the data-taking up-time, thereby expanding the observation
window for air showers. This contribution will discuss the performance of the
upgraded prototype station after commissioning and its angular resolution
capabilities when observing air showers with the scintillation detectors and in
coincidence with IceTop. Furthermore, the integration of additional stations
during the most recent deployment will be discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent long-term radio monitoring of tidal disruption events (TDEs) suggests
that radio afterglows are common. Most studies argue that these afterglows may
arise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE
outflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical
models do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which
introduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study
the hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the
synchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with
non-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are
explored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a
Galactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance
of 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early
times and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of
the high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline
pattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are
clearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred
from radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly
from those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those
from simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.

### [36] [Exploring a cosmic ray inverse-Compton origin to the SZ-to-X-ray pressure deficit in the cool core cluster ZwCl 3146](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14820)
*Emily M. Silich,Jack Sayers,Philip F. Hopkins,Charles Romero,Brian Mason,John Orlowski-Scherer,Craig L. Sarazin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates whether inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by GeV cosmic rays from an AGN in a cool core cluster (ZwCl 3146) creates an X-ray signal mistaken as thermal bremsstrahlung, contributing to the cooling flow problem. The analysis found a ~30% pressure deficit in X-ray vs SZ measurements within 100 kpc, supporting CR-IC contamination. However, larger studies are needed to confirm its relevance to the cooling flow problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cooling flow problem—why there's less star formation than expected from X-ray cooling rates—the paper explores if non-thermal IC emission from AGN-accelerated cosmic rays misleads thermal pressure estimates.

Method: Analyzed ZwCl 3146 using X-ray and SZ effect data. Compared pressures (P<SUB>SZ</SUB>/P<SUB>X</SUB>), tested two-component spectral models (thermal IC<EM>M</EM> + CR-IC), and evaluated systematics like triaxiality.

Result: Measured ~30% P<SUB>SZ</SUB>/P<X> deficit (3.3σ) within 100 kpc, consistent with CR-IC contamination. Two-component fits support CR-IC as cause; systematic effects likely explain ≤10% decrement.

Conclusion: CR-IC emission plausibly contaminates X-ray pressure estimates in CC clusters, but larger cluster samples are needed to confirm its role in the cooling flow problem. Reassesses prior thermal assumptions in X-ray analyses.

Abstract: We explore the possibility that inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic
microwave background photons by $\sim$GeV cosmic rays (CRs) injected by the
central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in cool core (CC) clusters produces a
non-negligible continuum-like X-ray signal that is easily misinterpreted as
intracluster medium (ICM) thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. This is
particularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation
relative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC
system at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only
thermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the
X-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\simeq30\%$ decrement
in $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical
significance of $\simeq 3.3\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from
CR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection.
X-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC
emission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test
alternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement,
with the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality.
Collectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$
decrement $\gtrsim10\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC
emission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of
larger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is
relevant to the cooling flow problem.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents high-resolution general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with different spin configurations to study their dynamics, ejecta properties, and multi-messenger observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test general relativity, explore matter at supranuclear densities, and understand heavy element origins by analyzing gravitational and electromagnetic signals from these mergers.

Method: Used updated BAM code for simulations, incorporating relativistic mean-field equation of state. Ran two spin configurations, evolved systems up to 100 ms post-merger with 93m grid spacing to capture ejecta and winds.

Result: Non-spinning system had more violent mergers with more ejecta (lower electron fraction, higher velocities). Spinning system formed larger accretion disks. Magnetic field strengths differed over time. Calculated nucleosynthesis yields and kilonova light curves.

Conclusion: Spin configurations significantly impact merger dynamics and post-merger outcomes, emphasizing the need for high-resolution simulations to accurately predict multi-messenger observables for astrophysical interpretations.

Abstract: The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique
opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear
densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As
multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic
radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals
relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate
the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code,
we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a
state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory
developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical
ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve
the systems up to $\sim 100\ \rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high
resolution with a grid spacing of $\Delta x \approx 93\ \rm m$ across the
neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a
more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and
higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to
its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification
within $\lesssim 10\ \rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the
non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at
later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract
the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected
kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.

### [38] [Multi-wavelength analysis of the progenitor of GRB 230307A via Bayesian model comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14879)
*V. Alfradique,R. da Mata,J. C. Rodríguez-Ramírez,C. R. Bom*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores possible progenitors for the bright GRB 230307A, evaluating BNS, NS-WD, NS-BH, and TDE scenarios. It favors a BNS or NS-WD merger leading to a kilonova powered jointly by a magnetar and Ni-56 decay. Bayesian analysis yields precise parameters like Ni-56 mass (∼0.0004 solar masses), ejecta mass (0.06 solar masses), and progenitor binary masses (∼1.8 and 1.6 solar masses). Natal kick parameters suggest orbital alignment for observed velocity offsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRB 230307A's progenitor is still unknown despite its brightness. The study aims to identify the most plausible progenitor system and clarify the kilonova energy source through multi-model analysis.

Method: The team analyzed four progenitor scenarios using Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve fitting across three central engine models (r-process decay, magnetar-driven, combined). Models were evaluated via Bayes factors and LOO cross-validation.

Result: BNS or NS-WD mergers are favored, with the combined magnetar-Ni-56 model optimally explaining observations. Stellar mass estimates were derived, along with tidal deformability parameters and constraints on natal kick velocities (~100-150 km/s) and binary separations (~2-3 solar radii).

Conclusion: The study confirms that GRB 230307A's kilonova is best explained by BNS/NS-WD mergers powered by a magnetar plus Ni-56 decay, providing insights into progenitor mass distributions and post-merger dynamics like natal kicks.

Abstract: GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of
plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible
progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white
dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal
disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole.
Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the
kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a
two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole
spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni
radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses
using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance
through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our
results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing
a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a
${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of
$0.06\,M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within
this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} =
1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\,M_{\odot}$,
with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} =
471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the
observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic
velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the
required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within
$v'_{\mathrm{k}}\sim100$--$150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and
$a_0\sim2$--$3~R_{\odot}$, respectively.

*Isabel S. Sands,Philip F. Hopkins,Sam B. Ponnada*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study demonstrates using MHD simulations that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to Fermi bubbles can originate from star formation and supernova feedback, not AGN. The simulations show varying spectral compositions over time, with good fits to Fermi-LAT data, and predict observable multi-wavelength features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin of Fermi bubbles and distinguish between AGN-driven and star formation driven mechanisms using detailed MHD simulations with cosmic ray transport.

Method: Performed MHD simulations with cosmological initial conditions, incorporating dynamical multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins. Modeled gamma-ray emission mechanisms including neutral pion decay, Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering in three Milky-Way mass galaxies.

Result: All three simulated galaxies showed persistent gamma-ray outflows. Spectral characteristics (flux ratios between emission mechanisms) matched Fermi-LAT observations during lepton/hadron dominated phases. Predicted observable features in soft X-ray and radio synchrotron emissions.

Conclusion: Star formation and supernova feedback alone can produce Fermi-like bubbles, challenging the AGN-driven paradigm. Multi-wavelength observations (X-ray/radio) provide new tools to study cosmic ray physics and galactic center activity.

Abstract: For the first time, we show in MHD simulations with cosmological initial
conditions that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to the Fermi bubbles can
form from star formation and supernova feedback, without involvement from
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use simulations run with full MHD and
dynamical, on-the-fly multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins
to model gamma-ray emission in Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies from neutral pion
decay, relativistic non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering.
We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass
simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray
spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and
hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux
from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the
measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict
multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially
providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic
medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.

Abstract: Galactic microquasar SS433 and the radio nebula W50 surrounding it present a
prototypical example of a hyper-Eddington binary system shaping its ambient
interstellar medium via energetic outflows. In this paper, we present X-ray
observations of the SS433/W50 complex by the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG
space observatory. These data provide images of the entire nebula characterized
by a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray
emission. In particular, these data illustrate a close connection between the
thermal and non-thermal components of W50 on scales ranging from sub-parsecs,
represented by narrow X-ray bright filaments, to the entire extent $\gtrsim
100\,{\rm pc}$ of the nebula. These data also allow us to fully characterize a
pair of nearly symmetric, sharp-edged, elongated structures aligned with the
orbital axis of the binary system, which lack radio counterparts, but are
prominent in very high energy gamma-ray emission. The resulting multifaceted
picture of the interaction between energetic outflows and the surrounding
medium paves the way for future focused multiwavelength observations and
dedicated numerical simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we study the time evolution of radial kinks in the background
of boson stars. In particular, we consider two types of boson stars: the
massive boson star and the solitonic boson star. For each boson star, we study
the dynamics of the kinks with four different compactnesses. We observe that
the greater the compactness is, the slower the kinks move towards the origin of
the boson stars, indicating that the compactness will hinder the kinks to
collide with the origin. Additionally, it is found that when the boson star is
highly compact, a new kink may turn out after the kink colliding with the
origin, instead of immediately dissipating into the background. We then propose
that the radial kinks may potentially serve as a means to probe the internal
structures of dense astrophysical objects, even the interior structure of black
holes.

remains necessary for these wormhole solutions in Unimodular Gravity, in
accordance with the long-established theoretical constraints already identified
in General Relativity.

### [43] [On the Geometric Meaning of General Relativity and the Foundations of Newtonian Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13934)
*Jaume de Haro,Emilio Elizalde*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper revisits General Relativity's geometric foundations, focusing on gauge invariance and curvature as dynamic interplay between matter and fields. It reconstructs a Newtonian framework for cosmology, emphasizing relational dynamics over static spacetime substance, and highlights parallels to quantum approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clearer understanding of spacetime's true nature by reinterpreting curvature and gauge invariance, reviving Einstein and Weyl's insights often overlooked in modern literature.

Method: Re-examining geometric foundations of General Relativity, emphasizing dynamic relationships between matter and fields. Reconstructs a Newtonian cosmological framework to bridge classical and modern geometric perspectives.

Result: Demonstrates that classical Newtonian intuition can align with modern geometric insights in cosmology. Shows remarkable similarities with quantum-level approaches in interpreting gravitational dynamics.

Conclusion: Shifting focus from spacetime as a static fabric to relational dynamics offers fresh insights into gravitational physics and cosmic structures, suggesting unity across classical and quantum interpretations.

Abstract: The geometric foundations of General Relativity are revisited, with
particular attention to its gauge invariance, as a key to understanding the
true nature of spacetime. Beyond the common image of spacetime as a deformable
'fabric' filling the Universe, curvature is interpreted as the dynamic
interplay between matter and interacting fields; a view already emphasized by
Einstein and Weyl, but sometimes overlooked in the literature. Building on
these tools, a Newtonian framework is reconstructed that captures essential
aspects of cosmology, showing how classical intuition can coexist with modern
geometric insights. This perspective shifts the focus from substance to
relationships, offering a fresh magnifying glass through which to reinterpret
gravitational dynamics and the large-scale structure of the Universe. The
similarities of this approach with other recent, more ambitious ones carried
out at the quantum level are quite remarkable.

### [44] [Quantum dynamics and thermodynamics of a Minkowski-Minkowski wormhole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13944)
*Johanna Borissova,João Magueijo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the path-integral quantization of a Lorentzian wormhole connecting two Minkowski spacetimes. Using the Israel junction condition formalism, it derives a non-local effective action governing the throat's dynamics. Topology-changing transitions are found to be suppressed by the Jacobi determinant. The authors also explore gravitational thermodynamics via Wick rotation, linking temperature and entropy to the shell's energy density and equation of state. They derive a thermodynamic first law from conservation equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand quantum effects in wormhole dynamics and thermal properties, addressing how topology changes are suppressed and establishing a thermodynamic framework for such spacetimes.

Method: Path-integral quantization with minisuperspace approximation, Israel junction conditions for dynamics, saddle-point approximation for propagator analysis, and Wick rotation to study thermodynamics using Euclidean effective actions.

Result: Topology changes are suppressed by Jacobi determinant in saddle-point analysis. Temperature and entropy linked to shell parameters via thermodynamic first law derived from conservation equations.

Conclusion: Wormhole quantum transitions are highly suppressed, and a consistent thermodynamic framework exists where shell properties determine gravitational temperature and entropy, supporting a first law analogy in this context.

Abstract: We consider the path-integral quantization of a minisuperspace cut-and-paste
Lorentzian wormhole connecting two Minkowski spacetimes. The dynamics of the
throat radius as a function of proper time is governed by a non-local effective
action derived by an application of the Israel junction condition formalism.
Within a saddle-point approximation of the propagator describing the evolution
from an initial to a final throat radius, we show that topology-changing
transitions are suppressed by the Jacobi determinant. In addition, we analyze
the gravitational thermodynamics of the wormhole spacetime by a Wick rotation
of the Israel-Lanczos equations in the presence of a thin-shell source. The
resulting Euclideanized field equations are assumed to originate from a
Euclidean effective gravity-matter action, which enters the path-integral
representation of the gravitational canonical partition function. Therefrom we
associate a temperature given by the inverse period of solutions, as well as a
gravitational entropy as functions of the surface energy density and equation
of state parameter of the shell. Both quantities are sourced entirely by the
discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature across the junction. We show how this
result can be applied to deduce a thermodynamic first law as the differential
version of the conservation equation relating the effective mass of the shell
to its surface pressure.

### [45] [The quasinormal mode content of binary black hole ringdown](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13954)
*Richard Dyer,Christopher J. Moore*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework to analyze quasinormal modes (QNMs) in high-accuracy gravitational waveforms from CCE simulations. It identifies QNM overtones, retrograde modes, and nonlinear modes up to cubic order, tabulates ringdown data across different start times, and confirms the absence of late-time power-law tails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a robust, data-driven method for extracting precise QNM information from gravitational wave data, which is crucial for testing general relativity and validating numerical relativity simulations.

Method: A fully Bayesian approach is applied to a public CCE waveform catalog. The method identifies QNMs, including overtones, retrograde modes, and nonlinear modes up to cubic order. It systematically tabulates ringdown mode content across various start times.

Result: The analysis successfully identifies the specified QNMs and confirms the absence of power-law tails in CCE waveforms. The tabulated data serves as a reference for future studies.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic reference for theoretical and observational studies, validating numerical simulations and enhancing understanding of gravitational wave physics.

Abstract: We present a fully Bayesian, data-driven framework for identifying
quasinormal modes in high-accuracy Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE)
gravitational waveforms. Applying this to a public catalog, we identify QNM
overtones, retrograde modes, and nonlinear modes up to cubic order in the
ringdown. The ringdown mode content is tabulated across a wide range of start
times for all available simulations, providing a systematic reference for
theoretical and observational studies. We also search for late-time power-law
tails, which are, as expected, absent from the CCE waveforms.

### [46] [Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957)
*Jan Heisig*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new interferometric design using closed optical loops to detect high-frequency gravitational waves, potentially surpassing the BBN sensitivity limit up to tens of kHz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors can't reach the BBN bound for stochastic gravitational waves at kilohertz frequencies, which could probe extremely high energy scales beyond the CMB. A new method is needed to access this unexplored regime.

Method: Closed optical loop interferometers with coherent phase accumulation over multiple traversals create narrowband resonances. Square/triangular loop configurations using Einstein Telescope-like infrastructure and ~500 finesse achieve enhanced sensitivity.

Result: Simulations show the proposed loop interferometers approach/surpass the BBN bound up to 10s of kHz after 1 year, offering a feasible path to detect high-frequency stochastic GW backgrounds.

Conclusion: This architecture provides a distinctive and realistic experimental approach to explore high-energy early Universe physics through gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe
of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic
microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV.
Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We
propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in
which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over
many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable
comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or
triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope
infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that
approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one
year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and
distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave
backgrounds.

### [47] [Transition-to-plunge self-force waveforms with a spinning primary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13958)
*Loïc Honet,Lorenzo Küchler,Adam Pound,Geoffrey Compère*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved waveform model for asymmetric-mass-ratio compact binary systems by incorporating the spin of the primary black hole and refining the transition phase between inspiral and merger phases using a variable transformation in phase space, validated against numerical relativity simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors require accurate waveform models covering both inspiral and merger phases. Existing self-force models focus on inspiral, neglecting the merger's significant contribution. Spin effects and smooth transitions between phases are critical for complete signal modeling.

Method: Generalized the next-to-next-to-leading-order transition-to-plunge waveform model to include primary black hole spin. Improved composite waveform construction via phase space variable transformation during transition-to-plunge. Validated with numerical relativity comparisons.

Result: Successful incorporation of primary spin into merger waveform models. Enhanced continuity between inspiral and merger phases through phase variable transformation. Quantitative agreement with numerical relativity simulations demonstrated.

Conclusion: The extended model provides a robust framework for gravitational-wave detection and parameter estimation, addressing gaps in previous models by including spin effects and improving phase transitions for asymmetric binaries.

Abstract: With the upcoming third-generation gravitational-wave detectors comes the
need to build complete, faithful, and fast waveform models for
asymmetric-mass-ratio compact binaries. Most efforts within the self-force
community have focused on modeling these binaries' inspiral regime, but for
ground-based detectors the systems' final merger can represent the dominant
part of the signal. Recent work by three of us has extended the multiscale
self-force framework through the transition-to-plunge and merger-ringdown
regimes for nonspinning binaries. In this paper, we generalize the
next-to-next-to-leading-order transition-to-plunge waveform model to include
the spin of the primary black hole. We also improve the construction of
composite inspiral-transition waveform models by performing a change of
variables on the binary's mechanical phase space during the transition to
plunge. We provide detailed discussions of our numerical implementation and
comparisons with numerical relativity simulations.

*Estuti Shukla,Alireza Rashti,Rossella Gamba,David Radice,Koustav Chandra*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces the second release of the GR-Athena++ waveform catalog, which includes four new high-resolution binary black hole simulations. These simulations are designed to meet the accuracy demands of next-generation gravitational wave detectors like LISA by extracting gravitational waves at future null infinity. The waveform accuracy is analyzed through convergence and self-mismatch studies, showing mismatches as low as 1e-7 for massive binaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop high-fidelity gravitational waveforms for next-generation detectors, ensuring they meet the stringent accuracy requirements of future observatories such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope.

Method: The method involves performing quasi-circular, non-precessing, spinning binary black hole simulations at high resolutions. Gravitational waves are extracted via Cauchy characteristic extraction and finite-radius methods. Convergence studies and self-mismatch analyses are conducted on strain data across resolutions.

Result: The results show maximum phase differences near merger (~1e-2) and smaller amplitude errors (~1e-3). Self-mismatch analyses for the (2,2) mode yield mismatches between 1e-5 and 1e-7 for 10^6 M☉ binaries over 0.002-0.1 Hz using LISA's noise curve.

Conclusion: The waveforms, publicly available on ScholarSphere, achieve precision competitive with detector requirements, marking progress toward enabling advanced gravitational wave astronomy for next-generation instruments.

Abstract: We present the second release of the $\texttt{GR-Athena++}$ waveform catalog,
comprising four new quasi-circular, non-precessing, spinning binary black hole
simulations. These simulations are performed at high resolutions and represent
a step toward generating high-fidelity gravitational waveforms that can
eventually meet the accuracy requirements of upcoming next-generation
detectors, including LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope.
Gravitational waves are extracted at future null infinity ( $\mathscr{I}^{+}$)
using both Cauchy characteristic extraction and finite-radius extraction. For
each simulation, we provide strain data across multiple resolutions and analyze
waveform accuracy via convergence studies and self-mismatch analyses. The
absolute phase and relative amplitude differences reach their largest values
near the merger, while the smallest errors are of order $\mathscr{O}(10^{-2})$
and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-3})$, respectively. A self-mismatch analysis of the
dominant $(2,2)$ mode yields mismatches between $\mathscr{O}(10^{-5})$ and
$\mathscr{O}(10^{-7})$ for a total binary mass of $10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the
frequency range $[0.002, 0.1]$ Hz using LISA noise curve. All waveforms are
publicly available via $\texttt{ScholarSphere}$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of
Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1
neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh
and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny
platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the
computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX
infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs,
running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We
validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results
obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with
simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state.
Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in
the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling
performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful
tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger
astrophysics.

### [50] [Boson Stars in $D \ge 4$ Dimensions: Stability, Oscillation Frequencies, and Dynamical Evolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13988)
*Gareth Arturo Marks,Abdullah Al Zaif*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper constructs spherically symmetric boson star solutions in 4, 5, and 6 dimensions with quartic self-interaction and solitonic potential. It demonstrates the existence of radially stable higher-dimensional solutions through perturbative analysis and nonlinear dynamical simulations, validating that perturbative stability implies nonlinear stability in spherical symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the stability properties of higher-dimensional boson stars and develop a numerical framework applicable to any number of dimensions while maintaining gauge freedom.

Method: 1. Constructed boson star solutions in D=4,5,6 with quartic self-interaction and solitonic potential. 2. Derived generalized pulsation equations for arbitrary dimensions and potentials. 3. Performed linear stability analysis. 4. Conducted nonlinear dynamical evolutions using a dimensionally reduced numerical framework preserving gauge freedom.

Result: Perturbatively stable solutions were confirmed to remain stable under nonlinear spherical perturbations. The numerical method successfully simulated spacetimes across dimensions without altering the gauge freedom.

Conclusion: Higher-dimensional boson stars with specific potentials can exhibit radially stable configurations, and perturbative stability analysis reliably predicts nonlinear stability in spherical symmetry. The developed numerical framework enables efficient study of multi-dimensional spacetimes in numerical relativity.

Abstract: We construct spherically symmetric boson star solutions in $D \in \{4,5,6\}$
spacetime dimensions, considering the effects of both a quartic
self-interaction term and a solitonic potential. We then perform a perturbative
analysis, generalizing the pulsation equations to arbitrary dimension and
potential and hence demonstrating the existence of radially stable
higher-dimensional boson star solutions. We supplement these linear results
with perturbed and unperturbed nonlinear dynamical evolutions in spherical
symmetry, obtained using a dimensional reduction that allows us to evolve
spacetimes with any number of background dimensions using the same numerical
framework, while preserving the full gauge freedom of standard approaches to
numerical relativity. The results of these evolutions indicate that the
solutions we identify as perturbatively stable are indeed generally stable to
nonlinear spherical dynamics.

*Wen-Cong Gan,Leila L. Graef,Rudnei O. Ramos,Gustavo S. Vicente,Anzhong Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that modified loop quantum cosmology model I (mLQC-I) naturally suppresses anisotropies through a quantum isotropization mechanism during the cosmic bounce, leading to a homogeneous and isotropic universe without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical cosmology in resolving cosmic singularities and the need for explaining the isotropy of the observed universe without fine-tuning.

Method: Analyzing the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in mLQC-I, focusing on shear suppression post-quantum bounce and its role in isotropization.

Result: mLQC-I resolves singularities via quantum bounces and exhibits rapid shear decay in the quantum regime, leading to an isotropic expansion post-bounce without dependence on collapsing matter fields.

Conclusion: mLQC-I provides a stronger mechanism for isotropization compared to other models, enhancing its credibility as a theory for the early universe.

Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum
cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for
isotropization. As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are
resolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature:
following the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to
zero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the
collapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization.
Consequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic
scales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the
quantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not
only resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for
suppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability
as a description of the early universe.

### [52] [The Instability of the Critical Friedmann Spacetime at the Big Bang as an Alternative to Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14228)
*Christopher Alexander,Blake Temple,Zeke Vogler*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the instability of pressureless Friedmann spacetimes against radial perturbations near the Big Bang, using self-similar variables to demonstrate that these spacetimes form an unstable saddle point. This instability naturally leads to accelerated expansion without dark energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the intrinsic instability of Friedmann spacetimes at the Big Bang and explore mechanisms for accelerated expansion alternative to dark energy or cosmological constants.

Method: The authors use self-similar variables (t, ξ=r/t) to reformulate Einstein-Euler equations, treating the critical k=0 Friedmann spacetime as a stationary solution. They analyze eigenvalues to show instability and study perturbations' evolution within the unstable manifold.

Result: Solutions smooth at the center align with Friedmann spacetimes at leading order in ξ. Generic underdense perturbations evolve into the family F (solutions matching k<0 Friedmann), which initially accelerate away from Friedmann but asymptotically return to the same leading-order behavior.

Conclusion: The inherent instability in Einstein-Euler equations provides a natural mechanism for accelerated cosmic expansion without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant.

Abstract: We characterize the local instability of pressureless Friedmann spacetimes to
radial perturbation at the Big Bang. The analysis is based on a formulation of
the Einstein-Euler equations in self-similar variables $(t,\xi)$, with
$\xi=r/t$, conceived to realize the critical ($k=0$) Friedmann spacetime as a
stationary solution whose character as an unstable saddle rest point $SM$ is
determined via an expansion of smooth solutions in even powers of $\xi$. The
eigenvalues of $SM$ imply the $k\neq0$ Friedmann spacetimes are unstable
solutions within the unstable manifold of $SM$. We prove that all solutions
smooth at the center of symmetry agree with a Friedmann spacetime at leading
order in $\xi$, and with an eye toward Cosmology, we focus on $\mathcal{F}$,
the set of solutions which agree with a $k<0$ Friedmann spacetime at leading
order, providing the maximal family into which generic underdense radial
perturbations of the unstable critical Friedmann spacetime will evolve. We
prove solutions in $\mathcal{F}$ generically accelerate away from Friedmann
spacetimes at intermediate times but decay back to the same leading order
Friedmann spacetime asymptotically as $t\to\infty$. Thus instabilities inherent
in the Einstein-Euler equations provide a natural mechanism for an accelerated
expansion without recourse to a cosmological constant or dark energy.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning approach using a variational autoencoder (VAE) and spectral clustering to classify glitch noise in KAGRA O3GK gravitational wave data, identifying eight distinct categories and aiding observatory improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glitch noise degrades gravitational wave observations; accurate classification is needed to enhance data analysis and detector sensitivity.

Method: Combined VAE for dimensionality reduction and spectral clustering for classification of glitch noise in KAGRA data.

Result: Eight distinct glitch noise categories identified, providing insights into KAGRA's O3GK operational characteristics.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning effectively classifies glitch noise, offering a pathway for interferometer upgrades and future observatory development.

Abstract: Gravitational wave interferometers are disrupted by various types of
nonstationary noise, referred to as glitch noise, that affect data analysis and
interferometer sensitivity. The accurate identification and classification of
glitch noise are essential for improving the reliability of gravitational wave
observations. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised
machine learning for classifying images with nonstationary noise in the KAGRA
O3GK data. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with spectral
clustering, we identified eight distinct glitch noise categories. The latent
variables obtained from VAE were dimensionally compressed, visualized in
three-dimensional space, and classified using spectral clustering to better
understand the glitch noise characteristics of KAGRA during the O3GK period.
Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised learning for efficient
glitch noise classification, which may in turn potentially facilitate
interferometer upgrades and the development of future third-generation
gravitational wave observatories.

### [54] [A unified model of dark energy and inflation from the Markov-Mukhanov action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14416)
*Hrishikesh Chakrabarty,Daniele Malafarina*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified model of dark energy and inflation using a modified Einstein-Hilbert action, where a scalar coupling function links matter to gravity. This function introduces UV corrections, enabling the dark energy component to act as the inflaton field during inflation. The model aligns with DESI data by having a dark energy equation of state parameter (w) slightly less than -1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify dark energy and inflation into a single framework addressing the shortcomings of the standard cosmological model. The standard model requires separate explanations for early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, suggesting a need for a more cohesive theory.

Method: The authors employ the Markov-Mukhanov modification to the Einstein-Hilbert action, introducing a scalar coupling function dependent on matter energy density. They derive the form of this coupling that allows the dark energy component to serve both as the inflaton and the late-time cosmic acceleration driver.

Result: The model successfully unifies inflation and dark energy dynamics. Key result is that the dark energy equation of state parameter w is near -1 but not exactly -1, aligning with DESI observational data.

Conclusion: A unified theory of dark energy and inflation is feasible through this modified gravity framework, offering a simpler cosmological model and resolving issues of fine-tuning. The findings support observational constraints indicating w ≈ -0.99, consistent with recent DESI measurements.

Abstract: We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the
Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter
sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on
the energy density of the matter content. We assume that the coupling function
encodes the UV corrections to the standard model of cosmology and we determine
the form of the coupling that allows for the dark energy component to be
dynamical and act as the inflaton field in the early universe. Interestingly we
show that our model, in order to account for inflation, prefers a dark energy
equation of state with $w$ close but not equal to $-1$ in agreement with the
latest DESI data.

TL;DR: Asymptotic Safety, a framework for quantum gravity via a renormalization group fixed point, is reviewed through its application to quantum-corrected black hole solutions. These solutions address classical general relativity's limitations, exploring their thermodynamics, evaporation, and dynamical features like quasinormal modes and shadows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the implications of Asymptotic Safety in quantum gravity by studying black holes, which experience extreme gravitational conditions and reveal gaps in classical general relativity. The motivation is to explore ultraviolet completeness without new degrees of freedom and to construct solutions that incorporate quantum corrections.

Method: The review examines quantum-corrected black hole solutions created through two methods: renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics and effective actions derived from coupling flow within Asymptotic Safety. It analyzes their structure, thermodynamics, evaporation, and dynamical aspects.

Result: The review summarizes existing solutions' properties, their thermodynamic behaviors, evaporation processes, and dynamic characteristics such as quasinormal modes and shadow features, highlighting how Asymptotic Safety addresses classical theory limitations.

Conclusion: Asymptotic Safety provides a promising avenue for quantum gravity by yielding viable black hole solutions that resolve classical singularities and discrepancies, with ongoing research needed to fully understand their dynamics and observational signatures.

Abstract: Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum
gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that
ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom.
Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of
this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight
the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of
quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the
Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of
classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of
couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We
discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their
thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal
modes and shadows.

TL;DR: The paper establishes transformation maps between three black hole parametrizations and determines the minimal parameters needed to accurately reproduce quasi-normal mode spectra, showing that a finite set of coefficients is sufficient across the frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify deviations from general relativity by comparing model-independent black hole descriptions and determining their parameter efficiency for observational data analysis.

Method: Constructing equivalence maps between Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description parametrizations. Testing with representative black hole geometries to find minimal parameters for accurate quasi-normal mode spectra.

Result: A finite number of parameters in each framework achieves desired precision for the observables. Each parametrization has complementary strengths in probing black hole physics.

Conclusion: These parametrizations provide effective tools for testing general relativity, and their combined use can enhance understanding of black hole properties through complementary aspects.

Abstract: A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract
model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes
from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity.
In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the
equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime
patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric
Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine
the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the
associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our
analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients
suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we
emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be
exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study explores Klein-Gordon bosons/antibosons in a Bonnor-Melvin spacetime with a uniform magnetic field and rainbow gravity corrections under a positive cosmological constant. The authors find radial wavefunctions and energy spectra, observe state collapse for m≠0 onto m=0 levels, and show magnetic field effects on spatial localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how spacetime curvature, magnetic fields, cosmological constants, and quantum gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum systems in confined geometries.

Method: Solved the Klein-Gordon equation in Bonnor-Melvin spacetime using rainbow gravity models (Magueijo-Smolin and LQG-based) leading to hypergeometric differential equations. Derived analytical energy spectra and wavefunctions with quantum number dependencies.

Result: Closed-form hypergeometric solutions showed planck-scale bounded spectra, magnetic field-induced spatial localization into rings, and cosmological constant effects reducing state degeneracy. Unique quantum degeneracy of m states only in curved magnetized spacetime.

Conclusion: Gravitational confinement, topology, magnetic fields, and Planck-scale corrections collectively control relativistic quantum field properties in curved and magnetized backgrounds.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of Klein-Gordon (KG) scalar bosons and
antibosons confined in the Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime under a uniform
magnetic field, incorporating rainbow gravity (RG) corrections with a positive
cosmological constant. The cosmological constant partitions spacetime into an
infinite sequence of confinement domains bounded by impenetrable barriers.
Within the first allowed domain, the KG equation reduces to a hypergeometric
differential equation, yielding closed-form expressions for both the energy
spectra and the radial wavefunctions in terms of hypergeometric polynomials.
Two representative RG models, inspired by the Magueijo-Smolin framework and
loop quantum gravity (LQG), produce Planck-scale bounded, symmetric
particle-antiparticle spectra. A distinctive feature of the curved magnetized
geometry is the collapse of all magnetic quantum states $m \neq 0$ onto the $m
= 0$ level for each radial excitation, a degeneracy absent in flat spacetime.
Increasing the cosmological constant partially lifts this collapse,
establishing a direct link between the global spacetime curvature and the local
quantum structure. Radial probability density analysis further shows that
stronger magnetic fields enhance spatial localization, confining bosons into
static or rotating ring-like configurations with nodal architectures that
evolve systematically with quantum numbers. These findings reveal how
gravitational confinement, topology, magnetic fields, and Planck-scale
corrections jointly govern the spectral and spatial properties of relativistic

### [58] [Non-exotic traversable wormholes with strong deflection angle in King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos under f(R,Lm) gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14833)
*Susmita Sarkar,Nayan Sarkar,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Farook Rahaman*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This study explores traversable wormholes in f(R, L_m) gravity within dark matter halos, showing they can be supported by non-exotic matter with observable lensing effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether non-exotic traversable wormholes can exist in asymptotically flat spacetimes within dark matter halos using modified gravity theories, and to understand their observational signatures.

Method: Two f(R, L_m) models are analyzed with King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter profiles. Solutions are derived, energy conditions checked, and physical properties like embedding surfaces and lensing effects studied.

Result: Wormhole geometries with non-exotic matter are viable in these models. Parameters choices allow consistent structures with detectable gravitational lensing signatures.

Conclusion: Modified gravity coupled with dark matter allows physically viable wormholes, offering new astrophysical observation avenues and insights into gravity-dark matter interactions.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate asymptotically flat non-exotic traversable
wormhole geometries within the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos in the
framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity. Two functional forms of the theory are
considered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R,
L_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are
obtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density
profiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution
influences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to
verify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic
matter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total
gravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole's physical
viability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and
its implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational
signatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within
$f(R, L_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter
environments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole
geometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new
insights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and
astrophysical observations.

### [59] [Dynamic SBI: Round-free Sequential Simulation-Based Inference with Adaptive Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13997)
*Huifang Lyu,James Alvey,Noemi Anau Montel,Mauro Pieroni,Christoph Weniger*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Dynamic Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) is introduced as an asynchronous, round-free method that enhances simulation efficiency and parallelization in high-dimensional scientific inference, validated on astrophysical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiencies and sequential nature of traditional round-based SBI methods, which are resource-intensive for high-dimensional physics problems with large data volumes.

Method: Dynamic SBI uses an adaptive dataset iteratively transformed to match target observations. Simulations and neural network training run in parallel, using trained models to filter incompatible simulations and propose new ones, eliminating the need for fixed rounds.

Result: Dynamic SBI reduces simulation costs and training overhead while maintaining accuracy. It successfully handles challenging astrophysical tasks like stochastic gravitational wave background characterization and gravitational lensing analysis.

Conclusion: The method offers a flexible, efficient paradigm for SBI, particularly suited for complex, high-dimensional problems in physics, enabling scalable inference with improved resource management.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm
for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the
representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most
informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI
methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process
towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically
implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network
training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well
suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are
commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing
model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas
of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable
manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed
during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training
proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations
incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to
round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly
reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI
achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while
maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two
challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic
gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing
systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for
sequential SBI.

### [60] [Extracting latent representations from X-ray spectra. Classification, regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14102)
*Nicolò Oreste Pinciroli Vago,Juan Rafael Martínez-Galarza,Roberta Amato*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transformer-based autoencoder to create a compact and physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra, demonstrating its effectiveness through classification, regression, and interpretability analyses. The model achieves high spectral reconstruction accuracy, moderate classification performance, and latent features correlating with physical properties like N_H and hardness ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) contains extensive X-ray spectral data that is underexplored with machine learning. The aim is to develop a method to extract meaningful representations from these spectra for better understanding astrophysical sources.

Method: A transformer-based autoencoder is used to compress X-ray spectra from the CSC. The input spectra are high-significance detections. The method evaluates learned representations via spectral reconstruction, clustering (for 8 source classes), and correlation analysis with physical quantities (e.g., hardness ratios, N_H).

Result: The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with only 8 latent variables. Clustering in latent space yields ~40% balanced accuracy across 8 classes, rising to ~69% for AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects. Latent features correlate with non-linear flux combinations and physical properties.

Conclusion: The autoencoder-based approach effectively captures physically relevant information in X-ray spectra, enabling compact representation useful for classification and estimating physical properties. This highlights deep learning's potential in X-ray spectral analysis and pattern discovery.

Abstract: The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of
astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and
informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source
Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains
largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and
physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep
learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant
information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and
interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress
X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only
high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary
statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned
representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering
performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with
physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density
($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent
variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification
accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when
restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover,
latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes,
suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant
information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the
representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent
space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical
properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral
studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.

### [61] [Polarisation Performance of Offset Phase Antennas: A Study for FARSIDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14178)
*Nivedita Mahesh,Judd D Bowman,Bharat Gehlot,Danny Jacobs*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper examines how antenna phase offsets from rover deployment affect the polarization response and imaging performance of the FARSIDE lunar radio array, showing significant increases in Stokes V leakage that require correction for accurate exoplanet ECM emission detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment method using tele-operated rovers may introduce phase offsets between orthogonal antenna pairs, which could degrade polarization measurements critical for detecting ECM emissions from exoplanets.

Method: Modeling FARSIDE's dipole beams with/without phase offsets, simulating visibilities/images using GLEAM sky model, analyzing Muller matrix terms and Stokes parameters.

Result: Phase offsets cause increased Stokes V/I flux ratio (2.5% vs 0.05%) and additional leakages into Stokes U/V via Muller matrix terms, necessitating correction for high-fidelity polarization measurements.

Conclusion: Antenna phase offsets severely impact FARSIDE's polarization accuracy, requiring precise deployment or advanced calibration techniques to ensure reliable detection of exoplanetary ECM signals.

Abstract: Several radio telescopes have been planned or proposed to be deployed on the
Lunar farside in the coming years. These will observe the unexplored ultra-long
wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum from the lunar farside's unique
radio-quiet and ionosphere-free environment. One such lunar radio array is the
NASA-funded concept - the Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the
Dark Ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE). FARSIDE will operate over 100~kHz to 40~MHz
with 128 spatially non-co-located orthogonal pairs of antenna nodes distributed
over a 12 X 12 km area in a four-arm spiral configuration. Being on the lunar
farside, this radio interferometer will be deployed by tele-operated rovers.
The rover deployment mode could lead to a phase offset between each of the two
orthogonally polarised antenna elements in the array, which are typically
co-located. In this paper, we quantify the effects of such antenna phase
offsets on the polarisation response and imaging performance of the lunar radio
array. Modelling and analysing the FARSIDE dipole beams with and without
offset, we find the latter leads to additional leakages into Stokes U and V
corresponding to Muller matrix terms of M2(0,1,2,3) and M3(0,1,2,3). Using a
custom simulation pipeline to incorporate all four Stokes beams of spatially
co-located and non-co-located dipoles, we produce visibilities and simulated
images for the GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA) sky model through
the FARSIDE array. We find that for a pure Stokes I input sky, the output image
maximum Stokes V/I flux ratio for the offset case has increased to 2.5% versus
0.05% for the co-located case. The additional Stokes V needs to be corrected
since the detection of Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) emissions from exoplanets
requires high-fidelity Stokes V measurements.

*Edgar P. Vidal,Alexander T. Gagliano,Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical simulation-based inference model using transformers and flow-matching to classify and characterize multi-band light curves of astronomical transients, achieving high accuracy in component identification and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational challenges in analyzing millions of transients from surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, while capturing multi-component energy sources and enabling efficient spectroscopic follow-up.

Method: The model uses a transformer-based light curve summarizer, flow-matching regression, and a categorical classifier. Trained on ~150k synthetic light curves from MOSFiT, it identifies energy sources, infers physical properties of subclasses, and detects anomalies via latent space analysis.

Result: 90% classification accuracy for energy sources, well-calibrated posteriors for active components, and successful detection of rare anomalies like TDEs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable framework for population studies of known transients and discovery of novel populations in upcoming large surveys.

Abstract: Time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are projected to
annually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary
programs demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of
the most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional
approaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and
ignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In
this work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for
multi-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event
of interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3)
separates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture
consists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a
flow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical
components. We train and test our model on $\sim$150k synthetic light curves
generated with $\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification
accuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for
all active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption
events (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a
scalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the
discovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin.

Abstract: The South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM) is a
millimeter-wavelength line-intensity mapping experiment, which was deployed on
the South Pole Telescope (SPT) during the 2024-2025 Austral summer season. This
pathfinder experiment serves to demonstrate the on-sky operation of multi-pixel
on-chip spectrometer technology. We report on the cryogenic performance of the
SPT-SLIM receiver for the first year of commissioning observations. The
SPT-SLIM receiver utilizes an Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) for
cooling the focal plane of superconducting filterbank spectrometers to a
temperature of 150 mK. We demonstrate stable thermal performance of the focal
plane module during observations consistent with thermal modeling, enabling a
cryogenic operating efficiency above 80%. We also report on the receiver
control system design utilizing the Observatory Control System (OCS) platform
for automated cryogenic operation on the SPT.

TL;DR: This paper describes the methodology and results of calibrating the on-sky responsivity for the SPT-SLIM instrument during its initial deployment, ensuring accurate measurements through atmospheric and detector response analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a reliable calibration for detector responses to sky loading under varying conditions, essential for valid line intensity mapping experiments.

Method: The team used periodic elevation-dependent detector measurements, atmospheric opacity data from a tipping radiometer, simulated atmospheric spectra, and measured detector spectral responses to build a responsivity model. They calibrated moon observations against the known lunar brightness temperature.

Result: The calibration model successfully validated using lunar observations, cross-checked with established lunar brightness data, confirming the method's accuracy under South Pole atmospheric conditions.

Conclusion: The calibration framework ensures reliable responsivity estimates for SPT-SLIM, enabling robust cosmic signal analysis in future line intensity mapping studies.

Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the on-sky responsivity calibration
of the South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM).
SPT-SLIM is a pathfinder line intensity mapping experiment utilizing the
on-chip spectrometer technology, and was first deployed during the 2024-2025
Austral Summer season on the South Pole Telescope. During the two-week on-sky
operation of SPT-SLIM, we performed periodic measurements of the detector
response as a function of the telescope elevation angle. Combining these data
with atmospheric opacity measurements from an on-site atmospheric tipping
radiometer, simulated South Pole atmospheric spectra, and measured detector
spectral responses, we construct estimates for the responsivity of SPT-SLIM
detectors to sky loading. We then use this model to calibrate observations of
the moon taken by SPT-SLIM, cross-checking the result against the known
brightness temperature of the Moon as a function of its phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the suitability of CMOS cameras, specifically the Marana 4.2BV-11, for high-precision photometry through laboratory testing.

Method: Laboratory characterization of the camera in FFR and HDR modes, measuring parameters like read noise, dark current, photo response, quantum efficiency, and linearity across visible spectrum.

Result: FFR mode: 1.577 e⁻ read noise, 2366 e⁻pix⁻¹ well capacity, linearity error 0.099%. HDR mode: 1.571 e⁻ read noise, 69026 e⁻pix⁻¹ well capacity, 93 dB dynamic range, linearity error 0.122%, with minimal non-uniformities and high quantum efficiency (peak >95% at 560 nm).

Conclusion: The camera meets standards for precise photometry, offering advantages in speed, dynamic range, and sensitivity in astronomical applications.

Abstract: Scientific CMOS cameras are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern
observational astronomy. We assess the ability of CMOS image sensors technology
to perform high-precision photometry with a detailed laboratory
characterization of the Marana 4.2BV-11 CMOS camera. We characterise the camera
in the Fastest Frame Rate (FFR) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) modes. Our
evaluation includes read noise, dark current, photo response and dark signal
non-uniformities, quantum efficiency and window transmittance. The read noise
is found to be 1.577\,e$^-$ for the FFR mode. For the HDR mode the read noise
floor is measured to be 1.571\,e$^-$ for signal levels below approximately
1800\,e$^-$. The bias level shows dark signal non-uniformities with values of
0.318\,e$^-$ and 0.232\,e$^-$ for FFR and HDR mode, respectively. Pixel well
capacity reached 2366 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ for the FFR mode and 69026
e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ with a dynamic range of 93\,dB for the HDR mode. The camera
demonstrates good linearity, yielding linearity errors of 0.099\,\% for FFR
mode and 0.122\,\% for HDR mode. The uniformity across the image arrays show a
photo response non-uniformity of 0.294\,\% for the FFR mode and 0.131\,\% for
the HDR mode. The dark current displays a noticeable glow pattern, resulting in
mean dark current levels of $1.674\pm0.011$\, \eps\, for the FFR mode and
$1.617\pm0.008$\,\eps\, for the HDR mode at a constant temperature of
-25\,$^\circ$C. We measured the quantum efficiency across the visible spectrum,
with a peak of of >95\,\% at 560\,nm. Our tests indicate that the Marana CMOS
camera is potentially capable of performing precise photometry.

Abstract: The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) SETI Committee has long
provided guiding principles for responding to a potential detection of a SETI
signal. The foundational Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities
Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, first formulated in
1989, has been widely recognised by the international scientific community. A
supplemental set of draft protocols addressing the possibility of a reply to an
extraterrestrial signal was prepared in 1995 by the IAA SETI Permanent
Committee, with both documents presented in a position paper to the UN
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 2000. In keeping with the
evolving landscape of SETI research, the IAA Declaration of Principles was
streamlined and updated in 2010. Recognising the need for continued adaptation,
the IAA SETI Committee established a Task Group in 2022 to re-examine the
protocols in light of recent advances in search methodologies, the expansion of
international participation in SETI, and the increasing complexity of the
global information environment. The Group recognises the living document nature
of the protocols, which will require ongoing refinement to remain relevant and
effective in a rapidly changing world. A draft revised Declaration of
Principles was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was
received from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee.
Since then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured
process, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and
consultations. A Revised Declaration of Principles, is presented here.

*Zhongnan Dong,Bin Ma,Haoran Zhang,Jinji Li,Xu Yang,Yi Hu,Zhaohui Shang,Michael C. B. Ashley*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT), designed to explore the dynamic infrared sky at Dome A using two InGaAs cameras. It highlights the camera's performance characteristics, on-sky tests, and initial observational capabilities, demonstrating significant potential for infrared time-domain surveys in an extreme environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared time-domain surveys lag behind optical counterparts due to limited infrastructure. The motivation is to leverage Dome A's optimal infrared conditions and cost-effective InGaAs technology to fill this observational gap, enabling studies of transient and variable phenomena in the infrared spectrum.

Method: AIRBT uses two 15 cm f/3 telescopes with InGaAs cameras (J and H bands). The study includes lab characterization (bias, readout noise, dark current, nonlinearity, photon transfer curves) and on-sky tests (calibration, limiting magnitudes, photometric precision) conducted in 2022. Data analysis compares InGaAs performance with CCDs, addressing temperature dependencies and noise characteristics.

Result: Key results include 5σ limiting magnitudes of J=11.2 and H=9.7 in 3s exposures, sub-percent photometric precision via stacking, and identification of InGaAs-specific noise behaviors. On-sky tests validated system performance, with AIRBT operational since early 2023 at Dome A.

Conclusion: AIRBT provides a cost-effective platform for infrared time-domain surveys at Dome A, offering unprecedented capabilities in transient detection. Findings underscore InGaAs cameras' potential for future Antarctic observatories, addressing technical challenges and paving the way for expanded infrared sky monitoring.

Abstract: Infrared time-domain surveys remain significantly underdeveloped compared
with their optical counterparts. We have developed the Antarctic Infrared
Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) to study the dynamic infrared sky at Dome A,
Antarctica, taking advantage of the superb infrared observational conditions at
this site. AIRBT consists of two identical 15 cm f/3 optical tube assemblies
and two cost-effective indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) cameras equipped with J
and H filters, respectively. The cameras have 640 x 512 pixels with a size of
15 micrometers, providing a scale of 6.9 arcseconds per pixel and a field of
view of 1.22 x 0.97 square degrees. We characterize the performance of the
InGaAs cameras, including bias, readout noise, dark current, nonlinearity, and
photon transfer curve. Our analysis highlights the distinct behaviors of InGaAs
cameras compared with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The bias and readout noise
show temperature dependence, and the noise measured from the photon transfer
curves has additional components that increase with exposure time. On-sky tests
were conducted in October 2022 including system calibration, limiting depth,
and photometric precision. For a single 3-second exposure, we achieved 5-sigma
limiting magnitudes of 11.2 mag (Vega system) in J band and 9.7 mag in H band.
The best photometric precision reached 20 millimagnitudes at the bright end,
which could be further improved to sub-percent levels through image stacking.
AIRBT was installed at Dome A in January 2023, and scientific observations
began as soon as darkness set in.
