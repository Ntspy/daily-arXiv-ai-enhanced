Similarly, EWP diagrams are related\nto tree diagrams. These SU(3)$_F$ EWP-tree relations were recently used in\nglobal analyses of $B \\to PP$ decays. They have also been used over the years\nin analyses of the $B \\to \\pi K$ puzzle, even though the $B \\to \\pi K$\namplitudes are related by isospin symmetry [SU(2)$_I$], and not the full\nSU(3)$_F$. In this paper, we show that, even if only SU(2)$_I$ is assumed,\nthere are still EWP-tree relations. In $\\Delta S=0$ decays, these relations are\nsimilar to those of SU(3)$_F$, and can be used to take into account the EWP\ncontributions in the extraction of the CP phase $\\alpha$ from $B \\to \\pi\\pi$\ndecays. In $\\Delta S=1$ decays, the SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations are quite\ndifferent from those of SU(3)$_F$; when these are used to analyze the $B \\to\n\\pi K$ puzzle, one now finds a 4-5$\\sigma$ discrepancy with the SM, much larger\nthan what was previously found.

To maintain realism for\nsecular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in\nconserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent\ntransport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also\ncrucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis\nsingularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break\nflux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant\ndrifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that\nmaintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation\nof the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare\nthe numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations\nwhen evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS\nmerger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis\nsmoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum\nconservation of other conservative methods on $\\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of\nviscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in\nthe remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving\nthe entropy density.

Glozman"], "title": "Chiral spin symmetry", "comment": "14 pages. Article commissioned by Encyclopedia of Nuclear Physics", "summary": "We review the chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of the color charge\nand of the confining electric part of QCD. Observation of this symmetry in the\nvacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies\nthat the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark\ncondensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are\nnot directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry\nrestoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with\nchirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining\nelectric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature\nT_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears\nsuggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a\nvery smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has\nbeen further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy\ndensity, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as\nN_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We\nhave analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above\nT_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid.\nWhen N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the\nthree-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally\nsymmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry\nrestoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet\nquark-antiquark systems that become very large at T > T_ch. Consequently the\nstringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the\noverlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark \"mesons\" with a very small\nmean free path."}

Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly\nsampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous\npaper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power\nlaw power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56\nvariable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the\n$0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends\nin 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We\nalso find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We\nupdate the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements\nspanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends\nin the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H\n1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279."}

A distinctive feature of the curved magnetized\ngeometry is the collapse of all magnetic quantum states $m \\neq 0$ onto the $m\n= 0$ level for each radial excitation, a degeneracy absent in flat spacetime.\nIncreasing the cosmological constant partially lifts this collapse,\nestablishing a direct link between the global spacetime curvature and the local\nquantum structure.

Rubin Observatory are projected to\nannually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary\nprograms demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of\nthe most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional\napproaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and\nignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In\nthis work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for\nmulti-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event\nof interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3)\nseparates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture\nconsists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a\nflow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical\ncomponents. We train and test our model on $\\sim$150k synthetic light curves\ngenerated with $\\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification\naccuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for\nall active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a\nscalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the\ndiscovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin."}

Adding new, light particles to\n  the field content of the SM, such as right-handed neutrinos, allows\n  to construct operators for invisible neutron decay at much lower\n  dimensions. Observing invisible neutron decay, if nucleon decays\n  with charged leptons remain absent, would therefore point towards the\n  existence of new neutral degrees of freedom. Here, we discuss four\n  cases: (i) Adding right-handed neutrinos to the SM; (ii) a\n  right-handed neutrino and an axion-like particle; (iii) a\n  right-handed neutrino and a (nearly) massless singlet scalar; and\n  (iv) a right-handed neutrino and a light $Z'$. We give the general\n  tree-level decomposition for the resulting $d=(7-9)$ operators for\n  invisible neutron decay. We also briefly discuss LHC searches\n  related to the exotic states found in these UV completions."}

We then examine several observational constraints on the ALP-electron\nand ALP-muon parameter spaces.

Our results provide updated and robust constraints on ALP couplings to\nelectrons and muons from an improved treatment of production and absorption\nprocesses. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties of the results by using\nthree state-of-the-art supernova models based on two independent simulation\ncodes, finding that constraints vary by factors of O(2-10)."}

Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature:\nfollowing the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to\nzero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the\ncollapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization.\nConsequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic\nscales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the\nquantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not\nonly resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for\nsuppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability\nas a description of the early universe."}
