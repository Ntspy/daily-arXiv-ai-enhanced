Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation.

Despite their importance, most studies to date on core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have focused primarily on the effects of electron captures, generally neglecting $\u03b2$ decay contributions. In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $\u03b2$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $\u03b2$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation.

Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation.
