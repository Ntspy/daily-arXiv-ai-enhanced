Comments welcome", "summary": "Many asymmetric dark matter scenarios have been proposed to date. Among them, perhaps the most motivated ones are those in which the dark matter asymmetry is induced from the baryon/lepton asymmetries via chemical equilibration without any new sources of CP violation. However, most of the models put forward along these lines have been excluded by now and/or are based on complicated setups. In this letter, we present a new, simple, and viable scenario. It assumes only two new fields: a scalar singlet and an inert scalar doublet, and is based only on renormalizable interactions, that slowly generate the dark matter asymmetry from the Standard Model Higgs asymmetry. The model allows for the direct detection of dark matter in the upcoming generation of experiments, and the inert doublet is predicted to be light enough to be potentially produced and observed at the LHC and future colliders, $m_{H'}<580\\,{\\rm GeV}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, accurately grouping and linking a researcher's entire body of work with their individual identity is challenging because of widespread name ambiguity across the growing literature. Algorithmic author name disambiguation provides a scalable approach to disambiguating author identities, yet existing methods have limitations. Many modern author name disambiguation methods rely on comprehensive metadata features such as venue or affiliation. Despite advancements in digitally indexing publications, metadata is often unavailable or inconsistent in large digital libraries(e.g. NASA/ADS). We introduce the Neural Author Name Disambiguator, a method that disambiguates author identities in large digital libraries despite limited metadata availability. We formulate the disambiguation task as a similarity learning problem by employing a Siamese neural network to disambiguate author names across publications relying solely on widely available publication metadata-author names, titles and abstracts. We construct the Large-Scale Physics ORCiD Linked dataset to evaluate the Neural Author Name Disambiguator by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications ORCiD. By leveraging foundation models to embed metadata into features, our model achieves up to 94% accuracy in pairwise disambiguation and over 95% F1 in clustering publications into their researcher identities. We release the testing dataset as a benchmark for physics and astronomy, providing realistic evaluation conditions for future disambiguation methods.

Significant continuum polarization indicates that the photosphere exhibited a global departure from spherical symmetry at the level of 10%-40% at the earliest times (days 0--40), which decreased to 0%-20% by days 57--90. During the early photospheric phase, the ejecta maintained a near-constant orientation of 12\u00b0-20\u00b0 on the sky, as shown by the dominant axis in the Stokes q-u plane. Polarization signatures in the Fe II \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb4924, 5018, 5169 lines shared this axis. Meanwhile, high levels of polarization associated with the He I lines traced distinct q-u loops with a dramatic rotation away from the dominant axis, indicating that the early-time ejecta were also characterized by hot, fast, helium-rich material concentrated near the poles. At day 295, during the transition to the nebular phase, a new, highly elongated structure became prominent in the ejecta, with an axis orthogonal to the dominant axis that defined the photospheric phase.

In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, it is expected that they underwent a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal mass ratios, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to either a stellar merger or a final binary with a very short orbital period. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. With the aid of detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether fully non-conservative mass transfer, where mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two of the Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from the standard isotropic re-emission model, which assumes mass loss from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss model, without the need for fine-tuning, reproduces the observed orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well across a wide range of initial conditions. This scenario, therefore, offers a plausible formation pathway for these systems. We speculate that orbital widening during mass loss could result from the unequal Roche-lobe sizes of the components and eruptive mass loss driven by the donor's high-opacity subsurface layers.

Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a ~480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3.

We measure the properties of key emission features, namely those at 6300, 7300, and 7774 angstroms (associated with [O I], [Ca II]/[O II], and O I, respectively), and find that SLSNe exhibit much wider spectral diversity than normal SNe Ic, primarily in the line ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, which is highly sensitive to ejecta ionization. Some events exhibit weak [O I] and a clear [O II] contribution to the 7300 angstrom feature, enhancing the ratio, along with [O III] lines at 4363 and 5007 angstroms.

The ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ is also correlated with the rise and decline times of the light curves, with slower events exhibiting higher ionization, the first robust connection between early light curve and late-time spectral properties, likely due to the magnetar's impact: slower-evolving SLSNe are generally powered by engines with longer spin-down timescales, which deposit more energy at later phases.

In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a \"dark photosphere\" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space.

Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\u03a9=200$ Hz.

The implementation of the framework usually requires the presence of a third, heavier state, which plays the role of dark matter and ensures the couplings run so that the multi-phase criticality condition is met. In this paper we consider the multi-phase criticality limit of an extension of the Standard Model including two extra scalar singlets, addressing the scenario with effective field theory methods that are particularly suited for treating the hierarchical mass spectrum that this construction yields.

Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray--only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane.
