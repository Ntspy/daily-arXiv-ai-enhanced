A promising model for QPEs is the star-disc collisions model, where a star repeatedly interacts with an accretion disc around a black hole, creating shocks that expel dense outflows of gas from which radiation emerges. We investigate the dynamics of the star-disc collisions, the properties of the outflows, and the resulting radiation signatures. Our study focuses on the generic case where the star remains unperturbed by the collision and the stellar crossing time through the disc is sufficiently long for shocked gas to flow around the star. We performed a three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the star-disc collision. The star was modeled as a solid, spherical body, and the interaction was simulated for a small, local section of the accretion disc. We found that star-disc collisions generate a nearly paraboloidal bow shock. The heating of gas is not confined to the column of gas directly ahead of the star but also extends laterally as the shock front expands sideways while traveling with the star. As the star crosses the disc, it injects momentum preferentially along its direction of motion, leading to an asymmetric redistribution of energy and momentum. As a result, two outflows emerge on opposite sides of the disc with different properties: the forward outflow expands faster, contains more mass, carries more energy, and is about twice as luminous as the backward outflow. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry in outflow properties and luminosity arises naturally from the collision dynamics, offering a possible explanation for the alternating strong-weak flare patterns observed in several QPE sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores how star-disc collisions near supermassive black holes can generate quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), using 3D simulations to show asymmetric outflows and radiation signatures that match observed flare patterns.", "motivation": "To understand the mechanism behind QPEs, which are mysterious X-ray burst events near black holes, by testing the star-disc collision model.", "method": "Performed 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of a star passing through an accretion disc, modeling the star as a solid sphere and focusing on a local disc region.", "result": "Simulations revealed paraboloidal bow shocks, asymmetric forward/backward outflows (forward outflow being more massive, luminous, and energetic), and lateral heating effects, explaining alternating flare strengths.", "conclusion": "Star-disc collisions naturally produce asymmetric luminous outflows, supporting them as a candidate mechanism for QPEs' repeating burst patterns."}}

This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones.

To meet the spacecraft's constraints on computational resources and telemetry bandwidth, the near-infrared signal is processed onboard via a dedicated hardware-software architecture designed to fulfil the stringent Euclid's data-quality requirements. A custom application software, running on the two NISP data processing units, implements the NISP signal estimator: an ad-hoc algorithm which delivers accurate flux measurements and simultaneously estimates the quality of signal estimation through the quality factor parameter. This paper investigates the properties of the NISP signal estimator by evaluating its performance during the early flight operations of the NISP instrument. First, we revisit the assumptions on which the inference of the near-infrared signal is based and investigate the origin of the main systematics of the signal estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. Then, we test the flight performance of the NISP signal estimator. Results indicate a systematic bias lower than 0.01 e/s for 99% of the NISP pixel array, well within the noise budget of the estimated signal. We also derive an analytical expression for the variance of the NISP signal estimator, demonstrating its validity, particularly when the covariance matrix is not pre-computed. Finally, we provide a robust statistical framework to interpret the QF parameter, analyse its dependence on the signal estimator bias, and show its sensitivity to cosmic ray hits on NISP detectors. Our findings corroborate previous results on the NISP signal estimator and suggest a leading-order correction based on the agreement between flight data and simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper evaluates the performance of the NISP signal estimator onboard the Euclid spacecraft during early flight operations, demonstrating its accuracy and providing a statistical framework for interpreting the quality factor parameter.", "motivation": "To verify the NISP signal estimator's compliance with Euclid's data-quality requirements, assess systematics, and validate its statistical properties under real flight conditions.", "method": "Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate systematic biases.

SN 2024aecx is a peculiar SN Ic that exhibited luminous shock-cooling emission at early times, suggestive of close-in circumstellar medium (CSM), unexpected for this class of SNe. Its early NIR spectra are typical for a SN Ic but with strong CI absorption features. By ~32 days post peak, the spectra show a strong NIR excess, while maintaining normal optical colors, unprecedented for SNe Ic. We find that the NIR excess is well fit with a single-temperature, optically thin dust model with declining temperature, increasing mass, and roughly constant luminosity over time. The NIR excess appears too promptly for dust to have formed in the SN ejecta, indicating an IR echo from pre-existing dust in the CSM. The IR echo is likely powered by the relatively slowly evolving SN peak light, and not the brief shock cooling emission, as the latter requires unrealistically high CSM densities to explain the observed dust mass. We consider different potential CSM geometries and find that a thick face-on disk with an inner edge around $5\\times 10^{16}$ cm can best explain the dust mass and temperature evolution.

We investigate the physical origin of the observed variability quantitatively, focusing on the effects of resonant scattering and Doppler shift induced by the plasma flow in the accretion funnel. We developed a relativistic Monte Carlo code to perform detailed radiative transfer calculations in the accretion funnel above the hotspot and derive angle-dependent spectra. Analytical plasma density and velocity profiles were adopted to account for the effects of radiation pressure on the flow. Approximate resonant scattering cross-sections were employed. We varied the accretion luminosity to explore the resulting variability of the CRSF properties. The emergent spectra exhibit a prominent, asymmetric CRSF accompanied by a broad blue wing.

In recent years, the SMT channel has received significant attention due to detailed binary models showing increased mass transfer stability compared to previous studies. In this work, we perform a full zero-age-main-sequence to compact object merger analysis using detailed binary models at eight metallicities between $10^{-4}Z_\\odot$ and $2Z_\\odot$ to self-consistently model the population properties of BBH mergers in the SMT channel, determined their progenitor initial conditional, and investigate the binary physics governing their formation and metallicity dependence. We use the population synthesis code POSYDON to determine the population of BBH mergers from SMT. Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z>0.2Z_\\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss.
