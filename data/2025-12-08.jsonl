Comments welcome", "summary": "A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($Δx < H_{\\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($Δx \\ll H_{\\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($Δx \\gg H_{\\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors."}

Observational strategies for these early EM searches are therefore critical, yet current practice remains suboptimal, motivating improved, coordination-aware approaches. We propose and evaluate the Two-Step Localization strategy, a coordinated observational protocol in which one wide-field auxiliary telescope and one narrow-field main telescope monitor the evolving GW sky localization in real time. The auxiliary telescope, by virtue of its large field of view, has a higher probability of detecting early EM emission. Upon registering a candidate signal, it triggers the main telescope to slew to the inferred location for prompt, high-resolution follow-up. We assess the performance of Two-Step Localization using large-scale simulations that incorporate dynamic sky-map updates, realistic telescope parameters, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-weighted localization contours. For context, we compare Two-Step Localization to two benchmark strategies lacking coordination. Our results demonstrate that Two-Step Localization significantly reduces the median detection latency, highlighting the effectiveness of targeted cooperation in the early-time discovery of EM counterparts. Our results point to the most impactful next step: next-generation faster telescopes that deliver drastically higher slew rates and shorter scan times, reducing the number of required tiles; a deeper, truly wide-field auxiliary improves coverage more than simply adding more telescopes."}

Although most of the accreted envelope is expelled, the mechanism -- impulsive ejection, multiple outflows or prolonged winds, or a common-envelope interaction -- remains uncertain. GeV $γ$-ray detections from $>20$ Galactic novae establish these eruptions as nearby laboratories for shock physics and particle acceleration, underscoring the need to determine how novae eject their envelopes. Here we report on near-infrared interferometry, supported with multiwavelength observations, of two $γ$-ray detected novae. The images of the very fast 2021 nova V1674~Her, taken just 2--3 days after discovery, reveal the presence of two perpendicular outflows. The interaction between these outflows likely drives the observed $γ$-ray emission. Conversely, the images of the very slow 2021 nova V1405~Cas suggest a delay in the ejection of the bulk of the accreted envelope of more than 50 days after the start of eruption, as the nova slowly rises to visible peak and during which the envelope engulfed the system in a common envelope phase. These unprecedented images offer direct observational evidence that the mechanisms driving mass ejection from the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs are not as simple as previously thought, revealing multiple outflows and delayed ejections."}

We show that the pulse can be absorbed when $ω_{\\rm B}/a_0< ω< a_0ω_{\\rm B}$, where $a_0>1$ is the strength parameter of the pulse, and $ω$ and $ω_{\\rm B}$ respectively are the frequency of the wave and the cyclotron frequency in the background magnetic field (all quantities are defined in the reference frame where the particles are at rest before being illuminated by the pulse). The condition $ω_{\\rm B}/a_0< ω< a_0ω_{\\rm B}$ is essentially a generalization of the cyclotron resonance to strong electromagnetic pulses with $a_0>1$. When $ω_{\\rm B}/a_0< ω< a_0ω_{\\rm B}$, the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a plasma can be very different with respect to the propagation in vacuum because the wave equation is strongly non-linear.

We discuss implications of our results for constraining emission models of fast radio bursts."}

Under this limit, the field equations yield the constraint $F(Q,T)H(t)=C$, implying that the function $F=f_Q$ becomes purely dependent on the nonmetricity scalar $Q$, and the background evolution mimics that of the standard $Λ$CDM model. We derive the resulting functional forms of $f(Q)$, obtain the corresponding effective cosmological constant, and analyze the physical nature of this reduction. To test the model against observations, we constrain the parameters $H_0$, $Ω_m$, and $S_8$ using cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Pantheon+ SN Ia datasets. A comparative analysis is performed using both the conventional Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and a machine-learning based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) emulator. We find that the ANN approach yields tighter posterior constraints while significantly reducing computational time. The model successfully reproduces the observational trends of each dataset and offers insights into the persistent $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. Our results indicate that effective nonmetricity-based dark energy scenarios derived from $f(Q,T)$ gravity provide a viable and observationally consistent alternative to $Λ$CDM, with future high-precision surveys expected to further distinguish between these frameworks."}

This work leverages widespread efforts to understand the soft X-ray emission from the Galaxy, as well as the cosmic X-ray background and instrument-specific, particle-induced backgrounds. Statistically, a forward model of the foregrounds and backgrounds is preferable to alternatives because it requires no binning of the data, and allows straightforward marginalization over systematic uncertainties. We apply these methods to several galaxy clusters at intermediate-to-high redshifts, spanning a range of masses and morphologies, using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data. Our results suggest a modest improvement even for relatively bright clusters at these redshifts, and more substantial advantages in the high-redshift, low-surface-brightness regime. We also discuss and provide a simple correction for a time-dependent miscalibration of the Chandra ACIS detectors identified in archival galaxy cluster data."}

Such inference relies on building appropriate equation-of-state priors, such as the recently introduced semi-agnostic constructions that incorporate nuclear theory and experimental information available in low to intermediate density regimes, while offering the necessary flexibility at high density. In this paper, we assess how detections of mass, radius, and tidal deformability for low-mass ($\\sim 1$M$_{\\odot}$) or high-mass ($\\sim 1.9$M$_{\\odot}$) neutron stars would contribute to constraining nuclear empirical parameters in an inference based on semi-agnostic equation-of-state priors. We first assessed the correlation factors between nuclear empirical parameters and the zero-temperature and $β$-equilibrated pressure in different regimes of density. We then simulate observations for three nucleonic equations of state to test the recovery of the corresponding nuclear empirical parameters. We show that not all nuclear empirical parameters significantly correlate with the pressure and find a competition between them in the high-density regime that challenges their inference. We also find that using semi-agnostic constructions instead of assuming a nucleonic content up to the highest densities in the neutron-star core can help recover more accurately the true nuclear empirical parameters. Parameterizing the high-density regime of the equation of state with the nucleonic meta-model can pollute the inference of nuclear empirical parameters; semi-agnostic constructions are a solution to that. However, many nuclear matter empirical parameters contribute in a similar way to the building of baryonic pressure."}

First, we find that as the dark matter parameter $\\left|α\\right|$ increases, the fundamental characteristic quantities of the black hole, the event horizon $r_h$, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$, and the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$ all increase, while the peak of the effective potential $V_{\\text{eff}}$ decreases and shifts toward the direction of increasing $r$. In contrast, the magnetic charge parameter $g$ suppresses $r_h$, $r_{ph}$, and $b_{ph}$, while increases the peak of $V_{\\text{eff}}$ and shifts it toward the direction of decreasing $r$. This indicates a competing effect between the dark matter parameter $\\left|α\\right|$ and the magnetic charge parameter $g$ on the fundamental properties of the black hole. Furthermore, we use the EHT observational data to constrain the dark matter parameters $α$ and find that the constraint range given by the supermassive black hole SgrA* is stricter than that of the black hole M87*. Finally, the black hole images are studied based on different accretion models, and it is found that both dark matter parameters $α$ and accretion models significantly influence the black hole images. For larger dark matter parameters $\\left|α\\right|$, the inner shadow or central faint illuminating region of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by PFDM is larger but the bright ring of the image is fainter. This provides a potential method for us to distinguish between classical Bardeen black holes and Bardeen black holes surrounded by PFDM. These preliminary results may provide some clues for future investigations of dark matter using black hole shadows and images."}

We extend previous results to cover cases of particular phenomenological interest where the scalar background oscillates sinusoidally but not necessarily slowly compared to the thermalization rates of the primordial bath. Based on these results, we estimate the thermal damping of scalars coupled to neutrinos linearly, to gluons quadratically, and to WIMPs linearly, and demonstrate its importance in certain parameter space of these models. We also estimate the thermal damping rates in models of QCD axion."}

We present a critical re-analysis of GW190521 -- a short-duration, merger-dominated event with conflicting interpretations. Spin-aligned and precessing analyses at two ringdown start times show that precession induces modest but systematic shifts in inferred parameters and subdominant mode amplitudes, although such ringdown-only analyses provide no strong evidence for precession. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-informed precessing ringdown modelling, paving the way for the identification of spin precession in gravitational-wave events using solely their ringdown stages, where waveform systematics are expected to be substantially less prominent."}

From simulations to sky: Advancing machine-learning lens detection with real Euclid data", "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "In the era of large-scale surveys like Euclid, machine learning has become an essential tool for identifying rare yet scientifically valuable objects, such as strong gravitational lenses. However, supervised machine-learning approaches require large quantities of labelled examples to train on, and the limited number of known strong lenses has lead to a reliance on simulations for training. A well-known challenge is that machine-learning models trained on one data domain often underperform when applied to a different domain: in the context of lens finding, this means that strong performance on simulated lenses does not necessarily translate into equally good performance on real observations. In Euclid's Quick Data Release 1 (Q1), covering 63 deg2, 500 strong lens candidates were discovered through a synergy of machine learning, citizen science, and expert visual inspection. These discoveries now allow us to quantify this performance gap and investigate the impact of training on real data. We find that a network trained only on simulations recovers up to 92% of simulated lenses with 100% purity, but only achieves 50% completeness with 24% purity on real Euclid data. By augmenting training data with real Euclid lenses and non-lenses, completeness improves by 25-30% in terms of the expected yield of discoverable lenses in Euclid DR1 and the full Euclid Wide Survey. Roughly 20% of this improvement comes from the inclusion of real lenses in the training data, while 5-10% comes from exposure to a more diverse set of non-lenses and false-positives from Q1. We show that the most effective lens-finding strategy for real-world performance combines the diversity of simulations with the fidelity of real lenses. This hybrid approach establishes a clear methodology for maximising lens discoveries in future data releases from Euclid, and will likely also be applicable to other surveys such as LSST."}

To achieve good discrimination power of gamma rays against protons, an unconventional approach is presented that exploits the geomagnetic influence on air shower muons in Monte Carlo shower events. A recognizable polar asymmetry in the positive and negative muon distributions is noticed after transforming the impact coordinates of each muon from the observer plane onto the shower front plane, plus a judicious ignoring of the minimal attenuation of muons in the space between the two planes. A couple of observables, $d_{\\text{max}}$ and $N_{μ; \\text{IQS}}^{\\text{tr.}}$, can be extracted from the formation of two densely populated positive and negative muon zones in each shower. Both observables demonstrate excellent gamma/proton discrimination power, with efficiencies of $93.2\\%$ and $98.6\\%$. This analysis permitted the usage of muon detectors just covering a small area of $\\simeq{1.4}\\%$ of a square-km array for ultra-high-energy gamma-ray observations.

In this paper, we revisit some of these claims and investigate the viability of a class of non-spherical extremal black holes. In particular, we revisit the regularity of perturbed extremal Reissner--Nordström AdS black holes showing that, while some certain components of the scalar stress energy tensor diverge, the backreaction remains finite. We also study geodesic completeness, identifying a simple geometric constraint which, if satisfied, ensures that null geodesics cross the horizon smoothly. This analysis suggests the existence of a broad class of spacetimes with regular non-spherical horizons."}

The Wide Field Instrument (WFI) on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will deliver some of the highest precision measurements of weak lensing ever made. Since weak lensing is based on statistics of faint sources, it can be biased by even tiny instrument systematics, including correlated read noise. Previous works have shown the infrared detectors used in the Roman WFI show correlations in their noise fields at a level significant for weak lensing measurements, even after application of standard reference pixel corrections; of particular concern is 1/f noise, which appears as horizontal banding in the detector frame. In this paper, we present imDestripe: a new Python module utilizing the multiple roll angles in Roman's observing strategy and linear algebra techniques to remove correlated noise stripes from observed images. We test imDestripe in a hybrid simulation by combining real noise realizations (from darks taken during ground testing) with simulated images of the astronomical scene, and find that the power spectrum of the banding can be suppressed by factors of 10--30 on large scales. We briefly discuss plans for further development of imDestripe in the context of the WFI pipeline."}

In particular, we consider a measurement of the jet region charge while simultaneously keeping track of the energy flow throughout the event, as characterized by the global event shape. As a concrete example, we focus on the measurement of the 1-Jettiness jet charge ($Q$), the jet charge of the jet region ($J$) defined within the framework of the 1-Jettiness global event shape ($τ_1$) for the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) process, $e^- + p \\to e^- + J + X$, with unpolarized or longitudinally polarized protons. The 1-Jettiness distribution, binned according to jet charge, allows for enhanced quark flavor separation of the initial state unpolarized or polarized PDFs. On the other hand, the jet charge distribution binned by 1-Jettiness can serve as a probe of quark flavor dynamics in the final state hadronization process. We derive a factorization theorem for simultaneous measurements of $τ_1$ and $Q$ in the resummation region, $τ_1 \\ll P_{J_T}$, where $P_{J_T}$ denotes the transverse momentum of the jet region. The factorization theorem contains a new universal charged jet function, generalizing the standard jet function to include a jet charge measurement. Therefore these universal functions can be extracted from a global analysis of N-jettiness and thrust at $e^+e^-$ colliders. We provide simulation studies to demonstrate the sensitivity of the 1-Jettiness jet charge observable to quark flavor dynamics in nucleon structure and explore the possibility of probing the final state hadronization process. This observable is well-suited for applications in existing HERA data and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)."}

The spectral data up to $78$ keV in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) requires models with two Comptonizing regions. In contrast, models with a single Comptonizing region adequately describe the soft-intermediate states (SIMS), implying a significant evolution in the disk-corona geometry between the states. The hard X-ray tail above $100$ keV in the HIMS, detected with both AstroSat/CZTI and Insight-HXMT/HE, indicates that the electron population in the corona is not purely thermal but rather hybrid, with a power-law distribution above the thermal cutoff. While both the reflection modeling and disk continuum fitting favor a truncated disk geometry in the HIMS, the disk substantially moves close to the innermost stable circular orbit in the SIMS, accompanied by a significant rise in the disk temperature. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the QPO frequency from $\\sim1.3$ to $\\sim6.6$ Hz. From joint modeling of the disk continuum and reflection component, we estimate a black hole mass of $10.5^{+7.7}_{-3.0}$, spin of $0.79^{+0.03}_{-0.13}$, and disk inclination angle of $42^\\circ$-$50^\\circ$, which match well with the previously reported spectro-polarimetric measurements. The inferred source distance of $\\sim3.5$ kpc is consistent with the recent estimate based on optical spectroscopy.

In this paper, we intend to study the repetitive Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole. We will explore influences of the cosmological parameter on the repetitive Penrose process. The results show that, in addition to a similar third law of thermodynamics, the Kerr-dS black hole yields a higher energy return on investment (EROI) and single-extraction energy capability compared to the Kerr black hole. Specifically, the larger the cosmological parameter, the stronger the EROI and the single-extraction energy capability. Furthermore, we also find that at a lower decay radius, the Kerr black hole exhibits a higher energy utilization efficiency (EUE) and more extracted energy after the repetitive Penrose process is completed. However, at a higher decay radius, the situation is reversed, i.e., the Kerr-dS black hole exhibits a higher EUE and more extracted energy, which is due to the existence of stopping condition of the iteration."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($Δx < H_{\\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($Δx \\ll H_{\\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($Δx \\gg H_{\\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "The Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has exhibited prolific high-energy (HE) bursting activity in recent years. Investigating its potential tera-electronvolt counterpart could provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of magnetar emission and very high-energy (VHE) processes in extreme astrophysical environments. We aim to search for a possible tera-electronvolt counterpart to both its persistent and sub-second-scale burst emission. We analysed over 25 h of observations from the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) during periods of HE activity from SGR 1935+2154 in 2021 and 2022 to search for persistent emission. For bursting emission, we selected and analysed nine 0.1 s time windows centred around known short X-ray bursts, targeting potential sub-second-scale tera-electronvolt counterparts in a low-photon-statistics regime. While no persistent or bursting emission was detected in our search, we establish upper limits for the tera-electronvolt emission of a short magnetar burst simultaneous to its soft gamma-ray flux. Specifically, for the brightest burst in our sample, the ratio between tera-electronvolt and X-ray flux is less than $10^{-3}$. The non-detection of either persistent or bursting tera-electronvolt emission from SGR 1935+2154 suggests that if such components exist, they may occur under specific conditions not covered by our observations. This aligns with theoretical predictions of VHE components in magnetar-powered fast radio bursts and the detection of MeV - GeV emission in giant magnetar flares. These findings underscore the potential of magnetars, fast radio bursts, and other fast transients as promising candidates for future observations in the low-photon-statistics regime with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, particularly with the CTAO."}

In this work, we present a unified and fully analytic study of the TLNs of three representative classes of regular black holes -- the Bardeen black hole,the black hole with sub-Planckian curvature, and the black hole arising in asymptotically safe gravity -- under scalar, vector, and axial gravitational perturbations. Employing a Green's function method combined with systematic perturbative expansions, we show that TLNs of regular black holes are generically nonzero and exhibit strong model and mode dependence. In many cases, higher-order corrections develop logarithmic scale dependence, closely resembling renormalization-group running in quantum field theory and revealing a scale-dependent tidal response absent in classical black holes. Our analysis demonstrates that the internal structure of regular black holes, including de Sitter or Minkowski cores and quantum-gravity-inspired modifications, leaves distinct fingerprints in their tidal properties. These results establish TLNs as promising probes for testing regular black hole models with future gravitational-wave observations."}

We present a critical re-analysis of GW190521 -- a short-duration, merger-dominated event with conflicting interpretations. Spin-aligned and precessing analyses at two ringdown start times show that precession induces modest but systematic shifts in inferred parameters and subdominant mode amplitudes, although such ringdown-only analyses provide no strong evidence for precession. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-informed precessing ringdown modelling, paving the way for the identification of spin precession in gravitational-wave events using solely their ringdown stages, where waveform systematics are expected to be substantially less prominent."}

Global fits of anomalous oscillation data which search for one or more eV-scale sterile neutrinos are particularly challenging both to evaluate and to reconcile in the global picture. Fits (especially joint ones) to oscillation data suffer from significant computational burdens, such as likelihood intractability, making traditional Markov Chain-Monte Carlo all but impossible. Given evidence both supporting and challenging beyond Standard Model physics across neutrino experiments of various baselines, energies, and detection techniques, the global search for sterile neutrinos requires additional tools in order to determine whether sterile neutrinos remain a viable solution to unexplained anomalies. Furthermore, both a Bayesian and frequentist interpretation of sterile neutrino data is needed for a complete assessment of longstanding tensions in the field. Techniques from the machine learning subfield of simulation-based inference have a natural application to such a problem. In this contribution, we illustrate some of the outstanding questions of the global picture of light sterile neutrinos by focusing on experiments searching with the disappearance of electron (anti)neutrinos, and look to posterior density estimation strategies to craft answers, including comparisons to a machine-learning-based frequentist approach."}

Such forces inevitably arise between ordinary matter particles whenever they couple to light mediator species. Conventional computations of quantum forces rely on evaluating one-loop Feynman diagrams of the relevant scattering processes. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to compute quantum forces. Instead of relying on perturbative scattering amplitudes, we directly evaluate the quantum fluctuations of the mediator field by solving its quantized equation of motion with appropriate boundary conditions. This approach remains valid beyond the Born approximation and thus applies to regimes of strong coupling between the mediator and matter fields. In the weak-coupling limit, our results reproduce the known expressions from the Feynman diagram approach. In the strong-coupling regime, the result is modified by a factor that can suppress or enhance the effect. In contrast to classical forces, quantum forces intrinsically violate the superposition principle. Our approach may therefore offer a useful tool for probing non-perturbative effects in the infrared regime."}

Since differential rotation is the primary mechanism delaying the collapse of these remnants, understanding its behavior is crucial when assessing the impact of an embedded dark component. In this work, we extend the numerical code RNS to describe two gravitationally coupled fluids in differential rotation, with baryonic matter modeled by a realistic nuclear equation of state and dark matter represented as a self-interacting bosonic condensate. Within this framework, we construct equilibrium sequences for a representative differential rotation law, providing a basis to explore how dark matter may influence the global properties and rotational dynamics of binary neutron star remnants."}
