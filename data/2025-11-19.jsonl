Small telescopes offer several advantages: they are cost-effective, occupy less space, and are simpler to set up than larger instruments. This makes them particularly suitable for amateur astronomers and educational institutions with limited resources. Moreover, small telescopes can effectively observe bright celestial objects, enabling valuable contributions to astronomical projects. Based on the Sol'EX design, SPECTRUMMATE was constructed using optical components available at the Space and Applications Laboratory (SpaceLAB), University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam. The instrument is designed to meet the specific needs of astronomers who require detailed analysis within the visible spectrum (SPECTRUMMATE can capture a waveband of 368 angstrom/image, spectral coverage from 4000 to 6600 angstrom, and resolving power R = 2546 at 5500 angstrom). To achieve optimal performance, the design process involved selecting and configuring optical elements, including a collimator, diffraction grating, and objective lens. Experimental setups were tested to minimize spectral dispersion while ensuring the system's compactness and ease of alignment. Spectra obtained by SPECTRUMMATE demonstrated efficient spectral calibration and the capability to capture high-resolution spectra of bright light sources, such as the Sun, making it a valuable tool for specialised spectroscopic observations. The modular design of SPECTRUMMATE also allows users to change its components easily to achieve the desired spectral range and resolution."}

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and high-redshift detectability, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their $ T_{90} $ duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the $ T_{90} $ classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a kilonova-associated GRB (KN/GRBs) sample, we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts ($ z < 1 $). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR."}

A differential piston, arising from either the adaptive optics (AO) control loop, thermomechanical effects, or other sources, significantly degrades the image quality and is detrimental to the telescope's overall performance. In a numerical simulation set-up, we propose a method for estimating the differential piston between the petals of the ELT's M4 mirror using images from a 2x2 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS), commonly used in the ELT's tomographic AO mode. We aim to identify the limitations of this approach by evaluating its sensitivity to various observing conditions and sources of noise. Using a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture, we trained a neural network (NN) on simulated datasets to estimate the differential piston. We assessed the robustness of the method under various conditions, including variations in Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, and detector noise. The performance was quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated differential piston aberration. This method demonstrates the ability to extract differential piston information from 2x2 SH-WFS images. Temporal averaging of frames makes the differential piston signal emerge from the turbulence-induced speckle field and leads to a significant improvement in the RMSE calculation. As expected, better seeing conditions result in improved accuracy. Polychromaticity only degrades the performance by less than 5% compared to the monochromatic case. In a realistic scenario, detector noise is not a limiting factor, as the primary limitation rather arises from the need for sufficient speckle averaging. The network was also shown to be applicable to input images other than the 2x2 SH-WFS data."}

In the Newman-Penrose formulation, the twist $\\text{Im}(ρ)$ is sourced by a twist potential sitting in the transverse null dyad $(m,\\bar{m})$, while in the metric formulation this potential arises from $g_{ra}\\neq0$. We explain how to arrange and solve the Einstein equations for such generalized line elements, thereby providing an extension of the Bondi hierarchy to asymptotically-flat spacetimes with non-vanishing twist. We work out the twisting generalizations of all the well-known features pertaining to asymptotically-flat spacetimes in Bondi gauge, such as the solution space, the flux-balance laws, the asymptotic symmetries, and the transformation laws. The twist potential has a natural Carrollian interpretation as an Ehresmann connection, and gives rise to Carroll boosts as extra asymptotic symmetries. One of the advantages of the Bondi gauge with non-vanishing twist is that it allows to write algebraically special solutions in a manifestly finite radial expansion, and with a repeated principal null direction such that $Ψ_0=Ψ_1=0$. This is in particular the case for the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution. The asymptotic symmetries of algebraically special solutions also have a finite radial expansion, which enables to study the supertranslated Schwarzschild solution and its charges quite straightforwardly. We expect that these results will find applications in the development of flat holography for algebraically special solutions and in the study of their perturbations. We also study an analogue of the twist in three-dimensional spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant, and find an 8-dimensional solution space which encompasses and generalizes the existing results in the literature."}

Galaxy mergers are proposed as very high-energy CR accelerators, which are expected to produce high-energy (HE) $γ$ rays and neutrinos through interactions with the ambient gas and low-energy background radiation fields. For the first time, we systematically study the HE $γ$-ray emission from galaxy mergers utilising 16.7 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) data with the sample list compiled from eight survey catalogs. Our analysis finds 8 galaxy mergers that exhibit $γ$-ray emission with significance $\\gtrsim5σ$ in the 1-500 GeV energy range.

We compare the stacked spectral energy distributions of the galaxy mergers with the projected sensitivity of the upcoming $γ$-ray telescope Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Furthermore, we find that 18 previously unassociated Fermi-LAT sources are spatially coincident with galaxy mergers. Our findings establish galaxy mergers as a new class of HE $γ$-ray sources. Future neutrino and $γ$-ray observatories will be crucial to discover the particle acceleration mechanism in these newly identified CR sources."}

These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $-\\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge."}

It is usually thought that the BHs are of second (or higher) generation (2G), resulting from the mergers of smaller BHs. But the physical processes that produce the merging 2G BH binaries are unclear and highly unconstrained. We show that such 2G mergers can be naturally produced in the nuclear star cluster of Milky Way-like galaxy. The dominant channel combines a sequence of binary-single interactions with secular evolution driven by the central supermassive BH. Our model produces a merger rate consistent with GW231123 and further predicts an abundant population of 2G BH-star (or low-mass BH) binaries; these binaries may observationally manifest as micro tidal disruption events or low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) sources.

However, a significant theoretical gap exists in the poorly explored spectrum of isoscalar pseudotensor mesons, where several predicted radial excitations remain unobserved. To address this, we investigate the production of four such states ($η_2(4D)$, $η'_2(2D)$, $η'_2(3D)$, and $η'_2(4D)$) employing an effective Lagrangian approach combined with Regge trajectory phenomenology to describe the high-energy behavior of the reactions. Our calculations reveal a distinct production selectivity: the $η_2(4D)$ state is more prominent in pion induced ($π^- p \\to η_2 n$) reactions, whereas the $η'_2(2D, 3D, 4D)$ states are preferentially produced in kaon induced ($K^- p \\to η_2 Λ$) processes. Moreover, the total cross sections for these states exhibit characteristic peaks at specific beam momenta, providing clear kinematic windows for their discovery. This study provides the first comprehensive theoretical predictions for the production cross sections of these predicted mesons, offering crucial guidance for future experimental searches."}

Our analysis shows that the traditional equipartition estimate works well at the kpc scale of the simulation box, but breaks down at smaller scales. We find that the predicted magnetic field strength can be improved at small scales by assuming a constant CR energy density across each mock radio observation. The large-scale mean CR energy density can be estimated by assuming equipartition with the large-scale mean magnetic energy density, or as a function of additional observable quantities such as the star formation rate surface density or gas weight.

Both the rotating and non-rotating horizons are then embedded in the Plebański-Demiański spacetimes, which naturally admit horizons of this type. Furthermore, we compare our results with previously obtained solutions to the Einstein vacuum extremal horizon equation with cosmological constant and the solution of Petrov type D equation with transversal bundle structure."}

However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars -- to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 over 4.5 years and two decades in frequency (300 MHz to 6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in December 2018. We present detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810$-$197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810$-$197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant-pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of the detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases."}

A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms.

In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors."}

Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a \"scoured\" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $γ_{\\rm sp} \\gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $γ_{\\rm sp} \\lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\\sim 10^{4}\\,M_\\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude.

Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter."}

The simulated inclusive $J/ψ$ transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) differential cross sections agree well with the experimental data at both the middle and forward rapidities. For the $J/ψ$ yield, the dominant contribution comes from the NRQCD channel, while the cluster collapse and non-prompt processes provide relatively minor contributions. A decomposition of the NRQCD component, comprising direct production from the parton hard scattering and feed-down from $ψ(2S)$, $χ_{c0}$, $χ_{c1}$, and $χ_{c2}$, reveals that at low (high) $p_{\\rm T}$ the dominant contributions come from the direct production and $χ_{c2}$ ($χ_{c1}$) feed-down.

In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave\" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three."}

Mass spectra show similar structure when introducing the contribution of Polyakov potential and IMC effect. The mass of $K_0$ meson $m_{K_0}$ is controlled by chiral symmetry breaking and restoration. It increases with temperature in the low temperature region, and shows a mass jump at the Mott transition. Further increasing temperature, $m_{K_0}$ firstly decreases and then increases with temperature. $π_0$ meson is not only the pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, but also influenced by the flavor mixing of $π_0-η-η'$. The behavior of $m_{π_0}$ is different from $m_{K_0}$ only at high temperature region, which decreases with temperature. For $η$ and $η'$ mesons, they are affected by both the $U_A(1)$ anomaly and the flavor mixing of $π_0-η-η'$. The mass of $η$ meson $m_η$ decreases with temperature in low temperature region and then shows a jump at its Mott transition.

Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter.

For many events, the radio synchrotron emission is inferred to originate from the interaction of mildly-relativistic outflows, launched with delay times of $\\sim 100$--$1000$ d after the TDE optical peak. The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows (\"flares\") from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_ν \\sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events.

We simulate the evolution of supernova remnants resulting from such detonations in a variety of binary progenitors and compare them against a double detonation with a surviving donor. Because of the time delay between the detonations of the two white dwarfs, high-velocity ejecta from the first explosion governs the first few centuries of remnant evolution, whereas at later times the dense core resulting from the donor detonation drives both the forward and reverse shocks to larger radii. The collision between the highest-velocity ejecta of the primary explosion and the donor carves a conical wake into the ejecta, which persists into the remnant phase regardless of whether or not the donor detonates. Our suite of simulated remnants are found to exhibit multiple distinguishing features of the explosion properties: a distinct X-ray morphology in the thermal emission and iron lines for triple detonations and smaller remnants with centrally-concentrated emission for double detonations.

By considering the dominant $ρK$ and $K^*π$ coupled channels, we reproduce the well-established double-pole structure and trace the chiral evolution of both poles as functions of the pion mass, using the vector-meson mass trajectories fitted to lattice-QCD data and experimental values. The lower pole, dominantly coupled to $K^*π$, evolves from an above-threshold resonance to a virtual or bound state with increasing pion mass. In comparison, the higher pole, dominantly coupled to $ρK$, moves downward in energy, reflecting the strengthening of the chiral attraction. The influence of the finite vector-meson widths is systematically examined, showing that their inclusion smooths the pole trajectories without altering their qualitative behavior. Furthermore, femtoscopic CFs are calculated for all relevant vector-pseudoscalar channels in both charged sectors. The results exhibit distinct resonance and bound-state features consistent with the two-pole dynamics. The weak impact of higher channels, such as $ω\\bar{K}$, $\\bar{K}^*η$, and $φ\\bar{K}$, confirms that the simplified two-channel treatment captures the essential dynamics of the $K_1(1270)$ resonance.

Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy. We also compute representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits and demonstrate that gamma != 1 can induce phase shifts and amplitude modulations correlated with changes in the zoom-whirl structure. In particular, larger zoom numbers lead to increasingly complex substructures in the waveforms, and finite deviations from gamma=1 can significantly modify these features.

By comparing the observational results with pre-supernova models, we suggest that the progenitor of J0550-6823 likely had an extended convective shell that reduces the Ne/Mg ratio prior to its explosion. Furthermore, we observe that $\\sim$2--3 Mg-rich SNRs exist in the LMC, suggesting that $\\lesssim$10--40\\% of massive stars in the LMC may have had an extended convective shell, similar to what we observed in J0550-6823. This fraction would be important for understanding the final stages of the evolution of massive stars and galactic chemical evolution."}

We performed X-ray monitoring of the source with NICER and AstroSat near the peak of the event. Our primary objective is to investigate the energy and luminosity dependence of the pulsed emission, characterize the spin evolution, and study the broadband X-ray spectral properties of RX J0520.5-6932 during the outburst. The AstroSat/LAXPC and NICER light curves reveal pronounced short-duration flaring activity lasting ~400-700 s, with enhancements by a factor of ~2. The pulse profile exhibits a strong dependence on both energy and intensity, evolving from a simple single-peaked structure at low energies to complex multi-peaked shapes at intermediate energies, and reverting to simpler morphologies at higher energies. Pulse profiles during the flares differ significantly from those in the persistent state, indicating changes in the pulsed beam pattern with a change in the intensity on a short timescale. Broadband spectral analysis reveals a soft excess and an emission feature at ~1 keV, likely arising from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc and fluorescence from Ne K and Fe L ions. Continuous NICER monitoring over nearly one orbital cycle enabled us to track spin evolution with accretion-driven spin-up and spectral variability in the soft X-ray band. Additionally, a declining spin-up rate is observed during the outburst, likely due to a gradual reduction in mass accretion rate. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the complex accretion dynamics in RX J0520.5-6932 during its 2024 outburst. The strong variability in pulse shape and spin behaviour highlights rapid changes in the accretion geometry and torque as a function of accretion rate. [Abridged]"}

Our aim is to reproduce in the laboratory the extreme photoionization conditions found in accretion-powered astrophysical sources. In this paper, we compare the experimental results on K-$β$ X-ray Ar spectra with modelling using the time-dependent version of the Cloudy astrophysical code. The results indicate that photoionized laboratory plasmas can be successfully modelled with codes such as Cloudy that have been developed for application to astrophysical sources. Our comparison of simulation and experiment shows that the flux of sub-keV photons that photoionize the outer-shell electrons can have a significant effect, and that detailed measurements of the X-ray drive spectrum across all photon energy ranges are crucial for accurate modelling of experiments."}

The generated magnetic field can reach values up to $10^{16}$ G, depending on $μ$, and the electric field will be 3 orders smaller. The fact that the DCDW phase is able to induce a magnetic field can be seen as its spontaneous tendency to remove the so called Landau-Peierls instability that is present in this single-modulated phase in the absence of a magnetic field. The spontaneous induction of a strong magnetic field at intermediate to high densities can be of interest for the astrophysics of compact stellar objects exhibiting strong magnetic fields as magnetars."}

The pairs of morphological features are two opposite rings, a strip of dense ejecta extending on both sides of the central pulsar PSR J1811-1925, and an ear-nozzle opposite structure. According to the JJEM, additional weaker pairs of jets may also have participated in the explosion. The jets' axis from the ear to the nozzle coincides with the axis of the presently active pulsar jets, which is the pulsar spin axis. The jets of this pair were the last that the newly born neutron star launched during the explosion, and the accretion disk that launched these jets spun up the neutron star in the same direction as the jets.

The strategy involves matching the solution for the linearised fluid dynamics in the star's interior to the spacetime perturbations in the near-zone surrounding the body, along with an identification of the tidal driving and the star's response. Notably, this identification is exact in Newtonian gravity and we provide strong evidence that it remains robust also in the relativistic case. The argument does not involve a sum over the star's quasinormal modes and hence circumvents one of the obstacles that have held up the development of models for relativistic tides. Numerical results are provided, at the proof-of-principle level, for a realistic matter equation of state from the BSk family, including composition stratification leading to the presence of low-frequency gravity modes. We also sketch the connection with the field-theory inspired approach to the problem, in which the tidal response is expressed in terms of asymptotic scattering amplitudes."}

We perform the first numerical study of the complete dynamics of the lighter-than-QCD axion in a neutron star in 1+1 general relativity, extending the region of analysis to low-mass axions with kilometer-scale Compton wavelengths. We calculate gravitational effects of the axion field on the neutron star and show that for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants, neutron star properties, such as the mass, radius, and compactness, are affected at the order-1 level. This result indicates that approximate universal tidal deformability-compactness relation for neutron stars is non-trivially broken and can serve as a probe of lighter-than-QCD axions, independent of the unknown nuclear equation of state.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and high-redshift detectability, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their $ T_{90} $ duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the $ T_{90} $ classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a kilonova-associated GRB (KN/GRBs) sample, we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts ($ z < 1 $). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR."}

A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors."}

The method is based on transformations from the comoving frame, where the fluid flow is simplest and the decomposition has been known for a long time. The key innovation we introduce is that of quasi-invertible transformations. In this first paper, we introduce these transformations using the simpler example of relativistic hydrodynamics. We recover the known decomposition for relativistic hydrodynamics in somewhat simpler form than previously derived, and without the need for computer algebra. A new result in this paper is the characteristic decomposition when the the evolution tracks the composition of a fluid in nuclear statistical equilibrium. In Paper II of this series, we apply a quasi-invertible transformation to derive the complete characteristic decomposition for GRMHD in the conserved variables used in simulations."}

Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a \"scoured\" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $γ_{\\rm sp} \\gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $γ_{\\rm sp} \\lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\\sim 10^{4}\\,M_\\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\\lesssim 10\\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter."}

Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair."}

Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers."}

In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $μ(φ) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $μ(φ)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically.
