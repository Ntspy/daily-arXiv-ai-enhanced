Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck,\" requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes.

Corresponding Bjorken energy density estimates for Pb-Pb collisions are also presented for comparison. Taking the Bjorken energy density and formation time as initial conditions, the subsequent longitudinal evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these collisions is studied. Both ideal and first-order viscous boost-invariant hydrodynamics are employed to assess the influence of dissipation. We observe that viscous effects slow the longitudinal expansion and lead to entropy production dominated by early-time dynamics. The lifetime of the QGP is observed to increase with centrality and is substantially enhanced by viscous effects. These effects are highly sensitive to the choice of formation time, particularly in peripheral collisions. A comparative analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions demonstrates that the longitudinal evolution is primarily controlled by the initial energy density scale set by the Bjorken prescription.

Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories.

By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \\gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution.
