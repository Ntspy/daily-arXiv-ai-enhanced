Abstract: Astrometry, one of the oldest branches of astronomy, has been revolutionized
by missions like Hipparcos and especially Gaia, which mapped billions of stars
with extraordinary precision. However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like
exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter
in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6--8 meter
large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable
Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect
rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider
here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated
astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited
images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20
milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform
high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass
planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically
improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy
dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter
particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The
visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with
stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The ``Detector
Calibration Unit'' system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel
positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable
telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to
sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter
through stellar motion.

### [2] [Modeling atmospheric phase corruptions in high-frequency VLBI using Gaussian processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19071)
*Uri Rolls,Dominic W. Pesce,Paul Tiede,Lindy Blackburn,Iniyan Natarajan,Sheperd S. Doeleman*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents a Gaussian Process (GP) model for calibrating phase corruptions in EHT VLBI observations, eliminating the need for a reference station and improving calibration through Kalman filtering, validated on 3C 279 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address rapid atmospheric phase fluctuations at submillimeter wavelengths that degrade calibration and sensitivity in EHT observations.

Method: The method involves jointly modeling phase errors with source structure using GPs, applying Kalman filtering for efficient marginalization, and establishing a global phase zero point without a reference station.

Result: The approach produces calibration solutions consistent with EHT Collaboration results and can be extended for frequency-dependent phase calibration.

Conclusion: The GP-based calibration framework enhances VLBI sensitivity by effectively handling atmospheric phase variations and offers a scalable solution for future upgrades.

Abstract: Using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations at
(sub)millimeter wavelengths, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) currently
achieves the finest angular resolution of any astronomical facility, necessary
for imaging the horizon-scale structure around supermassive black holes. A
significant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid
variations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the
array, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated
signal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable
sensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based
phase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We
adopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these
phase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly
erratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman
filtering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions,
which permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space. Our model
also removes the need to specify an arbitrary ``reference station'' during
calibration, instead establishing a global phase zeropoint by enforcing the GPs
at all stations to have fixed mean and finite variance. We validate our method
using a real EHT observation of the blazar 3C 279, demonstrating that our
approach yields calibration solutions that are consistent with those determined
by the EHT Collaboration. The model presented here can be straightforwardly
extended to incorporate frequency-dependent phase behavior, such as is relevant
for the frequency phase transfer calibration technique.

### [3] [Segmentation and Celestial Mapping of Unobservable Regions in Nighttime All-sky Images for the Mephisto Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19335)
*Jian Cui,Guo-Wang Du,Xin-Zhong Er,Chu-Xiang Li,Jun-Fan Hou,Yu-Xin Xin,Xiang-kun Liu,Xiao-Wei Liu*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning framework for real-time detection of unobservable regions in nighttime all-sky images, addressing limitations of traditional methods by providing precise pixel-level masks that integrate with telescope scheduling systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like infrared sensing and photometric extinction give coarse, non-spatial estimates leading to wasted observation time and data contamination from clouds or moonlight. The need for precise, spatially-aware detection drove the development of this framework.

Method: A deep learning segmentation model processes all-sky images to produce pixel-level masks of cloud-covered and moonlight-affected regions. The masks are converted to celestial coordinates via Zenithal Equal-Area projection for integration with observation control systems (OCS).

Result: The framework successfully provides precise real-time detection compatible with telescope scheduling systems, demonstrated on the Mephisto telescope, and is adaptable to other robotic observatories with all-sky monitoring.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves observational efficiency and data quality by enabling cloud-aware scheduling. Its generalizability across observatories offers a scalable solution for nighttime sky clarity assessment.

Abstract: Accurate identification of unobservable regions in nighttime is essential for
autonomous scheduling and data quality control in observations.Traditional
methods-such as infrared sensing or photometric extinction-provide only
coarse,non-spatial estimates of sky clarity,making them insufficient for
real-time decision-making.This not only wastes observing time but also
introduces contamination when telescopes are directed toward cloud-covered or
moonlight-affected regions.To address these limitations,we propose a deep
learning-based segmentation framework that provides pixel-level masks of
unobservable areas using all-sky images.Supported by a manually annotated
dataset of nighttime images,our method enables precise detection of cloud- and
moonlight-affected regions.The segmentation results are further mapped to
celestial coordinates through Zenithal Equal-Area projection,allowing seamless
integration with observation control systems (OCS) for real-time cloud-aware
scheduling.While developed for the Mephisto telescope,the framework is
generalizable and applicable to other wide-field robotic observatories equipped
with all-sky monitoring.

### [4] [Advances in detector response and background modelling in the ANAIS-112 experiment for annual modulation and other rare event searches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19469)
*Tamara Pardo Yanguas*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The thesis details ANAIS-112's efforts to verify DAMA/LIBRA's dark matter claims using NaI(Tl) detectors, addressing systematic uncertainties via neutron calibrations and Geant4 simulations, refining background models, and exploring new physics like annual modulation and solar axions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To independently confirm DAMA/LIBRA's dark matter signal using the same NaI(Tl) detectors and mitigate systematic errors in quenching factors (QFs) and background modelling.

Method: The work involves neutron calibration tests with 252Cf sources, Geant4 simulations to model nuclear recoils and QFs, multiparametric background fitting, reanalysis of annual modulation data, and solar axion searches. Cross-checks between data and simulations identified Geant4's limitations in certain nuclear processes.

Result: Simulation-simulation discrepancies highlighted Geant4 deficiencies. QF models increasing with energy were favored over DAMA's. Background models improved, enabling sensitivity enhancement. New searches included reanalyzed modulation signals and solar axion constraints using six years of data.

Conclusion: ANAIS-112's improved methods advance dark matter detection, emphasizing the need for accurate QFs and refined simulations. Collaboration with COSINUS further strengthens understanding of internal backgrounds, maintaining DAMA's signal's relevance while addressing experimental challenges.

Abstract: Numerous astronomical and cosmological observations point to the existence of
dark matter, which constitutes about 27% of the Universe. Despite extensive
efforts, only the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using NaI(Tl) detectors at Gran Sasso
National Laboratory, has reported a positive dark matter signal. To
independently verify this result, using the same NaI target is essential. This
is the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators
since 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents
work within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of
Geant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity.
Efforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals' response to
nuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation
quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be
addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments.
For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed
since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data
with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies
in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations
have proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF
increases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis
has contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a
multiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have
been conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual
modulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure.
Finally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused
on background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the
experiment's sensitivity.

### [5] [Singular Value-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization (SAFR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19542)
*Lukas Weissinger,Simon Hubmer,Bernadett Stadler,Ronny Ramlau*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper presents a numerical implementation of the SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) for Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. The algorithm utilizes FFT and pre-computation to achieve faster processing and lower memory usage compared to traditional MVM methods. Evaluations using the COMPASS simulation environment, mimicking MORFEO on the ELT, show its effectiveness in reconstruction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve atmospheric tomography for adaptive optics systems like MORFEO on the ELT, addressing the need for faster and more memory-efficient algorithms than existing methods. The focus is on practical numerical implementation and performance evaluation of SAFR.

Method: The SAFR algorithm employs singular-value decomposition (SVD) combined with Fourier domain regularization. It leverages FFT for computational speed and pre-computes critical components to reduce memory usage. The method is implemented and tested within the COMPASS simulation framework using an MCAO setup similar to MORFEO.

Result: SAFR demonstrates superior computational efficiency and lower memory requirements compared to conventional MVM approaches. Numerical experiments confirm its effectiveness in reconstruction quality when applied to MCAO systems like those in the ELT's MORFEO instrument.

Conclusion: The SAFR algorithm provides a viable and efficient solution for atmospheric tomography in MCAO systems. Its speed and low memory usage make it particularly suitable for large-scale telescopes such as the ELT, enhancing adaptive optics performance without excessive resource demands.

Abstract: Atmospheric tomography, the problem of reconstructing atmospheric turbulence
profiles from wavefront sensor measurements, is an integral part of many
adaptive optics systems. It is used to enhance the image quality of
ground-based telescopes, such as for the Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Relay
For ELT Observations (MORFEO) instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope
(ELT). To solve this problem, a singular-value decomposition (SVD) based
approach has been proposed before. In this paper, we focus on the numerical
implementation of the SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain
Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) and its performance for Multi-Conjugate
Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. The key features of the SAFR algorithm are the
utilization of the FFT and the pre-computation of computationally demanding
parts. Together, this yields a fast algorithm with less memory requirements
than commonly used Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM) approaches. We evaluate
the performance of SAFR regarding reconstruction quality and computational
expense in numerical experiments using the simulation environment COMPASS, in
which we use an MCAO setup resembling the physical parameters of the MORFEO
instrument of the ELT.

### [6] [A resistive MHD module in the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18968)
*Sara Azizi,Swapnil Shankar,Philipp Mösta,Roland Haas,Erik Schnetter*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a GPU-accelerated resistive GRMHD code (GRaM-X) that incorporates resistivity into general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, enabling the study of magnetic reconnection and other dissipative processes in high-energy astrophysical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of ideal GRMHD by incorporating resistive effects necessary for modeling processes like magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric dynamics in astrophysical plasmas, which are not perfectly conducting.

Method: The code evolves resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for Einstein's equations. It uses a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for stiff source terms, one-dimensional recovery method for primitive variables, and combines the HLLE Riemann solver with TVD/WENO reconstruction.

Result: Validated through 1D shocktubes, current sheets, Alfvén waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars, showing accurate ideal MHD recovery, correct resistivity behavior, and stability in dynamical spacetimes.

Conclusion: The resistive GRaM-X enables efficient large-scale simulations, advancing studies of binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within multi-messenger astrophysics frameworks.

Abstract: Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical
settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD
approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent
description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential
for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric
dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts
for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We
present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which
evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for
Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta
scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the
conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the
HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We
validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes,
current sheets, Alfv\'{e}n waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars.
The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD
limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical
spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables
efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of
binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of
multi-messenger astrophysics.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzed TeV gamma-ray data from NGC 1275's 2017 flare to investigate ALP effects through photon-ALP mixing in the Perseus cluster's magnetic field. No ALP evidence was found, but exclusion limits were set in the mass-coupling parameter space using the CLs method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore ALP phenomenology by testing photon-ALP mixing predictions in a strong magnetic field environment, leveraging NGC 1275's location in the Perseus cluster which provides a large-scale magnetic field.

Method: VERITAS gamma-ray data analyzed with gammapy; likelihood analysis with CLs method applied to search for ALP signatures and set exclusion constraints on mass-coupling parameters.

Result: No ALP detection; strongest exclusions apply to 2e-7 eV to 4e-7 eV mass range and couplings ≥3e-11 GeV⁻¹, up to 80% confidence. Results align with prior studies.

Conclusion: CLs method proven reliable for setting limits in low-sensitivity scenarios; underscores need for future high-sensitivity observations to probe ALPs further.

Abstract: Background: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that
emerge in numerous theoretical extensions to the Standard Model. Their coupling
to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the
presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the
mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in
which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV
gamma-ray sources.
  Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a
dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the
Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended
magnetic field of strength O(10$\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse,
making it an excellent target to study ALPs.
  Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the
gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to
ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a
preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be
set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to
setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity.
  Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination
of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level.
We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and
coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range
$2 \times 10^{-7}$eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$eV and at the
coupling strength of $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to
80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies.
  Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and
advocate for its...

### [8] [X-ray Observations of Nova Scorpii 2023 (V1716 Sco) in Outburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19102)
*John Worley,Marina Orio,Andrej Dobrotka,Jozef Magdolen,Kim Page,Ehud Behar,Jeremy Drake,Sharon Mitrani*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of Nova Scorpii 2023 reveals it as a luminous supersoft X-ray source (SSS) with a 77.9-second periodic modulation linked to a massive 1.2 solar mass white dwarf (WD) rotation. Observations show irregular variability and a prolonged SSS phase, indicating a massive WD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the properties of Nova Scorpii 2023, including its X-ray emission behavior, white dwarf characteristics, and the cause of observed periodic modulations.

Method: Multi-instrument observations using Swift XRT, NICER, Chandra HRC/LETG. Analyzed SSS flux variability, spectral data for WD mass estimation, and timing studies to identify periodic modulations.

Result: Identified a stable 77.9s periodic modulation attributed to WD rotation; SSS phase lasted 9 months with fluctuating flux; derived WD mass ~1.2 solar masses via spectral analysis.

Conclusion: The periodic signal originates from the WD's spin, confirming its role in SSS variability. The massive WD supports nova models predicting extended SSS phases for higher masses.

Abstract: Nova Scorpii 2023 was first detected as a luminous supersoft X-ray source
(SSS) 93 days after outburst and continued emitting soft X-rays for over two
months, until it was too close to the Sun to observe. The nova was monitored
with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition
Explorer (NICER) on the International Space Station, and in long exposures with
the Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC) and Low Energy Transmission Grating
(LETG) on days 128, 129, and 183-185 after optical maximum. Swift detected a
rapidly decaying SSS when observations resumed, constraining the constant
bolometric luminosity phase to 9 months. The SSS flux was irregularly variable.
A nearly three-fold increase in flux was observed between August and October
2023 in the 15 to 35 Angstrom range, from 3.5 x 10^(-11) to 9.4 x 10^(-11) erg
cm^(-2) s^(-1). The SSS duration and effective temperature derived from the
October LETG spectra indicate a massive white dwarf with temperature fitting
nova evolutionary tracks for a 1.2 solar mass WD; emission lines superimposed
on the WD continuum are attributed to surrounding shocked ejecta. We present a
timing study based on Chandra and archival NICER data. The irregular
variability timescale was days, but a 77.9 second periodic modulation in the
SSS flux with varying amplitude was measured in many observations. Our analysis
shows that this period was stable; short drifts derived with NICER, but not in
long, uninterrupted Chandra exposures, are artifacts of measuring variable
amplitude modulation. We suggest the modulations are associated with the WD
rotation.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration
GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical
facilities COLIBR\'I, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large
Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio
observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs
with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination
of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy
with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and
optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger
time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the
slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at
$T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the
same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet
with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock
powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The
burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the
Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling
of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$),
which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the
classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the
prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and
underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the
importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.

### [10] [Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19143)
*J. I. Katz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The nature of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) remains elusive despite 18 years of study. Their extreme brightness suggests coherent emission, but the underlying plasma physics is unknown. FRBs are found in diverse environments, with some repeating and others seemingly one-off. Proposed sources include magnetars and black hole accretion discs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the enigmatic astronomical sources and radiation mechanisms behind FRBs, which are characterized by extreme brightness and diverse observational properties.

Method: The paper reviews existing observational data on FRBs, including their brightness temperatures (~10^36 K), detected locations (e.g., globular clusters, distant galaxies), repetition rates, and environmental variations (dense plasma vs. vacuum-like conditions). Hypotheses like magnetars and black hole systems are discussed.

Result: FRBs exhibit a wide range of behaviors: some repeat frequently, others don't; some are in dense environments, others in near-vacuum. Their high brightness implies coherent emission, but the mechanism remains unclear. No definitive source has been confirmed among proposed hypotheses.

Conclusion: FRBs challenge current astrophysical understanding due to their unique characteristics. Further observations and理论 development are needed to resolve their origin, emission mechanism, and environmental dependencies.

Abstract: Eighteen years after their discovery, the astronomical sources and radiation
mechanisms of fast radio bursts remain mysterious. Their radiation is as bright
as that of pulsars, with brightness temperatures as high as $\sim 10^{36}$ K,
implying coherent emission, but the plasma physics that forms the coherent
charge bunches, with net charges of order a Coulomb, is not understood. Some
FRB have been identified with galaxies at redshifts of a few tenths, but one
originated within a globular cluster in the galaxy M81 at a distance of 3.6
Mpc. A minority of FRB have been observed to repeat, in some cases thousands of
times. The vast majority of FRB have not been observed to repeat, but it is not
known if they are truly ``one-offs'' or repeat at unobservably long intervals.
Some FRB originate within dense, rapidly varying, plasma environments, while
others appear to be surrounded by high vacuum. Hypotheses for their sources
include magnetars and black hole accretion discs.

*Eleonora Caruso,Elisa Costantini,Nathalie Degenaar,Maria Diaz Trigo*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Analyzes the accretion disk dynamics in the NS LMXB 4U 1624-490, revealing a multiphase, clumpy bulge with over 7,000 clumps and a highly ionized disk atmosphere influenced by ionized and cold absorbers during dipping events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the physical properties (e.g., multiphase composition, clumpiness) of the impact bulge in accretion disks and understand its role in disk dynamics, atmospheric structure, and potential connection to disk winds via spectral analysis of dipping neutron star LMXBs.

Method: Spectral analysis using four XMM EPIC pn observations targeting dips in 4U 1624-490 across multiple timescales (orbital periods and ~6 months). Employed time- and flux-resolved spectroscopy to probe bulge structure and homogeneity, modeling ionized and cold absorbers during dipping phases.

Result: Identified a multiphase clumpy absorber (logξ~3.4) with varying column density in the bulge, estimating >7×10³ clumps. Discovered a highly ionized disk atmosphere only when analyzing absorption phases separately, suggesting complex plasma structures.

Conclusion: Demonstrated feasibility of studying bulge properties, emphasizing future studies to correlate bulge characteristics with system parameters and assess their impact on accretion disk dynamics and disk wind phenomena.

Abstract: Dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) are systems that
exhibit periodic drops in their X-ray light curves. These are believed to be
caused by material at the impact point of the gas stream onto the accretion
disk, the bulge. Dipping systems are observed at high inclination and provide
exceptional opportunities to address important open questions about accretion
disks, such as the physical properties of the bulge, and the connection between
disk atmospheres and disk winds. We aimed to characterize the accretion disk
plasmas present in the 21h-period NS LMXB 4U 1624-490, and perform a detailed
spectral analysis of the material present at the impact region. We used four
XMM EPIC pn observations that were specifically targeting dips, and allow us to
probe dipping activity over different timescales (i.e. consecutive orbits and
$\sim$6 months). We use both time- and flux-resolved spectroscopic analysis to
probe the structural properties of the bulge moving along the line of sight and
its homogeneity, respectively. During dipping, the primary spectrum is
modulated by an ionized (log$\xi\sim$ 3.4) absorber with varying column density
and covering factor, as well as a colder absorber. This suggests that the bulge
is a multiphase and clumpy absorbing medium. From size scale arguments, we
estimate the number of clumps in the bulge to be $>$7$\times10^{3}$. A highly
ionized disk atmosphere becomes evident only when different phases of
absorption are analyzed individually. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
constructing a physical picture of the bulge, and highlights how future
research could reveal how its properties depend on system parameters, and
whether the bulge could influence the dynamics of the accretion disk.

### [12] [Anomalous scattering of pulsars towards the Gum Nebula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19388)
*M. A. Krishnakumar,Bhal Chandra Joshi,P. K. Manoharan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses the upgraded GMRT to measure scatter-broadening of 14 pulsars near the Gum nebula, finding a strong distance-scattering correlation. For pulsars beyond 2 kpc, the Gum's impact on scattering/DM weakens. The Vela pulsar shows unique scattering likely from the Vela SNR instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand measurements of scattering properties in the Gum nebula region and determine the nebula's influence on distant pulsars versus nearby structures like the Vela SNR.

Method: Wideband scatter-broadening analysis of 14 pulsars using GMRT Band-3 data, focusing on frequency scaling index α (alpha).

Result: Tripled α measurements across the Gum nebula. Strong correlation between distance and scattering strength. Scattering effect diminishes beyond 2 kpc. Vela pulsar's flat α suggests scattering from Vela SNR, not Gum nebula.

Conclusion: Gum nebula primarily affects nearby pulsars within 2 kpc. Unique scattering sources require careful consideration of localized supernova remnants like the Vela SNR.

Abstract: We report wideband scatter-broadening estimates of 14 pulsars towards the Gum
nebula region using the Band-3 of the upgraded GMRT. This work increases the
measurements of frequency scaling index of scatter-broadening ($\alpha$) across
the nebula by more than 3 times. A strong correlation between the distance and
the scattering strength is observed for pulsars behind the nebula. It is also
observed that for distant pulsars ($> 2 kpc$), the effect of the Gum nebula in
DM and scattering strength is not substantial. We also report a much flatter
$\alpha$ for the Vela pulsar and argue that its scattering is not caused by the
Gum nebula, but the Vela supernova remnant.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This thesis develops novel mathematical methods, including graph theory and topology, to analyze pulsar populations. These methods enable dimensionality reduction, revealing new pulsar classifications, binary subclasses, and similarities in gamma-ray light curves, offering advanced tools for high-energy astrophysics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional visualization techniques in pulsar analysis and provide new classification and computational approaches.

Method: Employs graph theory, topological data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and a new time-series alignment technique for gamma-ray pulsar light curves.

Result: Identified new pulsar classes, potential binary subsystems, and similarities in gamma-ray light curves; demonstrated unsupervised machine learning capabilities via graph theory.

Conclusion: The methods establish a new foundation for pulsar population visualization and classification, offering promising pathways for rigorous mathematical analysis in high-energy astrophysics.

Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce novel methods for analyzing pulsar populations
using a variety of mathematical techniques. These tools-particularly graph
theory-have been thoroughly validated in advanced mathematics, enabling us to
overcome some of the constraints (even dimensional) inherent in conventional
visualization approaches. This exploration benefits from dimensionality
reduction techniques, which not only lessen computational demands but also
highlight potential for describing physical characteristics. The resulting
structures encode information about pulsar similarities that extend beyond
standard spin parameters, revealing relationships that are not readily apparent
in traditional diagrams. With a physically motivated topological perspective,
we leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from
prospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog
comparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh
interpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for
visualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this,
we identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and
investigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend
the use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its
capability for binary separation in an unsupervised context. Finally, we
introduce and apply an innovative, flexible time-series alignment technique to
the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The method identifies notable similarities
among the light curves of gamma-ray pulsars. The results presented here are
promising, offering a refreshing direction for the field and new pathways for
rigorous mathematical analysis, ultimately providing meaningful alternatives to
traditional approaches in high-energy astrophysics.

### [14] [The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19443)
*Adithya Nandakumar,Ricarda S. Beckmann,Vid Irsic*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how time-varying mass accretion onto spinning black holes affects their long-term spin evolution through superradiance induced by an axion field. Simulations show that pre-superradiance accretion boosts (especially super-Eddington rates) significantly delay or reshape the spin-down phase, reducing exclusion regions in the mass-spin plane. Post-superradiance boosts have minimal lasting impact. Axion cloud mass influences sensitivity: lighter clouds are more responsive to early accretion changes, while heavier ones require stronger or longer boosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how variable accretion histories and axion-cloud interactions modify black hole spin evolution over cosmic timescales, particularly addressing gaps in previous studies that often assumed constant accretion rates. The goal is to refine models predicting black hole mass-spin distributions observable via gravitational waves or electromagnetic observations.

Method: Numerical simulations tracking black hole spin dynamics under time-dependent accretion scenarios with superradiance effects from axion fields. Key parameters include accretion rate variability (pre vs post-superradiance timing), duration, strength (e.g., 5x Eddington over 4 Myr), and axion cloud mass. Evolution equations account for angular momentum competition between accretion gains and superradiance losses.

Result: Critical findings include 40% reduction in superradiance exclusion zones via well-timed (30 Myr prior) super-Eddington accretion. Pre-drop accretion delays spin-down phases while post-drop boosts only cause temporary spin changes. Light axion clouds (lower mass) show prolonged observable spin variations (10-100 Myr timescales) from early boosts, whereas heavy axion clouds need stronger/longer accretion events for similar effects.

Conclusion: Variable accretion histories significantly influence black hole spin distributions through superradiance modulation. Early accretion boosts reshape exclusion regions in mass-spin plane observables. Axion cloud properties (mass) determine system responsiveness, suggesting that observed black hole populations could indicate historical accretion variability and axion field characteristics. Future models require incorporating time-varying accretion to accurately predict spin behaviors.

Abstract: This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly
spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by
superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a
surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden
accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop)
during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains
nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition
between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion,
and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that
boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest
effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the
region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In
particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion,
lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce
the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In
contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause
temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes
with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show
observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier
axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to
produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.

### [15] [Interacting supernovae and where to find them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19446)
*Robert Brose,Iurii Sushch,Jonathan Mackey,Maria Arias*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The interaction of supernova blast waves with dense circumstellar medium (CSM) shells can significantly enhance gamma-ray emission, peaking weeks to years post-explosion, with luminosities orders of magnitude higher than smooth wind scenarios. Multiwavelength observations and strategic monitoring are proposed for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in detecting PeV particle acceleration via supernova-CSM interactions and improve models by incorporating complex CSM structures instead of assuming smooth stellar winds.

Method: Using the PION code to model CSM around LBVs and RSGs with dense shells, followed by the RATPaC code to simulate cosmic ray acceleration and radiation across electromagnetic spectra in these environments.

Result: CSM shell interactions boost gamma-ray emission, with peak luminosities exceeding smooth wind models by orders of magnitude (e.g., years-delayed peaks for Type-IIP SNe). Multiwavelength signatures from radio to X-rays are evaluated.

Conclusion: High-cadence optical surveys and radio/mm monitoring of nearby SNe are crucial for identifying targets for gamma-ray follow-up. Detectability ranges up to tens of Mpc for early interactions, enabling observational strategies.

Abstract: Early interaction of supernova blast waves with CSM has the potential to
accelerate particles to PeV energies, although this has not yet been detected.
Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth
stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption.
  We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density
profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances
from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength
signatures of CSM interaction.
  We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode
of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined
shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code
RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these
media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic
spectrum.
  We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the
gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the
explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed
the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP
explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We
evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the
blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays.
  We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby
SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying
targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories. We predict that
gamma-rays from interaction with dense CSM shells may be detectable out to a
few Mpc for late interaction, and tens of Mpc for early interaction.

### [16] [Can we ignore the time dependence in matter neutrino resonance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19485)
*Owais Ullah Faiz,Mushahid Hussain,Shashank Shalgar*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines neutrino flavor evolution in neutron star mergers using time-independent and time-dependent methods, showing that the steady-state assumption is flawed as it produces unstable solutions that don't match dynamic simulations, necessitating a re-evaluation of previous interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the validity of the steady-state assumption in modeling matter neutrino resonance (MNR) during NSMs, as prior studies used this simplification but its accuracy was untested in dynamic environments.

Method: Reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent (steady-state) and time-dependent formalisms to compare flavor survival probabilities and system dynamics.

Result: Time-independent approaches yield unstable steady-state solutions divergent from time-dependent results, indicating steady-state models fail to capture true dynamical behavior.

Conclusion: The steady-state assumption is invalid for MNR in dense neutrino systems, requiring reconsideration of physical interpretations derived from time-independent analyses in astrophysical studies.

Abstract: In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the
neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading
to matter neutrino resonance (MNR). MNR is one of the most interesting
mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical
environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor
field evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other
self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform
reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent
formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival
probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state
solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in
time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state
assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on
time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.

### [17] [Probing Accretion Disk Winds of Stratified Nature with Fe XXVI Doublet in Black Hole X-ray Binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19539)
*Keigo Fukumura,Shoji Ogawa,Atsushi Tanimoto,Francesco Tombesi,Alfredo Luminari,Maxime Parra,Megumi Shidatsu,Liyi Gu,Ehud Behar*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Fe XXVI doublet line profiles to probe the density and kinematics of ionized accretion disk winds in Galactic black hole transients, demonstrating how different velocity dispersions result in distinct spectral features observable with high-resolution instruments like XRISM/Resolve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the physical properties of accretion disk winds using the unique spectral signature of Fe XXVI doublet lines, which vary based on wind density and velocity dispersion.

Method: Simulated doublet spectra using a magnetic disk wind model with stratified density and velocity structures, combined with post-process radiative transfer calculations to predict line profiles under different velocity dispersion scenarios.

Result: Three distinct line profiles were identified corresponding to high (>5000 km/s), moderate (1000-5000 km/s), and low (<1000 km/s) velocity dispersions, which match observations from XRISM/Resolve. This allows measuring wind density and velocity dispersion.

Conclusion: Fe XXVI doublet profiles are effective diagnostics for wind density and kinematics, providing constraints on local wind physics and supporting the stratified magnetic wind model.

Abstract: Powerful ionized accretion disk winds are often observed during episodic
outbursts in Galactic black hole transients. Among those X-ray absorbers,
\fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart)
has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the
wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a
physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in
density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized
as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion
(due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our
simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations
indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher
velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2
canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$)
or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity
dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing
various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously
seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution.
We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the
local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale,
stratified wind.

*Yi Hua Lam,Ning Lu,Alexander Heger,Zi Xin Liu,Zac Johnston,Hidetoshi Yamaguchi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of updated thermonuclear reaction rates for $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As on models of two X-ray bursters (GS 1826-24 and SAX J1808.4-3658). The new rates derived from experimental and shell-model calculations show modest effects on GS 1826-24 light curves but significant influence on SAX J1808.4-3658 bursts, highlighting the latter's sensitivity to nuclear reaction uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how revisions in reaction rates for proton capture reactions affect astrophysical models of X-ray bursts, particularly their ability to reproduce observed properties (e.g., burst peak, fluence, recurrence time) and address discrepancies with previous claims about their impact.

Method: The authors applied updated reaction rates (from Lu et al. 2024) to the KEPLER hydrodynamics code for two neutron star X-ray bursters. They compared model outputs with observational data from GS 1826-24 (clocked burster) and SAX J1808.4-3658 (photospheric radius expansion burster), testing sensitivity under different reaction rate assumptions.

Result: The new Ga-Ger reaction rates had limited effect on GS 1826-24's light curves, contradicting Zhou et al. (2023)'s expectations but showed clear influence on SAX J1808.4-3658's bursts. The latter's 2002 epoch models depend strongly on reaction rate uncertainties, especially considering optional inclusion of $^{22}$Mg($\alpha$,p)$^{25}$Al revisions.

Conclusion: The updated reaction rates significantly influence certain X-ray burst models (SAX J1808), challenging previous interpretations. This emphasizes the need for precise nuclear data to accurately model explosive astrophysical events and underscores the sensitivity of photospheric radius expansion burst characteristics to nuclear physics uncertainties.

Abstract: The $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As
thermonuclear reactions connect the ZnGa and GeAs cycles by diverting the flow
of the rapid proton capture process from $^{63}$Ga to $^{65}$As. Changes in
these two reaction rates regulate the ZnGa and GeAs cycles and may affect the
modeled properties matching with the observed counterparts of a type I X-ray
burster. We implement the latest $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and
$^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates to the state-of-the-art
self-consistent one-dimensional multi-zone thermo-hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to
study the influence of these new reaction rates on the models of the GS
1826$-$24 clocked burster and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion
burster. Both new reaction rates obtained by Lu et al. [Phys. Rev. C 110,
065804 (2024)] are determined from complementing the experimental input with
the nuclear spectroscopic information deduced from the full pf-shell space
configuration-interaction shell-model calculations. By constraining the models
on reproducing the observed burst peak, light-curve profile, fluence, and
recurrence time, we find that the impact of the newly measured proton
thresholds and respective proton-capture reactions on the burst light-curve
profile of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster is, in fact, not as significant as
claimed by Zhou et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 1091 (2023)]. With or without the
inclusion of the newly determined reaction rate of the highly influential
$^{22}$Mg($\alpha$,p)$^{25}$Al reaction, the impact of the new
$^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction
rates on SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts is evident.
Our finding indicates that the models reproducing the 2002 October epoch of SAX
J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster is more sensitive to the
uncertainties of thermonuclear reaction rates.

*Yilong Wang,B. F. Liu,Mingjun Liu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explores accretion in black hole X-ray binaries by considering simultaneous cold and hot gas supplies, analyzing disc-corona interactions through energy coupling and matter exchange. It links accretion rate and gas composition to spectral states and validates findings with Cygnus X-1 observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain observed spectral variations in intermediate states and understand how accretion geometry transitions between disc-dominated (soft state) and corona-dominated (hard state) based on gas supply rates and composition.

Method: Semi-analytical modeling of disc-corona interactions, focusing on energy coupling and matter exchange (corona condensation/disc evaporation). Parameters include accretion rates (percentage of Eddington) and cold/hot gas ratios.

Result: Accretion geometry and spectra depend heavily on total gas supply and cold/hot ratio. At ~Eddington 1-3%, varied geometries explain intermediate spectra. Higher rates (>few percent Eddington) yield disc dominance (soft state); very low rates (<1%) produce hot-flow dominated hard states. Viscosity parameter constrained to 0.25-0.35 via MAXI data.

Conclusion: Simultaneous cold/hot accretion explains multi-state spectral behavior in black hole binaries. The viscosity parameter constraint aligns observations with theoretical models, highlighting the role of accretion rate and composition in determining system state.

Abstract: Accretion in black hole X-ray binaries is commonly believed to be supplied by
the Roche lobe overflow or the stellar wind. The former is thought to form a
geometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick
hot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case,
i.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a
corona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by
analysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona
condensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that
the accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission
spectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of
cold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington
value, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the
fraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various
spectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates,
regardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always
disc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at
very low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is
expected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of
Cygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion
flow to the range of 0.25--0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI
observations.

*Washington R. Carvalho Jr.,Lech Piotrowski*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field
amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere,
even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an
$X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this
implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF
shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained
in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes
with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is
a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density
scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other
scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the
core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper
showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to
larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at
higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the
deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time
delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.
This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic
field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission
with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF
amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly
infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary
composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions
on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm
max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.

*P. Peñil,N. Torres-Albà,A. Rico,S. Buson,M. Ajello,A. Domínguez,S. Adhikari*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines how data gaps affect time series analysis of blazar emissions, finding that over 50% gaps degrade period detection reliability. SSA outperforms other methods, and annual periodicities due to seasonal sampling cause false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the observational challenge of irregular sampling and data gaps in blazar emissions, which hinder the reliability of variability analysis methods.

Method: The study uses simulated and real data to evaluate methods like Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). They systematically assess how gaps impact variability patterns, periodic signal masking, and false periodicity.

Result: Results show significant degradation in period detection above 50% gaps. SSA remains robust. False annual periodicities arise from seasonal sampling biases.

Conclusion: SSA is recommended for high-gap data. Caution is needed to avoid false positives (e.g., one-year periods from seasonal effects). Periods with ≥3σ confidence are genuine, not stochastic or gap-induced.

Abstract: Time series analysis is fundamental to characterizing the variability
inherent in multi-wavelength emissions from blazars. However, a major
observational challenge lies in the need for well-sampled, temporally uniform
data, which is often hindered by irregular sampling and data gaps. These gaps
can significantly affect the reliability and accuracy of methods used to probe
source variability. This paper investigates the impact of such observational
gaps on time series analysis of blazar emissions. To do so, we systematically
evaluate how these gaps alter observed variability patterns, mask genuine
periodic signals, and introduce false periodicity detections. This evaluation
is conducted using both simulated and real observational data. We assess a
range of widely used time series analysis methods, including the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and the recently proposed Singular
Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Our results demonstrate a clear and significant
degradation in period detection reliability when the percentage of gaps exceeds
50\%. In such cases, the period-significance relationship becomes increasingly
distorted, often leading to misleading results. Among the tested methods, SSA
stands out for its ability to yield consistent and robust detections despite
high data incompleteness. Additionally, the analyzed methods tend to identify
artificial periodicities of around one year, likely due to seasonal sampling
effects, which can result in false positives if not carefully recognized.
Finally, the periods detected with $\geq$3$\sigma$ confidence are unlikely to
result from stochastic processes or from the presence of gaps in the analyzed
time series.

*Qi-Rui Yang,Xiao-Bin Chen,Ruo-Yu Liu,Xiang-Yu Wang,Martin Lemoine*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the potential of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 as a source of high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube, suggesting PeV proton acceleration through turbulence or magnetic reconnection in its corona. It compares the hard neutrino spectrum of NGC 7469 with the softer spectrum of NGC 1068, attributing differences to varying magnetization parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos, particularly the IceCube alerts IC220424A and IC230416A from NGC 7469, which exhibit harder spectra and higher energies than NGC 1068. The study aims to constrain the neutrino-emitting region size and acceleration mechanisms using Fermi-LAT data.

Method: Analyze Fermi-LAT observations of NGC 7469 (non-detection) to set upper limits on GeV cascade flux. Calculate proton acceleration scenarios (turbulence vs. reconnection) considering OUV/X-ray photon fields, magnetization parameters (σ ~1 or 10), and pair-dominated corona composition.

Result: NGC 7469's harder neutrino spectrum and lack of lower-energy neutrinos imply PeV proton acceleration. Constrain emission region size via cascade flux limits. Different magnetization parameters required for turbulence (σ~1) vs. reconnection (σ~10). Differences in spectra between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 linked to magnetization variations in similar AGN.

Conclusion: NGC 7469's high-energy neutrinos likely originate from PeV proton interactions in its corona via specified acceleration mechanisms. Magnetization differences between AGN explain spectral variations, suggesting magnetization's role in neutrino production efficiency across Seyferts.

Abstract: The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown.
The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy
NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable
candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a
potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this
source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated
by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and
IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV,
implying a maximum proton energy > 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC
1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino
spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT
observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade
flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV
flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the
neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons
are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the
corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and
X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with
energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required
maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to
unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization
parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated
composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino
spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different
magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.

Abstract: We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and
instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We
show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{\'e}n and oblique
magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes
affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor
oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear
Alfv{\'e}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying
instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming
neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well
as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the
profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on
the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.

Abstract: The electromagnetic production of a dilepton pair in the muon - ion
scattering, usually denoted muon trident process, is investigated considering
the feasibility of studying processes induced by muons at LHC using its
far-forward detectors. The total and differential cross - sections are
estimated taking into account of the Bethe-Heitler and bremsstrahlung channels,
and predictions for the event rates expected for muon - tungsten ($\mu W$)
collisions at the LHC energies are presented. Our results indicate that the
observation of the muon trident process is feasible at FASER$\nu$. In
particular, our results indicate that the electromagnetic production of $\tau^+
\tau^-$ pairs in the $\mu W$ scattering can, in principle, be observed for the
first time ever at the LHC. In addition, we present our predictions for the
production of QED bound states. Finally, results for the trident process at the
FASER$\nu$2 detector are also presented.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Axions that couple to nuclear spins via the axial current interaction can be
both produced and detected using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques.
In this scheme, nuclei driven by a real oscillating magnetic field in one
device act as an axion source, which can drive NMR in a nearby spin-polarized
sample interrogated with a sensitive magnetometer. We study the prospects for
detecting axions through this method and identify two key characteristics that
result in compelling detection sensitivity. First, the gradient of the
generated axion field can be substantial, set by the inverse distance from the
source. In the near zone, it reduces to the inverse of the source's geometric
size. Second, because the generated axion field is produced at a known
frequency, the detection medium can be tuned precisely to this frequency,
enabling long interrogation times. We show that the experimental sensitivity of
a pair of centimeter-scale NMR devices operating over a 15-day integration time
can already surpass existing astrophysical bounds on the axion-nucleon
coupling. A similar sensitivity can be achieved with 10 centimeter-scale NMR
devices with only 1 hour of integration time. These dual NMR configurations are
capable of probing a wide range of axion masses, up to values comparable to the
inverse distance between the source and the sensor.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop a unified resummation framework for heavy-meson pair
photoproduction that treats soft-gluon radiation in a massive scheme for
$|\boldsymbol q| \lesssim m_Q$ and is consistent with the massless limit $m_Q
\ll |\boldsymbol q|$, where $\boldsymbol q$ denotes the transverse momentum of
the pair and $m_Q$ the quark mass. This framework describes the full
correlation regime $|\boldsymbol q| \ll |\boldsymbol P|$, with $\boldsymbol P$
the pair's relative transverse momentum. Next, within the Color Glass
Condensate framework, we quantify the impact of soft gluon radiation on two
important phenomenological observables, namely, the azimuthal $\Delta\phi$
correlation and the harmonic asymmetries $\langle \cos(2n\phi_{qP})\rangle$.
Our results show that the resummation provides an excellent description of the
H1 $\Delta\phi$ data. We then find that the angular-asymmetry harmonics are
sizable and their ratios in $\gamma A$ to $\gamma p$ collisions are highly
sensitive to gluon saturation. We further find a clear mass hierarchy in both
observables, indicating that heavy-quark masses suppress soft radiation and
thereby enhance genuine small-$x$ saturation signals. Our work demonstrates
that heavy-quark pair photoproduction provides a quantitative probe of gluon
saturation, directly measurable in forthcoming EIC and UPC measurements.
Finally, the unified resummation is readily extendable to other processes
involving massive particles and jets in both $eA$ and $pA$ collisions.

*Joshua N. Benabou,Anson Hook,Claudio Andrea Manzari,Hitoshi Murayama,Benjamin R. Safdi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Strong CP problem by reevaluating existing solutions: gauged discrete symmetries that preserve CP and critiquing claims that the problem is illusory. It finds gauged discrete symmetries viable despite challenges and confirms the problem's validity through QCD dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Strong CP problem arises because the observed absence of a neutron EDM limits the QCD theta angle to an extraordinarily small value, requiring explanation to avoid fine-tuning. The paper seeks to assess proposed solutions and clarify the problem's legitimacy.

Method: 1. Analyzes gauged discrete symmetries as potential solutions, showing they inherently preserve CP. 2. Critiques recent arguments dismissing the Strong CP problem by demonstrating that a nonzero neutron EDM emerges naturally at finite theta through standard QCD mechanisms.

Result: Gauged discrete symmetries can in principle solve the Strong CP problem without fundamental issues, though model-building challenges remain. The problem is confirmed as genuine since a nonzero neutron EDM would manifest at a non-zero theta, which is not observed, necessitating a solution.

Conclusion: The Strong CP problem remains a significant unresolved issue in physics. Gauged discrete symmetries offer a plausible path to resolution, emphasizing the need for further exploration of such models while dismissing the notion that the problem is illusory.

Abstract: The absence of a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) constrains the quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) theta angle to be less than one part in ten billion,
posing the Strong $CP$ problem. We revisit two classes of proposed solutions.
First, we show that when $P$ or $CP$ is realized as a gauged discrete symmetry
- as can arise in quantum gravity - the vacuum necessarily preserves $CP$,
contrary to recent claims that discrete-symmetry solutions fail. Gauged
discrete models face model-building challenges, such as avoiding contributions
to the neutron EDM after spontaneous $P$ or $CP$ breaking, but in principle
have no fundamental obstructions. Second, we critically examine recent
arguments that the Strong $CP$ problem is illusory, demonstrating that a
nonzero neutron EDM at finite $\bar\theta$ follows directly from
well-understood QCD dynamics. Taken together, our results reinforce the reality
of the Strong $CP$ problem and highlight gauged discrete-symmetry realizations
of $P$ or $CP$ as plausible solutions.

### [28] [The $B^+ \to K^+ ν\bar ν$ decay as a search for the QCD axion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18953)
*Merna Abumusabh,Giulio Dujany,Diego Guadagnoli,Axel Iohner,Claudio Toni*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets the B+ → K+ ν¯ν measurement to probe B+ → K+ a decays, where 'a' is an axion or axion-like particle. By using a kinematic mapping of q² and publicly available efficiencies, they set improved bounds on the coupling-rescaled Peccei-Quinn scale, surpassing previous limits by an order of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore both standard and new physics contributions in B decay processes. The study aims to identify if axion-like particles (ALPs) could be produced in B decays and to improve constraints on their parameters using existing experimental data without relying on simulation-dependent assumptions.

Method: The authors analyze the B+ → K+ ν¯ν decay data using both Hadronic Tag Analysis (HTA) and Inclusive Tag Analysis (ITA). In ITA, they derive a kinematic relationship between the true q² (related to axion mass) and the reconstructed q²_rec variable. They utilize public experimental efficiencies to recast the existing Belle II bounds on ν¯ν processes into constraints on axion couplings.

Result: The study establishes the strongest existing bounds on the coupling-rescaled Peccei-Quinn scale, achieving |(F_V)_{sb}| ≥ 0.9 × 10^9 GeV. The result shows minimal dependence on the di-neutrino signal strength parameter μ_{ν¯ν}, whether fixed or floated.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that B+ → K+ ν¯ν serves as a dual probe for both short-distance new physics and axion-like particles. The method's independence from experimental simulations and its robust statistical power validate its effectiveness, offering a path for future high-sensitivity searches with more data.

Abstract: We reinterpret the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ measurement as a probe of the
decay $B^+ \to K^+ a$, where $a$ denotes an axion or axion-like particle. This
is possible in the kinematic regions where the di-neutrino invariant mass
squared, $q^2$, can be identified with the assumed $m_a^2$. While $q^2$ is
reconstructed only in the Hadronic Tag Analysis (HTA), it is not directly
accessible in the Inclusive Tag Analysis (ITA), which provides much larger
statistics and hence higher sensitivity. In ITA, $q^2$ is proxied by a
reconstructed variable, $q^2_{\text{rec}}$, usually modeled through Belle II
simulations. We show that the mapping between $q^2$ and $q^2_{\text{rec}}$ can
be accurately derived from kinematic arguments alone -- without relying on
internal experimental inputs. Using this relation and publicly available
efficiencies, we obtain the strongest existing bounds on the coupling-rescaled
Peccei-Quinn scale, $|(F_V)_{sb}| \ge 0.9 \times 10^9$ GeV, improving the
latest bound in the literature by an order of magnitude. We further show that
the bound depends only marginally on the assumed value of the di-neutrino
signal strength $\mu_{\nu{\bar\nu}}$, whether fixed or floated. This
establishes $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ as a double probe -- of new
short-distance physics in the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar\nu$ amplitude, and of new
light, elusive particles produced via $B^+ \to K^+ a$ -- the two probes working
independently to an excellent approximation.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the application of various functional methods in quantum field theories, focusing on their use in particle physics, common truncation methods, and solution techniques, exemplified by calculating the glueball spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of functional methods and demonstrate their practical implementation in particle physics through the example of glueball spectrum calculations, addressing the need for nonperturbative approaches in quantum field theory.

Method: The paper uses functional methods including Dyson-Schwinger equations, nPI effective action, bound state equations, and functional renormalization group. It examines truncation strategies and solution techniques, applying these to compute the glueball spectrum.

Result: The analysis shows how truncations affect the accuracy of nonperturbative calculations and validates the methods by successfully computing glueball masses, illustrating the pathway from theoretical truncation choices to physical observables.

Conclusion: Functional methods offer powerful nonperturbative tools for quantum field theories when appropriately truncated, with the glueball spectrum example demonstrating their effectiveness in particle physics applications. Further refinement of truncation schemes is suggested for broader reliability.

Abstract: Functional methods like Dyson-Schwinger equations, the nPI effective action
formalism, bound state equations and the functional renormalization group are
versatile tools to study quantum field theories. They are exact,
nonperturbative equations but have to be truncated for practical calculations.
After a general introduction, I focus on their use in particle physics and
discuss common truncations and solution techniques. The complete process from
choosing a truncation to calculating observable quantities is exemplified by
means of the glueball spectrum.

Abstract: We present a simple and broadly applicable extension of the Casas-Ibarra
parametrisation that captures the structure of all Majorana neutrino mass
models. Building directly on the original formulation, our approach naturally
accommodates additional degrees of freedom and provides a unified, minimal
framework for parametrising the Yukawa sector. It significantly simplifies both
analytical treatments and numerical scans, and can be universally applied to
any Majorana neutrino mass model, regardless of the underlying dynamics. The
approach also offers a unified framework for classifying neutrino mass models
according to the structure of the neutrino mass matrix, which naturally
motivates the proposal of an extended version of the Scotogenic Model. This
classification scheme yields tree-level (loop-level) representative models: the
seesaw (Scotogenic Model), the linear seesaw (the Generalised Scotogenic
Model), and the linear plus inverse seesaw (the Extended Scotogenic Model). We
provide ready-to-use explicit expressions for several well-known scenarios,
including the Zee model where one of the Yukawa matrices is antisymmetric.

*Tushar Gupta,Matti Heikinheimo,Katri Huitu,Harri Waltari*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores whether light higgsinos can saturate the relic density bound in the MSSM extended with right-handed neutrino superfields. It concludes that this scenario is ruled out due to the overabundance of sterile neutrinos produced via the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism, whose long lifetime would lead to an excessive relic density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the viability of scenarios where both freeze-out of higgsinos and freeze-in of right-handed sneutrinos contribute to dark matter, particularly focusing on the relic density constraints and the potential issues arising from the decay of heavy species to lighter ones.

Method: The authors analyze the extended MSSM model with right-handed neutrinos, considering the production mechanisms of both higgsinos via freeze-out and right-handed sneutrinos via freeze-in. They examine the decay processes between the heavier and lighter dark matter candidates and assess the impact of the sterile neutrino abundance and lifetime on the relic density.

Result: The key result is the exclusion of the considered scenario across all seesaw models. The overproduction of sterile neutrinos via the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism results in a lifetime exceeding the universe's age, causing significant relic density contributions beyond observed limits.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that scenarios combining freeze-out higgsinos and freeze-in right-handed sneutrinos are invalid because the decay of overly abundant sterile neutrinos would violate relic density bounds, thus ruling out such models for dark matter.

Abstract: We investigate the possibility of saturating the relic density bound with
light higgsinos. When the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is extended
with right-handed neutrino superfields and the seesaw scale is very low,
right-handed sneutrinos can be produced via the freeze-in mechanism. In such a
case we can have essentially two independent sources for dark matter, the
traditional freeze-out of higgsinos and the freeze-in of right-handed
sneutrinos. The heavier of these two will decay to the lighter species with a
delay. We rule out such a scenario for all seesaw models as the lifetime of
sterile neutrinos, produced over-abundantly via Dodelson-Widrow mechanism,
exceeds the age of the universe and will contribute to the relic density.

Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the spurion analysis of non-invertible
selection rules (NISRs) arising from near-group fusion algebras, we further
generalize the framework to a class of NISRs obtained from $\mathbb{Z}_2$
orbifolding of a $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetry, denoted as
$\mathbb{Z}_M/\mathbb{Z}_2$. Many structural features are carried over: for
instance, our labeling scheme enables systematic tracking of all couplings when
constructing composite amplitudes from simpler building blocks at arbitrary
loop orders in perturbation theory. Our analysis provides a transparent
understanding of both low-order and all-order zeros of couplings under
radiative corrections. Furthermore, we examine the fate of low-order zeros when
the fusion algebra is not faithfully realized -- a situation not captured by
the vanilla argument of ``loop-induced groupification'' -- and formulate a
conjecture on the related aspects of particle decoupling and effective theory.
Finally, we discuss the low-order versus all-order zeros in Yukawa textures
from the perspective of spurion analysis.

### [34] [Stellar cooling limits on KK gravitons and dark dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18975)
*Edward Hardy,Anton Sokolov,Henry Stubbs*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper revisits cooling bounds on light Kaluza-Klein gravitons in the dark dimension scenario by analyzing red giants, neutron stars, and supernovae. New production channels—resonant photon mixing and pion-induced processes in supernovae—are considered. SN1987A data yield a KK mass scale bound of ~0.6 eV (2D) or ~500 eV (3D). Pion process emissivity exceeds bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few. Future pion understanding could strengthen limits. For 1D, lab searches are tighter. KK graviton decay constraints are weaker than cooling bounds under standard assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine cooling constraints on light KK gravitons by incorporating additional production channels (resonant photon mixing and pion-induced processes), addressing gaps in prior studies. Improving bounds on the KK mass scale is critical for models with extra dimensions, testing dark dimension scenarios against astrophysical observations.

Method: Analyzes thermal emission from stellar objects (red giants, neutron stars, supernovae) considering three cooling channels: bremsstrahlung, resonant in-medium photon mixing, and pion-induced emission in supernovae. Uses SN1987A neutrino data to derive constraints on KK graviton mass. Compares emissivity across channels and dimensions.

Result: SN1987A provides strongest bounds: m_KK > 0.6 eV (2D), 500 eV (3D). Pion process is more emissive than bremsstrahlung in supernovae. KK decay constraints are weaker unless KK number violation is reduced. Potential for tighter bounds with better pion physics knowledge in supernovae.

Conclusion: Astrophysical cooling analyses significantly constrain dark dimension models, especially for 2/3D. Enhanced astrophysical modeling (particularly pion processes) may further tighten bounds. Laboratory tests still dominate in the 1D case. Future observations could improve constraints from KK decays if KK number violation assumptions are relaxed.

Abstract: We revisit cooling bounds on light Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, as arise in
the dark dimension scenario, considering red giants, neutron stars, and
supernovae. In addition to bremsstrahlung, we account for two novel production
channels: resonant mixing with the in-medium photon and a pion-induced process
in supernovae. The strongest limits arise from SN 1987A, with the emissivity
from the pion process exceeding that from bremsstrahlung by a factor of a few.
Given present uncertainties, we obtain a bound on the KK mass scale of $m_{\rm
KK}\gtrsim 0.6\,{\rm eV}$ $(\gtrsim 500\,{\rm eV})$ for 2 (3) extra dimensions.
Improved understanding of the properties of pions in supernovae could
strengthen these limits to roughly ${\rm eV}$ $({\rm keV})$. For 1 extra
dimension, the bounds are weaker than those from laboratory searches. We also
show that constraints from KK graviton decays to Standard Model particles are
less stringent than the cooling bounds if there is KK number violation at the
level typically assumed in the dark dimension scenario, although these bounds
could be strengthened by future observations.

Abstract: We numerically study the formation of the gauge-mediation type Q balls in the
logarithmic square potential on three-dimensional lattices. We obtain the broad
charge distribution of the Q ball of this type for the first time. The charge
of the Q ball at the peak of the distribution is smaller than what we estimated
as the average of the largest tens of the Q balls in the logarithmic potential
for the same initial amplitude of the field at the onset of its oscillation. We
also discuss some impacts of the broad distribution on cosmology and
astrophysics. In the B ball (Q being the baryon number) case, the broad
distribution would lead to the coexistence of both stable and unstable B balls.
We find that stable B balls can account for the dark matter of the universe
without affecting successful big bang nucleosynthesis by the decay of the
unstable B balls, but the baryon number of the universe cannot be explained by
them. On the other hand, the large L balls (Q being the lepton number) would be
the dark matter as well while avoiding the constraints on the X and/or gamma
rays from the decay of the smaller L balls.

*P. Chakraborty,G. Kornakov,A. Kisiel,Yu. M. Sinyukov,V. M. Shapoval,S. Dash*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study compares two models (iHKM and LQTH) to understand the role of hadronic interactions in cooling deconfined matter droplets. Both models show emission asymmetries and radii scaling with particle multiplicity. iHKM matches data well, while LQTH needs parameter adjustments, emphasizing the need for hadronic interactions in modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how interactions in the hadronic phase influence particle emission asymmetries and scaling behaviors, particularly between pions and kaons, during the cooling of deconfined matter. The goal is to determine the necessity of incorporating hadronic interactions in theoretical models.

Method: Two models—iHKM (full evolution description) and LQTH (sudden hadron conversion without further interactions)—are analyzed at √sNN =5.02 TeV. The study examines pair transverse velocity as a function of multiplicity, comparing predictions with ALICE data at 2.76 TeV. Focus is on emission asymmetries, radii scaling, and non-monotonic behavior.

Result: Both models show scaling of radii and asymmetries with multiplicity. iHKM qualitatively and quantitatively matches data. LQTH requires kaon emission time delays for agreement. Non-monotonic asymmetry trends and constant scaling ratio of asymmetry/radii vs. multiplicity observed.

Conclusion: Hadronic phase interactions are crucial for accurately describing emission dynamics. Models neglecting these interactions (e.g., LQTH) need adjustments, underscoring the importance of complete phase descriptions (like iHKM) for predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Emission asymmetries between pions and kaons reflect the role of the hadronic
phase in the cooling of a droplet of deconfined strongly-interacting matter.
This study compares results from two models at the same collision energy of
$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV to investigate how interactions in the
hadronic phase affect particle emission. The first model, iHKM, provides a
complete description of all stages of the evolution; from the initial
scattering and thermalization to the final hadronic state, while the second
model, LQTH (LHYQUID+THERMINATOR2), assumes a sudden conversion into hadrons,
neglecting further interactions. To increase the sensitivity to hadronic
interactions, the analysis was performed as a function of the pair transverse
velocity for pairs with nearly equal velocity vectors. The obtained predictions
are compared with previously measured ALICE data at
$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV as a function of the cube root of the average
particle multiplicity density at midrapidity, showing that both radii and
emission asymmetries scale with particle multiplicity, regardless of the
collision energy. The iHKM model reproduces the measured trends both
qualitatively and quantitatively, whereas the LQTH model requires additional
parameters-in particular, a time delay in the emission of kaons-to achieve
quantitative agreement. The comparative analysis also indicates a possible
non-monotonic behavior of the asymmetry as a function of transverse velocity,
and a constant scaling of the ratio between the emission asymmetry and
femtoscopic radii with particle multiplicity. These results highlight the
importance of including interactions in the hadronic stage for a complete
description of the emission function.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new observable, p_T-differential radial flow v₀(p_T) in heavy-quark sector to study heavy quark-bulk interactions, constrain transport coefficients in the QGP, and evaluate collective behavior and hadronization mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for novel tools to quantify heavy quark interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and understand their collective behavior and hadronization processes in heavy-ion collisions.

Method: Utilizes an event-by-event Langevin framework to analyze the p_T-differential radial flow v₀(p_T), focusing on how heavy quarks interact with the expanding QGP medium.

Result: v₀(p_T) shows strong sensitivity to heavy quark-bulk interactions, enabling constrained determination of transport coefficients. It demonstrates heavy quark collective behavior driven by QGP expansion and reveals a distinct hadronization signature at low p_T.

Conclusion: The observable v₀(p_T) is a powerful tool for studying heavy quark dynamics in the QGP, providing insights into interaction strengths, collective effects, and the transition to hadrons during collisions.

Abstract: We introduce the $p_T$-differential radial flow $v_0(p_T)$ in the heavy-quark
sector. Within an event-by-event Langevin framework, we show that this
observable exhibits a strong sensitivity to the heavy quark-bulk interaction.
It provides a powerful and novel tool to constrain the transport coefficients
of heavy quarks in the QGP and, more generally, to assess the strength of the
interaction of a Brownian particle in an expanding bulk medium. The results
further indicate that heavy quarks exhibit collective behavior driven by the
isotropic expansion of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions and, at low $p_T$, it
offers a marked signature of the heavy quark hadronization mechanism.

standard and non-standard theories of the electroweak interactions. In the
present article, our goal is to explore the possibility of using the molybdenum
material as detection medium for coherent and incoherent antineutrino- and
neutrino- Mo scattering in the ongoing and future coherent elastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE{\nu}NS) exper- iments by using relevant
(anti-)neutrino beams as e.g. stopped pion-decay neutrino beams, reactor
antineutrino beams, astrophysical (solar or supernova) (anti)neutrino beams,
etc. Our present co- herent and incoherent scattering cross sections of Mo
isotopes with neutrinos and antineutrinos are based on the deformed shell model
(DSM) that has been previously employed for studying similar processes. On the
other hand, in the past, CE{\nu}NS events obtained with this model provided us
with better fits to COHERENT experimental data compared to phenomenological
form factors.

Abstract: In this work, expanding on previous analyses, we employ an effective
Lagrangian approach to investigate the mass spectrum of scalar and pseudoscalar
mesons at finite temperature, above the (pseudo-)critical temperature $T_c$, in
a "realistic" $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavor scenario with degenerate $up$ and $down$
quarks and a heavier $strange$ quark: $0 < m_u = m_d \ll m_s$. The model's
predictions are then critically compared with available lattice QCD results
(where meson screening masses are extracted from chiral susceptibilities, which
correspond to two-point correlation functions of suitable interpolating
operators), looking, in particular, for signatures of the breaking of the
$U(1)$ axial symmetry above $T_c$.

### [41] [The strong coupling from the IR to the UV extremes: Determination of $α_s$ and prospects from EIC and JLab at 22 GeV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19556)
*A. Deur*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores using the Bjorken sum rule to determine the QCD running coupling α_s across a wide range of energy scales, extending into the deep infrared. It combines existing Jefferson Lab data with global α_s measurements to map α_s(Q) over five orders of magnitude in Q. Future measurements at the EIC and upgraded Jefferson Lab are proposed to further refine α_s in intermediate and lower Q regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To precisely determine the running of the QCD coupling constant α_s at all energy scales, including the less-explored deep infrared regime, and to outlines experimental strategies for improving these determinations in upcoming facilities.

Method: Analyzed existing Bjorken sum data from Jefferson Lab and α_s data from the Particle Data Group to map α_s(Q) across five orders of magnitude. Proposed future experiments using the Bjorken sum rule at the EIC (Q=1.5-8.7 GeV) and Jefferson Lab at 22 GeV (Q=1.0-4.7 GeV) to extend measurements into intermediate and lower Q regions.

Result: Demonstrated the feasibility of extracting α_s across a broad energy range using existing data, and showed how planned experiments would fill key gaps in coverage between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD regimes.

Conclusion: Future measurements at next-generation facilities will provide crucial constraints on α_s in the critical infrared-to-ultraviolet transition region, improving our understanding of QCD dynamics and the reliability of extrapolations in particle physics calculations.

Abstract: We discuss how the Bjorken sum rule allows access to the QCD running coupling
$\alpha_s$ at any scale, including in the deep infrared IR domain. The Bjorken
sum data from Jefferson Lab, together with the world data on $\alpha_s$
reported by the Particle Data Group, allow us to determine the running of
$\alpha_s(Q)$ over five orders of magnitude in four-momentum $Q$. We present
two possible future measurements of the running of $\alpha_s(Q)$ using the
Bjorken sum rule: the first at the EIC, covering the range $1.5 < Q < 8.7$ GeV,
and the second at Jefferson Lab at 22 GeV, covering the range $1.0 < Q < 4.7$
GeV.

### [42] [Interpreting the 650 GeV and 95 GeV Higgs Anomalies in the N2HDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19605)
*Rachid Benbrik,Mohammed Boukidi,Khouloud Kahime,Stefano Moretti,Larbi Rahili,Bassim Taki*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores whether the N2HDM can explain observed LHC and LEP excesses via a 650 GeV CP-even Higgs decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs and a 95 GeV scalar, finding compatibility within Type-II and Type-Y models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent LHC and LEP anomaly observations (95 GeV di-photon/ττ/bb̄ excesses and a 650 GeV γγbb̄ resonance) motivate testing if the N2HDM can unify these signals.

Method: Parameter scans of N2HDM Type-II and Type-Y models incorporating gluon-gluon fusion production, decay modes to 125 GeV + 95 GeV scalars, and experimental constraints.

Result: A 650 GeV Higgs decaying into 125 GeV + 95 GeV scalars is compatible with N2HDM frameworks at 2σ significance, aligning with collider data.

Conclusion: The N2HDM provides a viable explanation for multi-excess anomalies, offering testable predictions for future LHC runs.

Abstract: Recent experimental hints from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in di-photon
and partially in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states suggest the possible existence
of an additional Higgs boson with a mass around 95 GeV. Interestingly, these
observations are consistent with earlier results from the Large
Electron-Positron (LEP) collider, which pointed to an excess in $b\bar b$ final
states within a similar mass range. Additionally, CMS has observed an excess in
the $\gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$ final state, indicating a possible resonance near
650 GeV decaying into a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons or into a SM-like Higgs
boson accompanied by a lighter scalar with mass near 95 GeV. In this work, we
investigate whether these anomalies can be simultaneously explained within the
Next-to-2-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM), an extension of the Standard Model (SM)
scalar sector featuring two complex Higgs doublets and an additional real
singlet. Assuming the existence of a CP-even Higgs state compatible with the 95
GeV excesses (restricted to the $\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar b$ channels), we
analyse the Type-II and Type-Y Yukawa structures, taking the observed 650 GeV
resonance to be a CP-even Higgs state. An extensive parameter scan is
performed, incorporating the latest constraints. Our results show that a heavy
CP-even Higgs resonance around 650 GeV, produced predominantly via gluon-gluon
fusion and subsequently decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs boson together with
another scalar at approximately 95 GeV, can be simultaneously accommodated
within both the N2HDM Type-II and Type-Y frameworks at a significance level of
2$\sigma$. This interpretation leads to distinctive and testable predictions
from the N2HDM for the ongoing LHC Run-3 and the forthcoming High-Luminosity
LHC (HL-LHC) phase.

### [43] [A graphical representation of gluonic operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19696)
*Qingjun Jin,Ke Ren,Gang Yang,Rui Yu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a graphical method to systematically construct primitive gluonic operators in SMEFT, deriving those of length 2-7 in D-dimensions to address challenges from increasing operator complexity and experimental precision demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional gluonic operators are increasingly important in SMEFT due to improving LHC precision, but their rapid proliferation with dimension makes complete identification difficult. Previous work started with generating these operators using primitives, and this paper advances that by providing a visual and systematic construction method.

Method: Introduces a graphical representation of gluonic operators and a systematic construction method based on this visual approach to derive primitive operators up to length 7 in D-dimensions.

Result: Successfully derived all primitive gluonic operators from length 2 to 7 using the proposed graphical method, addressing the problem of combinatorial complexity in operator enumeration.

Conclusion: The graphical framework enables manageable and systematic construction of SMEFT operators, supporting precise theoretical predictions needed for high-precision collider experiments.

Abstract: Composite local operators are central to effective field theories (EFTs), as
they define interaction vertices in effective Lagrangians and play a
fundamental role in investigating the structure of quantum field theories. The
contribution of high-dimensional operators in the Standard Model Effective
Field Theory (SMEFT) grows increasingly important as experimental precision
improves at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in future colliders. However,
the number of operators increases very rapidly with dimension, making it
extremely challenging to identify their complete set. In our previous work
\cite{Jin:2020pwh}, we proposed a systematic method for generating gluonic
operators using primitive operators. In this paper, we introduce a graphical
representation of gluonic operators and, based on this representation, present
a method to systematically construct primitive operators. Using this method, we
derive primitive operators corresponding to gluonic operators of length 2 to
length 7 in $D$-dimensions.

### [44] [Beyond quasinormal modes: a complete mode decomposition of black hole perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18956)
*Paolo Arnaudo,Javier Carballo,Benjamin Withers*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that retarded Green's functions in black hole spacetimes can be represented as convergent mode sums across all spacetime regions. At late times, quasinormal mode sums converge, while Matsubara mode sums dominate early times, separated by a lightcone scattering from the black hole potential. Analytical proofs and numerical validations are provided for various spacetime models including Pöschl-Teller, BTZ, and Schwarzschild, with special focus on the Schwarzschild case using de Sitter quasinormal modes and Heun equation solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive framework for expressing retarded Green's functions in black hole spacetimes as convergent mode sums, resolving ambiguities in time-domain expansions and connecting different physical regimes (early vs. late times) through analytic methods.

Method: The authors decompose Green's functions into quasinormal and Matsubara mode sums, analyze their convergence regions separated by a lightcone, and apply residue asymptotics and numerical methods. For Schwarzschild, they use de Sitter quasinormal modes in the Λ→0 limit and exact Heun equation solutions to handle branch cuts.

Result: Convergent mode sum expressions for retarded Green's functions are established across all spacetime regions. Both analytical proofs (via residue asymptotics) and numerical evidence confirm convergence for tested spacetimes. In Schwarzschild, branch cuts are resolved using de Sitter modes, showcasing the method's robustness.

Conclusion: The convergence framework unifies time-domain Green's function analysis in black hole spacetimes, bridging early/Matsubara and late/quasinormal regimes. This method provides a reliable tool for future gravitational and quantum field theories studies in curved spacetimes.

Abstract: We show that retarded Green's functions of black hole spacetimes can be
expressed as a convergent mode sum everywhere in spacetime. At late times a
quasinormal mode sum converges, while at early times a Matsubara (or,
Euclidean) mode sum converges. The two regions are separated by a lightcone
which scatters from the black hole potential. The Matsubara sum is a Fourier
series on the Euclidean thermal circle associated to the early time region. We
illustrate our results for P\"oschl-Teller, BTZ, and Schwarzschild. In the case
of Schwarzschild, we express the branch cut contribution as a convergent sum of
de Sitter quasinormal modes as $\Lambda\to 0^+$, and exploit recent exact
solutions to the Heun connection problem. In each case we analytically show
convergence by studying the asymptotics of residue sums and also provide
numerical demonstrations.

### [45] [Magnetic field geometry in rotating wormhole spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19013)
*Milos Ertola Urtubey,Daniela Pérez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the Blandford-Znajek mechanism in a rotating wormhole spacetime, finding that the resulting Poynting flux is weaker compared to the Kerr black hole case, with differences growing as spacetime geometries diverge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the Blandford-Znajek mechanism beyond black holes and investigate energy extraction processes in rotating wormhole spacetimes, exploring differences caused by spacetime geometry.

Method: Solved the stream equation analytically for a Kerr-type wormhole spacetime to derive magnetic field expressions and calculated the associated Poynting flux.

Result: The electromagnetic Poynting flux from the wormhole is weaker than in Kerr black holes, with disparities increasing as geometrical differences between the spacetimes become more significant.

Conclusion: Rotating wormholes exhibit distinct electromagnetic energy extraction characteristics compared to black holes under the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, highlighting the impact of spacetime geometry on such processes.

Abstract: If a black hole is immersed in a magnetosphere,its rotational energy can be
transferred to the electromagnetic field and escape as a Poynting flux to
infinity. This process of extraction of rotational energy is known as the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism. It relies on the presence of both a magnetosphere
and an ergosphere surrounding the black hole. Previously, we showed that
rotating wormholes are also capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process
of accreting magnetized matter. In this work, we re-examine the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism in the case of a Kerr-type wormhole. For the first
time, we solve the stream equation in a rotating wormhole spacetime and derive
analytical expressions for the magnetic field. We then compute the associated
Poynting flux. Our results indicate that the electromagnetic flux in the
wormhole spacetime is weaker than in the Kerr case, and this difference becomes
more pronounced as the geometries of the two spacetimes increasingly deviate.

Abstract: We present a complete pipeline for detecting and characterising gravitational
waves (GWs) produced by the inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes in data
from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The analysis framework
relies on an efficient time-frequency implementation of an adaptive
semi-coherent detection statistic, which we show to be robust against
non-stationary noise and the presence of gaps of varying duration and cadence.
The search is able to detect signals down to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio
$\approx$ 11 over the full parameter space of black holes with spins aligned to
the orbital angular momentum and orbital eccentricity $\leq$ 0.01 when deployed
on the 2-year-long LISA Data Challenge Yorsh. The search can be run within a
day using $\approx$ 40 GPUs. The techniques presented here have wider
applications in GW astronomy, in particular the search for extreme-mass-ratio
inspirals in LISA data.

*William J. Smith,Krystal Ruiz-Rocha,Kelly Holley-Bockelmann,Michela Mapelli,Karan Jani*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. By comparing mock catalogs from different formation scenarios with gravitational-wave detector data (e.g., Cosmic Explorer), the approach can differentiate between stellar, AGN, and primordial origins out to high redshifts, linking gravitational-wave populations with cosmic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unresolved astrophysical origins of binary black hole mergers detected via gravitational waves necessitate a new approach to differentiate formation channels. Current methods lack the ability to distinguish between isolated binary stellar evolution, AGN disk binaries, and primordial black holes in dark matter halos.

Method: Using the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, the authors traced merger distributions over cosmic time and compared their clustering with the underlying matter distributions of the three formation channels. Mock catalogs for next-generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer were analyzed to assess feasibility.

Result: At low redshifts (z ≤ 0.5), distinct clustering signatures between formation channels become apparent. Future detectors could distinguish these pathways up to z ~5 within a decade, enabling cross-correlation studies between gravitational-wave catalogs and cosmic matter fields.

Conclusion: This method provides a novel framework for constraining black hole formation histories using gravitational-wave cosmology. By treating mergers as cosmological tracers, it offers a complementary tool to traditional population studies, enhancing understanding of binary black hole formation across cosmic time.

Abstract: The growing number of binary black hole mergers detected through
gravitational waves offers unprecedented insight into their underlying
population, yet their astrophysical formation channels remain unresolved. We
present a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using
their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across
cosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated
with three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries
embedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For
mergers at redshift $z \lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering
signatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current
ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Using mock catalogs for next-
generation facilities such as Cosmic Explorer, we find that their sensitivities
would enable differentiation of these formation pathways out to redshift $z
\sim 5$ within the first decade of observations. This approach provides a new
framework to link gravitational-wave populations with the large-scale structure
of the Universe. By treating black hole mergers as cosmological tracers, our
results demonstrate how cross- correlations between gravitational-wave catalogs
and the cosmic matter field can constrain the relative contribution of stellar,
AGN, and primordial channels, offering a complementary probe to population-
inference studies. These findings underscore the emerging potential of
gravitational-wave cosmology to reveal where and how black holes form and merge
across cosmic history.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: By employing Duan's topological method, we classify critical points by their
topological charge Q = +/-1 or 0. Previous work (Wei et al., Phys. Rev. D 105,
104003, 2022) investigated two typical anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes: the
Reissner-Nordstroem (RN) case (with only one critical point Q = -1) and the
Born-Infeld (BI) case (with two critical points Q = +/-1). In this work, we
first find that all three types of critical points appear in quantum anomalous
black holes for 4D spacetime. We then compute the quasinormal modes of massless
scalar perturbations near these critical points and find that both the
oscillation frequency and damping rate increase with the black hole radius at
the critical temperature. Besides such common behavior, although the Q = +1 and
Q = 0 cases do not show a discernible pattern due to the limited number of
samples, the Q = -1 case exhibits very similar dynamical characteristics across
all three black hole solutions, implying a nontrivial connection between
topological thermodynamics and dynamics.

Abstract: We construct a family of closeness functions on the space of finite volume

underlying random causal sets. Although strictly weaker than a Lorentzian
Gromov-Hausdorff distance function, it has the advantage of being numerically
calculable for large causal sets. It thus provides a concrete and quantitative
measure of continuumlike behaviour in causal set theory and can be used to
define a weak convergence condition for Lorentzian geometries.

*Rohan Srikanth,Tim Dietrich,Katy Clough*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores how light dark matter, modeled as a scalar field, affects binary neutron star mergers. It finds that while the scalar field forms a bound cloud around the binary, its effects on gravitational waves and ejecta are minimal under astrophysically motivated densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity environments using binary neutron star mergers, specifically investigating the role of dark matter in such systems.

Method: The authors simulate the dynamics of a minimally coupled scalar field (light dark matter) around a binary neutron star system during inspiral and merger, analyzing its binding and observational impacts.

Result: The scalar field forms a persistent cloud around the binary but only causes measurable effects (e.g., orbital dephasing, reduced remnant compactness, less dynamical ejecta) at high densities. Astrophysically relevant densities result in undetectable effects with current gravitational-wave technology.

Conclusion: While the framework allows testing dark matter interactions in extreme gravity, current observational constraints limit detectability of these effects under typical astrophysical conditions.

Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers provide a laboratory for probing fundamental
physics through their gravitational- wave emission and electromagnetic
counterparts. In particular, they may allow us to explore signatures of physics
beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity regimes, such as those of dark
matter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled
as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system.
Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the
binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential
impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the
scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At
sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a
dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and
suppression of the dynamical ejecta. For densities motivated by astrophysical
considerations, however, these effects remain small and are unlikely to be
detectable with current or next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.

TL;DR: Analysis of the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model shows it doesn't significantly alter structure growth beyond ΛCDM, failing to alleviate the $σ_8$ tension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the viability of $f(R)$ gravity modifications to ΛCDM by examining their impact on matter density perturbations and metric potentials, particularly addressing the $σ_8$ tension between early and late宇宙观测.

Method: Derivation and analysis of full scale-dependent equations for metric perturbations in general $f(R)$ theories, focused on the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki model. Compared results with quasistatic approximation and tested against late-time structure growth data.

Result: Constraints $|f_{R0}| ≤ 10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ from growth data. Found no significant phenomenological differences from ΛCDM at both background and perturbative levels. Model either worsens or replicates existing $σ_8$ tension.

Conclusion: Hu-Sawicki model doesn't resolve cosmological tensions. Proposed perturbative method can assess other $f(R)$ models for non-quasistatic effects.

Abstract: We provide insight about the full form of the equations for matter density
perturbations and the scalar Bardeen metric potentials in general $f(R)$
theories of gravity. When considering viable modifications to the standard
$\Lambda$CDM background, the full scale-dependent equations for the metric
perturbations are provided and are shown to match the ones obtained with the
quasistatic approximation. We investigate the impact of the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki
model on the late-time growth of structures. We find that updated late-time
growth of structure data imposes $|f_{R_0}|\lesssim10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ and thus
conclude that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model contributes no significant
phenomenology at both background and perturbative level beyond the effective
cosmological constant encompassed in its definition. This conclusion points to
the survival of the present tension between early and late measurements of
$\sigma_8$, as the Hu-Sawicki model can only worsen this issue or at best
reproduce the results from the current concordance cosmological model. The
generalized perturbative method showcased in this work can be applied to more
elaborate $f(R)$ models to isolate genuine higher-order signatures beyond the
quasistatic approximation.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormhole in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, showing distinct multi-photon ring structures and reduced shadow size compared to black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish wormholes from black holes using high-resolution imaging by studying unique observational features like multi-ring structures and shadow size reduction.

Method: Simulating the optical appearance of asymmetric wormholes with one or two accretion disks using Palatini $f(R)$ gravity and junction conditions, analyzing photon paths through the throat.

Result: Two-disk configurations produce more numerous and brighter photon rings than single-disk cases, with a significantly smaller central shadow, distinguishing wormholes from black holes.

Conclusion: High-resolution imaging can serve as a 'smoking gun' to identify ultra-compact non-black hole objects via their distinct multi-photon ring patterns and shadow characteristics.

Abstract: We consider the observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a
reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormhole. This wormhole, built in
the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity coupled to a Maxwell field using a
junction conditions formalism, lacks horizons but features photon spheres on
each side of the throat, described by different effective potentials and at
different locations. This fact allows a portion of the light rays arriving to
the observer's screen on one side of the throat to have explored a part of the
space-time on the other side, bringing information about the geometry gathered
there. In this setting we simulate the optical appearance of such an asymmetric
wormhole when illuminated by thin accretion disks, investigating scenarios with
either one or two (on each side of the throat) disks, revealing a rich
multi-photon ring structure due to light crossing the throat, and a strong
reduction in the size of the central brightness depression region. These new
rings are more numerous and far more luminous in the two-disk case than in the
single-disk case, and the shadow's size reduction far more acute, making a neat
distinction as compared to canonical black hole images. These results highlight
the potential of high-resolution imaging in providing smoking guns for the
existence of ultra-compact objects distinct from black holes via their
multi-ring structure.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study uses numerical relativity simulations to analyze dynamical captures of equal-mass non-spinning black holes, focusing on gravitational wave emissions, merger properties, and angular dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore strong-field gravity and identify parameters distinguishing scattering from capture events through analyzing momentum and angular dependencies.

Method: Numerical relativity simulations across initial linear momentum (p/M=0.095-0.75) and incidence angles (6.36°–2.83°), measuring Ψ₄, pre- and post-merger BH spins/masses.

Result: Gravitational wave emissions modeled with a simple analytical fit; merger delay from capture shows first-order divergence tied to critical angle; emission parameters linked to angle via linear/decay functions or complex behaviors.

Conclusion: Parameters like emission timing and waveform characteristics depend predictably on incidence angles, enabling distinction between scattering and capture events, and offer deeper insights into strong-field dynamics.

Abstract: Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an
exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational
physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study
the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We
consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta
($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and
study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and
masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple
analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We
study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger
emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized
by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates
a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the
parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or
exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others
display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of
these events.

### [54] [Nonlinear Stability of Rotating Hairy Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19825)
*Juan A. Carretero,Philippe Grandclément,Carlos Palenzuela,Marcelo Salgado*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines the stability of rotating hairy black holes (RHBHs) by simulating different configurations. It finds that RHBHs with a small scalar-field torus mass relative to the black hole remain stable, while those with a dominant scalar mass develop instabilities similar to boson stars. This implies RHBHs formed via superradiant growth are likely stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the stability of RHBHs, which are potential astrophysical objects formed by superradiant growth of light bosonic fields, as their stability properties are crucial for understanding their observational signatures and longevity.

Method: Non-linear numerical evolutions of RHBH configurations with varying scalar-field to black hole mass ratios. The study specifically examines how the relative mass distribution affects system stability.

Result: Stable behavior observed in configurations where scalar-field mass is subdominant. Instabilities (non-axisymmetric) emerge when scalar-field mass dominates, akin to boson star instabilities. This aligns with superradiance mass limits, indicating natural RHBHs via superradiance are stable.

Conclusion: RHBHs formed primarily through superradiant processes should be stable, as their scalar fields likely don't exceed the mass limits shown to cause instability. This has implications for astrophysical detection and modeling of such objects.

Abstract: Rotating hairy black holes (RHBHs) are axisymmetric equilibrium solutions of
the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, consisting of a spinning black hole
surrounded by a toroidal distribution of complex scalar field. Despite their
potential astrophysical relevance, the stability of these configurations
-naturally expected to form through superradiant growth of light bosonic
fields- remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the stability of RHBHs
by performing fully non-linear numerical evolutions of several configurations
that differ in the relative mass contribution of the scalar-field torus. We
find that configurations in which the scalar field mass is subdominant compared
to the black hole mass remain stable throughout the evolution. In contrast,
when the scalar-field mass dominates, the system develops an instability akin
to the non-axisymmetric instability observed in rotating boson stars. Given the
expected limits on the scalar-field mass growth achievable through
superradiance, our results suggest that rotating hairy black holes formed
predominantly by this process are expected to be stable.
