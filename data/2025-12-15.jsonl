Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this work, we analyze some matter sources associated with wormhole models within a k-essence theory coupled to the gravitational sector through a phantom scalar field. We adopt a spherically symmetric background in (3+1) dimensions and consider two types of systems: electrically and magnetically charged. In the first case, we consider the generalized Ellis-Bronnikov model, in which we fix the k-essence field exponent to $n=1/2$ and take the parameter $m\\ge 2$, where $m$ is the parameter that modifies the area of this wormhole model. From this we obtained the expression for the scalar field, the potential, and the associated electromagnetic functions for any values of the parameter $m\\geq{2}$. In the second and third models, we consider the scenario of two wormholes that are structured according to the adjustment of the parameters that define their area function $Σ^2$, and in both cases we adopt $n=1/2$. Finally, we show that the violation of the null energy conditions is conditioned by the parameters of the area function."}

In this work we model dark matter as an ultralight bosonic field, which can accrete onto the neutron star and form a composite object bound through gravity. Using long-term, numerical relativity simulations in spherical symmetry, we extract and analyze the frequency spectra of the radial oscillation modes of fermion-boson stars. Our simulations reveal that the fermionic and bosonic components synchronize through gravitational coupling, enriching their oscillation spectrum. This synchronization leads to new multi-state scalar configurations and reshapes the hierarchy of the neutron-star radial modes. We further propose a procedure to compute the values of the new dominant modes as a function of the bosonic mass, and discuss the implications for neutron-star physics and gravitational-wave astronomy."}

These gradients, which we refer to as axion hair, couple to the local background magnetic field, inducing a large voltage drop near the surface of the star; here, we demonstrate that the presence of axion hair decouples local near-field particle acceleration in the open magnetic field line bundle from the rotational frequency of the pulsar itself. This is significant as the non-observation of old slowly-rotating pulsars is attributed to the fact the rotationally-induced electric fields are not strong enough to sustain $e^\\pm$ pair production. In this work, we review the evidence for the existence for `pulsar death', i.e. the threshold at which $e^\\pm$ pair production (and thus, by association, coherent radio emission) ceases, and demonstrate using both semi-analytics and particle-in-cell simulations that the existence of axion hair can dramatically extend pulsar lifetimes. We show that the non-observation of extremely old, slowly rotating, pulsars allows for a new probe of light QCD and CP-violating axions. We also demonstrate how the observation of emission from both poles of pulsars with nearly orthogonal rotational and magnetic axes, as seen e.g. in PSR J1906+0746, can be used to set competitive limits on CP-violating axion-nucleon interactions."}

The impact of nuclear burning and atomic opacity is poorly understood and often treated with simplified prescriptions. We systematically investigate different treatments of nuclear heating, thermalization, and opacities in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of BNSM ejecta and kilonova light curves. Ejecta from long-term numerical-relativity simulations are evolved to ~30 days using a 2D ray-by-ray approach. We compare simplified heating-rates, thermalization prescriptions, and gray opacities with in-situ nuclear networks (NN) that track energy deposition, and include a composition-dependent thermalization scheme and frequency-dependent, atomic-physics-based opacities. Coupling NN and hydrodynamics affects nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. Assuming homologous expansion alters the abundance evolution and produces a narrower second $r$-process peak and a third peak shifted to higher mass numbers. Nuclear heating back-reaction delays and reddens the early emission. A constant thermalization underestimates the early luminosity and overestimates the late emission. Analytical opacities yield dimmer and redder kilonovae at early times ($t\\lesssim$ hour) and a prolonged emission at $t\\gtrsim5$ days. Resolving the first hundreds of milliseconds of hydrodynamics is essential for robust nucleosynthesis calculations, and composition-dependent thermalization and frequency-dependent, atomic opacities are needed to accurately capture the ejecta temperature and kilonova brightness and color evolution. Analytic nuclear-power fits with simplified thermalization and opacities can reproduce the density and temperature evolution of the ejecta. [Abridged]."}

We may group these by increasing complexity as follows. First, smooth variations in brightness across the surface, resembling solar limb darkening but much more prominent and involving more processes in stars with fast spin or external tides. Next, there are periodic features: not only oscillations, but also convective cells and starspots, which appear to transit across a star as its spins, and exoplanets that really do transit across the star. Then, there are transients like flares.\n  Current optical interferometers provide synthetic apertures of a few hundred metres and angular resolutions down to about nanoradian ($\\simeq 0.2\\,$milliarcsecond), enough to resolve some of the above features on the nearest upper main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants. Ongoing projects aims to km-scale synthetic apertures, enough to measure the radius of the nearest white dwarf.

In the first-order formalism for gravitational theories, where torsion and gauge freedom are present, it has been suggested that the first law of black hole thermodynamics requires a specific gauge choice, which would undermine its fundamental character.

The present work introduces an alternative method that establishes this independence in a more direct manner, thereby reinforcing the status of the first law as a guide toward quantum gravity. This method also facilitates explicit computations of the first law and helps resolve several ambiguities that commonly appear in such analyses."}

These solutions have little in common besides the use of a trigger operator. We argue that focusing on the signatures of the three already-known trigger operators can lead to discover or exclude this class of solutions to the hierarchy problem."}

Observations of M69 led to the discovery of two MSPs: J1831$-$3220A (M69A) and J1831$-$3220B (M69B), both of which we localize with arcsecond precision using interferometric imaging. Observations of M70 resulted in three new MSPs: J1843$-$3217A (M70A), J1843$-$3217B (M70B), and J1843$-$3217C (M70C). Although direct imaging did not yield precise localizations for these MSPs, we provide initial estimates based on uGMRT beam forming and imaging analysis.

We describe libyt's architecture for parallel computing in high-performance computing environments, including its bidirectional connection between simulation codes and Python, and its integration into the Jupyter ecosystem. We detail its methods for reading AMR simulations and handling in-memory data with minimal overhead, and procedures for yielding data when requested by Python. We describe how libyt maps simulation data to yt frontends, allowing post-processing scripts to be converted into in situ analysis with just two lines of change. We document libyt's API and demonstrate its integration into two astrophysical simulation codes, GAMER and Enzo, using examples including core-collapse supernovae, isolated dwarf galaxies, fuzzy dark matter, the Sod shock tube test, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the AGORA galaxy simulation. Finally, we discuss libyt's performance, limitations related to data redistribution, extensibility, architecture, and comparisons with traditional post-processing approaches."}

Our findings indicate that when test particles possess magnetic moments, applying an external magnetic field of appropriate strength can induce resonant precession of the angular momentum direction under the influence of gravitational waves. This resonance may significantly amplify the gravitational wave signal, potentially enabling its detection with future gyroscope-based detectors.

With these occultations, VERITAS can directly measure the smallest angular diameters of any instrument or technique in the optical for stars between magnitude 9 and 13. Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation.

A softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry plays a crucial role in realizing this scenario, under which the Standard Model (SM) fermions are even, while new vector-like fermions present in the model are odd. A notable feature of this model is that the PS gauge boson $X_μ$ itself is $Z_2$-odd, causing it to couple exclusively between SM fermions and the vector-like fermions, except in the right-handed down-quark sector, where mixing is induced by the soft breaking of $Z_2$. This structure leads to helicity suppression of tree-level meson decays mediated by $X_μ$, with helicity-unsuppressed contributions arising only via one-loop diagrams. We show that $X_μ$ can be as light as 1.1 TeV while being compatible with all flavor-violating constraints. However, mass relations among the $(W'^\\pm_μ, Z'_μ, X_μ)$ gauge bosons push the $X_μ$ mass limit up to 4.3 TeV from the stringent LHC bounds on the $Z^\\prime$ mass. This comparatively low PS-breaking scale opens up promising collider opportunities for probing the leptoquark gauge boson, as well as the distinctive signature of vector-like down-type quarks carrying an unusual baryon number of $2/3$. The model can be further tested via lepton flavor-violating processes induced by the leptoquark gauge boson, such as $μ\\to e γ$, $μ\\to e e e$, and $μ$-$e$ conversion in nuclei. Neutrino masses arise in the model through dimension-seven operators at tree-level, as well as from dimension-five operators via one-loop diagrams."}

There are two kinds of process invoking neutron stars as an origin of FRBs, namely inner-driven starquakes and outer-driven collisions with interstellar objects (ISOs). The former origin should exhibit an earthquake-like statistical behavior while the latter should show a stochastic process. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical method by making use of the energy structure function of active repeating FRBs and earthquakes. We find that the energy structure function of FRBs exhibits a very different statistical behavior compared to that of earthquakes. On small time-interval scales, the energy of an earthquake show a tendency to decay with time-interval and the energy difference of a pair of events increases with time-interval. Such a behavior is not found in FRBs, whose energy function is very similar to those of a stochastic process. Our result shows that repeating FRBs may have an origin process differing from that of earthquakes, i.e., FRBs arise from a series of unrelated events such as collisions of a neutron star with ISOs."}

Robust and scalable bibliographies ensure that we can measure the scientific impact of our facilities and archives.

We therefore present the Automated Mission Classifier (amc), a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to identify and categorize telescope references by processing large quantities of paper text. A modified version of amc performs well on the TRACS Kaggle challenge, achieving a macro $F_1$ score of 0.84 on the held-out test set. amc is valuable for other telescopes beyond TRACS; we developed the initial software for identifying papers that featured scientific results by NASA missions. Additionally, we investigate how amc can also be used to interrogate historical datasets and surface potential label errors. Our work demonstrates that LLM-based applications offer powerful and scalable assistance for library sciences."}

One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordström metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordström spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime. While the Reissner-Nordström embedding presented has several similarities to the Fronsdal embedding of the Schwarzschild metric, the presence of the second horizon requires additional embedding coordinates and terms not found in the Fronsdal embedding, in order that the embedding is defined and finite on each horizon."}

Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated.\n  Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects.

In hydrogen rich progenitors, the reverse shock arising at the hydrogen-helium interface has the potential to dramatically enhance fallback, yet its overall impact across a broad explosion-energy range has not been systematically quantified. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for metal-poor progenitors with $M_{\\rm ZAMS}=18$-$28\\,M_\\odot$ and models with and without hydrogen envelopes, we explore fallback over explosion energies of $10^{48}$-$10^{52}\\,{\\rm erg}$. We find a robust and universal mass-transition behaviour: when the explosion energy reaches only $2$-$3$ times the binding energy of the hydrogen envelope, the reverse shock returns to the centre and sharply increases the remnant mass by $\\gtrsim 2\\,M_\\odot$. Above this threshold, the reverse shock escapes and hydrogen-rich and stripped-envelope progenitors yield nearly identical remnant masses. By normalizing the results with the envelope binding energy, we show that all progenitor models converge to a common fallback relation. We further provide a simple analytic prescription that connects explosion energy, hydrogen-envelope binding energy, and final compact-remnant mass. This relation provides an important link between progenitor properties and compact-remnant masses, and is useful for population-synthesis and galactic chemical-evolution studies."}

We explicitly show here that the genuine tripartite entanglement measure, i.e., the tangle vanishes identically for all flavors signifying that three flavor neutrino system form a W-type entangled state. Further, we investigate alternative measures of tripartite entanglement like the partial tangle and the concurrence fill which capture the total sharing of entanglement beyond pairwise correlations. In terms of bipartite and bi-partitioned entanglement measures, we derive the symmetric invariant and the concurrence fill, which quantify the distributed entanglement completely expressible in terms of flavor transition probabilities. These entanglement measures display distinct energy dependent patterns across the oscillation window which can be experimentally accessible in the long baseline experiments like DUNE providing an alternative quantum information perspective on flavor evolution. We use GLobal Long Baseline Experiment Simulator (\\textsf{GLoBES}) simulations within the DUNE set up to investigate these tripartite entanglement measures in terms of neutrino energy and the length of the baseline. It is observed that, at the point of maximal mixing, these measures show near maximal entanglement between the muon and the tau flavor modes establishing entanglement monogamy. Within the DUNE set up, the wide band of energy and expected higher sensitivity to CP-violation at second oscillation maximum provide a unique advantage to explore the quantum correlation effects across a broader energy window."}

As indicated in our cross-sectional analysis, at 9.16 TeV with a coupling parameter kappa = 0.5, the production probability reaches its peak.

For the comparison, the study also performs calculations for proton-proton and electron-proton colliders to highlight the muon-proton collider's effectiveness in probing vector-like quarks.

The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field.

Depending on the interaction type, the resulting cosmological dynamics can either feature a late-time attractor corresponding to a dynamical dark energy phase, often with characteristic phantom behavior, including in models inspired by simplicial gravity, or instead support an early slow-roll inflationary epoch driven by the same underlying quantum-gravitational effects. This emergent inflation, effectively captured by a single-field description, can sustain the required expansion, naturally avoids the graceful exit problem, and appears to transition into a persistent, non-accelerating phase consistent with classical expectations."}

Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \\approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events. They demonstrate little apparent evolution in the SN properties from local examples despite EP240801a originating from an epoch 10 Gyr ago."}

We investigate its production in heavy-ion collisions under the hypothesis that it is a compact tetraquark. To this end, we derive a coalescence model from the Lindblad equation, assuming that unbound heavy quarks are thermalized within the quark-gluon plasma and that the adiabatic approximation holds. Using this model, we predict the nuclear modification factor of the X(3872) at LHC energies, with proton-proton baseline cross sections estimated from available experimental data. We also consider the effect of simplifying assumptions on the model, and a complementary approach based on chemical equilibration. Our results indicate that recombination is the dominant production mechanism for a tetraquark X(3872). It leads to a significant yield enhancement in heavy-ion collisions, suggesting that the nuclear modification factor is a powerful observable for probing the exotic nature of this state"}

These gradients, which we refer to as axion hair, couple to the local background magnetic field, inducing a large voltage drop near the surface of the star; here, we demonstrate that the presence of axion hair decouples local near-field particle acceleration in the open magnetic field line bundle from the rotational frequency of the pulsar itself. This is significant as the non-observation of old slowly-rotating pulsars is attributed to the fact the rotationally-induced electric fields are not strong enough to sustain $e^\\pm$ pair production. In this work, we review the evidence for the existence for `pulsar death', i.e. the threshold at which $e^\\pm$ pair production (and thus, by association, coherent radio emission) ceases, and demonstrate using both semi-analytics and particle-in-cell simulations that the existence of axion hair can dramatically extend pulsar lifetimes. We show that the non-observation of extremely old, slowly rotating, pulsars allows for a new probe of light QCD and CP-violating axions. We also demonstrate how the observation of emission from both poles of pulsars with nearly orthogonal rotational and magnetic axes, as seen e.g. in PSR J1906+0746, can be used to set competitive limits on CP-violating axion-nucleon interactions."}

We find that, for this basis, the self-energy contributions can be identified from their diagrammatic topologies, as in full QCD.

Since 2018, VERITAS has implemented a program to detect predicted asteroid occultations, where an asteroid covers up a star.

With these occultations, VERITAS can directly measure the smallest angular diameters of any instrument or technique in the optical for stars between magnitude 9 and 13. Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation. Once a planned FADC upgrade is complete, VERITAS will begin a program to search for serendipitous occultations within its full field of view (3 deg). Serendipitous occultations of sub-km trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have the potential to constrain models of solar system formation. This work details how VERITAS predicts and observes occultations as well as the overall status of the asteroid occultation program and future steps for observing occultations of both asteroids and TNOs."}

In inclusive dijet topologies at s^(1/2) = 8 and 13 TeV, with realistic jet selections, we compare a BFKL-based Monte Carlo (BFKLex) to two general-purpose event generators based on collinear factorization and DGLAP parton showers, PYTHIA8 (pT-ordered) and HERWIG7 (angular-ordered). Even when two underlying dynamics happen to give similar inclusive jet rapidity distributions, such observables are too coarse to discriminate their underlying rapidity point processes, whereas the rank-ordered distributions remain sensitive to the differences in how rapidity space is filled. For fixed multiplicity (N=3) and for the second-most-forward/backward jets across multiplicities, BFKLex populates the rapidity interval more democratically, whereas the general-purpose event generators exhibit comparatively stronger edge enhancement for N=3 and narrower, more centrally concentrated distributions for the second-most ranks. These shape differences are stable under variations of jet radius, proton PDFs, and MPI/hadronization settings, and persist when requiring large rapidity separation between the outer jets. Rank-ordered rapidities thus compress genuinely exclusive information about the multi-jet final state into one-dimensional, normalized histograms that are directly measurable with existing dijet and Mueller-Navelet selections and provide a new handle on high-energy radiation patterns."}

At leading order in the QCD coupling, the di-jet cross-section exhibits transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorisation, with a gluon diffractive TMD distribution (DTMD) which is controlled by gluon saturation and describes the transverse-momentum imbalance between the produced jets. The next-to-leading corrections generate the various quantum evolutions of the diffractive gluon distribution. We focus on the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolution which describes the change in the gluon DTMD when increasing the ''hard scale'' (the typical transverse momentum of the di-jets). We consider two different representations for this equation, one in transverse-momentum space, the other one in transverse-coordinate space. They are not fully equivalent with each other (despite being related by a Fourier transform) because of the respective boundary conditions. These conditions encode the essential physics of gluon saturation together with the effects of two other types of quantum evolution: the BK/JIMWLK evolution over the rapidity gap (''inside the Pomeron'') and the DGLAP evolution outside the rapidity gap (''within the diffractive system''). We demonstrate that, due to gluon saturation, one can compute both the boundary conditions and the CSS solutions fully from first principles, without reference to non-perturbative physics. We numerically find a good agreement between the CSS solutions in the two aforementioned representations."}

In this extended HEFT, depending on the $SU(2)$ nature of the new scalar in the UV, operators will be suppressed by different powers of a heavy mass scale. We use dimensional analysis to systematically evaluate expected hierarchies between Wilson coefficients, leading to structural relations between potential LHC observables, such as di-boson resonances, tau pair production or the di-photon channel. Once future collider data reveals a hint of a new scalar field, it can be fitted to this extended HEFT and such a structural analysis will help interpret it with respect to possible UV models, circumventing the need to individually test each possible model on the data or to fix the $SU(2)$ representation of the new scalar beforehand. For illustration, the framework is applied to the tentative 95 GeV resonance. In addition to its usefulness for collider physics, the extended HEFT can also be beneficial for low-energy observables, allowing to describe new scalars in an agnostic way."}
