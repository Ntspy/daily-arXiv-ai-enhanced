In this work, we develop a general relativistic formalism to compute the local density, capture probability, and energy deposition of particles arriving as directed beams onto compact objects. The framework is based on the mapping of an asymptotic particle flux to local densities through geodesic congruences, allowing for gravitational focusing, multi-stream regions, and optical depth effects to be incorporated in a unified way. The formalism applies to arbitrary particle species and interaction models, and separates capture from through-going energy deposition in a frame-consistent manner. As an explicit application, we consider relativistic particle beams generated in astrophysical jets and evaluate their interaction with two compact objects samples: a white dwarf and a neutron star.

Yet, a considerable fraction of eFXTs still lack secure classifications due to the absence of timely follow-up observations. We carry out a systematic search of publicly available optical survey data and transient databases (including the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF, and the Transient Name Server, TNS) for optical counterparts to eFXT candidates detected by EP.

This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3.

The reduction of the uncertainties associated to these developments has brought previously neglected effects into focus as their typical magnitude are competitive with the size of the uncertainties. One such effect is the inclusion of QED into PDF fits. Typically this is a percent effect, and thus while theoretically important, it has had a relatively limited impact on phenomenological studies up to this point. In this proceeding we study some of the effects which, while peripheral to the inclusion of QED in the proton, can considerably change the relative size and shape of the QCD+QED fit with respect to the QCD only determination. These may become important in the future as precision continues to increase. After a comparison of the QCD+QED PDFs with the QCD only PDFs of various global PDF fitting groups, we focus largely upon NNPDF4.0, which shows the biggest effect when including QED. Focusing largely on a single set of PDFs also enables more subtle effects to be analysed, making it an ideal candidate for this study.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines the impact of including Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in proton structure function analyses, particularly focusing on the NNPDF4.0 parton distribution functions (PDFs), which show the most significant changes when QED is incorporated.
