The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $σ$, and take the limit $σ\\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $σ> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin."}

In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We then assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue. Our simplified model provides an overall good agreement with observational data; we have further found an average constraint on the scalar field particle's mass $m\\sim 10^{-27}$ eV, in agreement with similar galactic-scale soliton solutions."}

Post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (NR). Nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$."}

In this work, we explore post-merger detectability and inference through an alternative detector readout scheme for data dominated by quantum-noise, which is the case above $1$\\,kHz: photon-counting. In such a readout, signals and noise become quantized into discrete distributions corresponding to the detection of single photons measured in a chosen basis of modes. Through simulated data, we demonstrate that photon counting can be efficient even for weak signals.

Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\\,M_\\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events."}

Using three-loop renormalization group equations, we systematically investigate enhancement factors $k = λ_{\\rm enhanced}/λ_{\\rm SM}$ ranging from $k=1.0$ (Standard Model) to $k=7.2$ (radiative electroweak symmetry breaking prediction). We identify $k_{\\rm crit} = 1.03$ as the marginal case where the coupling transitions from negative to positive evolution at high energies. For $k > 1.03$, the theory exhibits absolute vacuum stability and develops UV poles at $Λ_{\\rm UV} \\sim 10^{16}$--$10^{18}$ GeV, signaling effective field theory breakdown and the onset of strong dynamics. The radiative symmetry breaking scenario with $k \\approx 7.2$ falls deep in this regime, naturally connecting the electroweak scale to compositeness or other strong-coupling physics near the GUT scale.

The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy."}

The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses."}

These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods -- on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy.

The background dynamics includes an attractor that funnels a wide range of initial conditions onto an evolution unique to each parameter space. In a large swath of parameter space beyond existing limits, the dark sector deviates drastically from cold dark matter in observable epochs. We rule out this parameter space using existing constraints on dark-sector equation of state and small-scale cosmic perturbations, thus setting the strongest constraints yet on dark matter self-interactions at length scales shorter than 100 kpc. In addition, we briefly discuss repulsive dark forces and place cosmological limits that are stricter than in the attractive case."}

In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs.

This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory."}

The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $ω= -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($ω= -1$) with a subdominant $ω= -5/3$ fluid (around $5\\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $ω= -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $Ω_{\\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG.

Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $Λ$CDM ($Δ\\text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model.

Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model. The hadro-leptonic interpretation of the two gamma-ray flares suggests that CGRaBS J0211+1051 could be both a potential neutrino emitter and TeV-bright (E>10 TeV). Thus, it may offer a unique test bed to check for hadro-leptonic contributions to the multi-messenger emission in blazar jets."}

This paper aims to incorporate machine-learning techniques with a Bayesian inference to improve the accuracy and efficiency of null depth retrieval in nulling interferometry. Specifically, it explores the use of neural posterior estimation (NPE) to develop models that overcome the computational limitations of conventional methods, such as numerical self-calibration (NSC), providing a more robust solution for accurate null depth calibration. An NPE-based model was developed, with a simulator that incorporates real data to better represent specific conditions. The model was tested on both synthetic and observational data from the LBTI nuller for evaluation. The NPE model successfully demonstrated improved efficiency, achieving results comparable to current methods in use. It achieved a null depth retrieval accuracy down to a few $10^{-4}$ on real observational data, matching the performance of conventional approaches while offering significant computational advantages, reducing the data retrieval time to one-quarter of the time required by self-calibration methods. The NPE model presents a practical and scalable solution for null depth calibration in nulling interferometry, offering substantial improvements in efficiency over existing methods with a better precision and application to other interferometric techniques."}

Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $>10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies.

The CMS search in this channel shows a $3.6σ$ excess over the QCD background for a dijet mass $M_{jj} \\approx 0.95$ TeV, which can be due to $Θ$: its production cross section (65 fb for a real scalar) and the acceptance of the CMS event selection applied to $p p \\to ΘΘ\\to \\!

Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions.

Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques -- the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models -- are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state."}

Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations capture the early inspiral dynamics analytically but break down near merger, while numerical relativity (NR) provides the accurate yet computationally expensive waveforms over limited parameter ranges. We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that learns corrections mapping PN dynamics and waveforms to their NR counterparts. As a demonstration of the approach, we use the TaylorT4 PN model as the baseline, and train the network on hybridized NR surrogate data (NRHybSur3dq8) to learn higher-order corrections to the orbital dynamics and waveform modes for nonspinning noneccentric systems. Physically motivated loss terms enforce known limits and symmetries, such as vanishing corrections in the Newtonian limit and suppression of odd-$m$ modes in equal-mass systems, promoting consistent and reliable extrapolation beyond the training region. We simultaneously incorporate corrections that account for the different meaning of mass parameters in PN and NR descriptions. The learned corrections significantly reduce the phase and amplitude error through the inspiral up to about $200M$ before the merger. This approach provides a differentiable and computationally efficient bridge between PN and NR, offering a path toward waveform models that generalize more robustly beyond existing NR datasets."}

Using $\\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$σ$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \\xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\\lesssim3$~$μ$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission. This conclusion does not exclude hadron acceleration in the V4641~Sgr system."}

This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories.

The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068.

We have discovered that improved positron polarization leads to a less strict requirement on the beam polarization precision for measurements that scale only with the effective polarization, $P_\\mathrm{eff}$. Conversely, measurements that scale with the product of beam polarizations, $P_-P_+$, such as those that contain the $eeZ$ or $eeγ$ vertex, have their polarization precision demands get more strict as positron polarization increases.

The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy."}

However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB.

We show that the dark sector dynamics, both at the background and perturbation levels, is far richer than what can be captured with just the static interparticle Yukawa potential. The background dynamics includes an attractor that funnels a wide range of initial conditions onto an evolution unique to each parameter space. In a large swath of parameter space beyond existing limits, the dark sector deviates drastically from cold dark matter in observable epochs. We rule out this parameter space using existing constraints on dark-sector equation of state and small-scale cosmic perturbations, thus setting the strongest constraints yet on dark matter self-interactions at length scales shorter than 100 kpc. In addition, we briefly discuss repulsive dark forces and place cosmological limits that are stricter than in the attractive case."}

As the temperature decreases and the field is released from its trapped configuration, inhomogeneities are exponentially amplified through an instability in their equation of motion, leading to the fragmentation of the axion field. We show that this process constitutes a novel source of gravitational waves (GWs), analogous to those generated in zero-temperature axion fragmentation, but with distinct characteristics. We quantify the resulting GW spectrum, identifying the peak frequency and amplitude associated with the inhomogeneous axion dynamics. Our results indicate that the GW signal can be enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard fragmentation scenario, while exhibiting a markedly different spectral shape. The parameter space featuring both strong GW signals and reproducing the correct dark matter abundance is, however, limited."}

This allows one to set bounds on the exotic Higgs branching ratio which, for specific $φ$ decay modes, can surpass those expected at the end of the High Luminosity LHC in the regime of large LLPs proper decay lengths. On the other hand, we find that the proposed strategy will not be able to further extend the limits that might be set by proposed LHC far detectors such as CODEX-b, ANUBIS and MATHUSLA."}

However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\\times10^{-11}\\rm g/cm^3$. Our work opens up an exciting new channel to investigate the very center of galaxies, where disk gas density distributions $ρ(r)$ can be recovered by analyzing time-dependent environmental imprints in gravitational waveforms."}

Under the outgoing wave condition, two resonance states of $K \\bar{K}^*$ are produced with different coupling constants fixed with the binding energies of $f_1(1285)$ and $f_1(1378)$, respectively. Both of the resonance states are located in the vicinity of 1400 MeV, and thus it is reasonable to assume that these two resonance states correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of the Particle Data Group simultaneously. This method is extended to study the $D \\bar{D}^*$ system analogously. When the particle $χ_{c1}(3872)$ is treated as a bound state of $D \\bar{D}^*$, the particles $T_{c\\bar{c}1}(3900)$, $T_{c \\bar{c}}(4020)$ and $X(3940)$ can be obtained as solutions of the Schrödinger equation under the outgoing wave condition, which implies the spin and parity of these particles are all $J^P=1^+$."}

The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations."}

The selection of true non-strange quark-antiquark excited states and assigning to them definite $L$ and $n$ is a notoriously confusing problem. Three guiding principles for selection of correct observed states are formulated. They are applied for construction of a new $(L,n)$-classification. This classification is consistent both with the approximate Regge form of the spectrum and with the hydrogen-like degeneracy, i.e., the dependence of mass on the sum $L+n$."}

In the framework, flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking effect is incorporated into the topological amplitudes, allowing the nonfactorizable contributions from topological diagrams to be expressed as a minimal set of universal parameters determined through a global fit to experimental data. Thanks to the sufficient data with high precision, we are now able to quantify the nonfactorizable contribution of so-called ``factorization\" $T$ diagram, which is essential for explaining the observed branching ratios. The parameters for the $C$, $E$, and $A$ diagrams are also updated with significant improved precision, and notably, the resulting strong phases differ substantially from those in the earlier FAT analysis. We find that the $C$ topological amplitude features substantial nonfactorizable effects in the charm sector. These refined parameters enable predictions of significantly improved accuracy, yielding branching ratios in good agreement with current data and the latest results in topological diagram approach, and the predicted direct $\\mathit{CP}$ asymmetries differ distinctly form previous FAT results due to updated strong phases. In several modes, the $\\mathit{CP}$ asymmetries are predicted to reach $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, thereby making them promising observables for future high-precision experiments at LHCb, BESIII and Belle II.

Long", "Bibhushan Shakya", "Julia Anabell Ziegler"], "title": "Bubble Friction in Symmetry-Restoring Transitions", "comment": "17 pages, 5 Figures", "summary": "In standard (symmetry-breaking) first-order phase transitions, the frictional pressure on expanding bubble walls can be dominated by transition radiation -- the emission of a gauge boson with phase-dependent masses as particles present in the thermal plasma pass through bubble walls. This process is enhanced in the soft limit, and is known to produce a significant frictional effect that is proportional to the Lorentz factor $γ$ of the bubble wall, thereby prohibiting runaway behavior. We calculate the analogous pressure for phase transitions with symmetry restoration. In such transitions, we show that the pressure due to this process can be $\\textit{negative}$, producing the opposite effect. However, when the Lorentz factor of the wall gets very large, the result approaches the same scaling as the standard scenarios. Therefore, phase transitions with symmetry restoration can feature an intermediate negative friction regime even in the presence of significant interactions with the plasma, and the bubble wall terminal Lorentz factor can be significantly larger (by more than an order of magnitude) than in the corresponding symmetry-breaking scenarios. This can carry important implications for various phenomenological applications, from gravitational waves to physics beyond-the-Standard-Model."}

While the PNGB of the $U(1)_F$ factor behaves as a standard QCD axion (an axiflavon) with suppressed flavor-violating couplings, the three degrees of freedom from $SU(2)_F$ have not been studied before. This work focuses on these states, considering both the case where $SU(2)_F$ is a global symmetry, yielding pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGBs), and the case where it is a gauge symmetry with a potentially small coupling, yielding a triplet of (possibly) light gauge bosons. In both scenarios, these new bosons naturally feature unsuppressed flavor-violating couplings to Standard Model fermions in the mass basis. We derive the resulting predictions for flavor-changing neutral currents and lepton flavor violation, including exotic decays of mesons and leptons. Our analysis shows that processes like $K \\to πX$ and $μ\\to e X$ place the most stringent constraints, probing the flavor symmetry breaking scale $v_φ$ up to $10^{11}-10^{12}$ GeV for light bosons, while heavier states are tested in $B$ and $τ$ decays, as well as by $K-\\bar K$ mixing and $μ\\to e γ$.

Verne2 code available at https://github.com/bradkav/verne/", "summary": "While Dark Matter (DM) is typically assumed to interact only very weakly with the particles of the Standard Model, many direct detection experiments are currently exploring regions of parameter space where DM can have a large scattering cross section. In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations."}

This mechanism leads to a framework where the QCD axion and dark monopoles account for the dark matter density, and the observed baryon asymmetry is generated through the rotating QCD axion via axiogenesis. The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field. The axion kinetic energy is dissipated by the transition, and thus the axion abundance is depleted to the observed dark matter abundance. We predict that the axion decay constant should be below $10^9$ GeV to explain the observed dark matter and baryon densities."}
