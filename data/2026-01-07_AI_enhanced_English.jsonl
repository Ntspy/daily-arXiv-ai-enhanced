For time series where the exposure time is comparable to the kernel timescale, the observed signal represents an exposure-averaged version of the true underlying signal.

In any case, objects embedded in the disk (e.g. compact objects, stars, gas, dust) can undergo gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions with each other leading to interesting processes such as binary interaction/capture, gravitational wave merger events, dynamical friction, accretion, gap opening, etc. It has long been argued that disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can enhance the rates for many of these events; however, almost all of that analysis has assumed specific thin-disk models (with aspect ratios $H/R \\lesssim 0.01$). We show here that the rates for processes such as these that are mediated by gravitational cross-sections has a very strong inverse dependence on the thickness $H/R$ (scaling as steeply as $(H/R)^{-8}$), and $H/R$ can vary in the outer disk (where these processes are often invoked) by factors $\\gtrsim 1000$ depending on the assumed source of pressure support in the disk. This predicts rates that can be lower by tens of orders-of-magnitude in some models, demonstrating that it is critical to account for disk parameters such as aspect ratio and different sources of disk pressure when computing any meaningful predictions for these rates. For instance, if magnetic pressure is important in the outer disk, as suggested in recent work, capture rates would be suppressed by factors $\\sim 10^{10}-10^{20}$ compared to previous studies where magnetic pressure was ignored.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study examines how disk thickness (H/R) profoundly affects interaction rates between embedded objects in AGN disks, with rates dropping by up to 10^20 times when considering magnetic pressure in thicker disks.", "motivation": "To reassess the validity of previous AGN disk interaction rate calculations that relied on thin-disk assumptions, as pressure sources and disk geometry may drastically alter outcomes.", "method": "Derives scaling laws showing inverse dependence of interaction rates on H/R, evaluates cross-dependency with pressure sources (thermal vs magnetic), and compares thin vs thick disk models.", "result": "Interaction rates scale steeply with (H/R)^-8, leading to suppression factors up to ~1e10-1e20 when magnetic pressure dominates in thicker outer disks, challenging prior thin-disk based estimates.", "conclusion": "AGN disk parameters like aspect ratio and pressure mechanisms must be carefully modeled to accurately predict interaction rates, as thick/magnetic-pressure dominated disks can negate prior assumptions."}}

For the filters where the background is generally dominated by airglow, the backgrounds measured from the data are significantly lower than what the ETC predicts (as of ETC v33.2).

We model mixing via a gradient-based mixing approximation that evolves simultaneously with the hydrodynamics. We find that mixing occurs in regions where the electron fraction changes rapidly. While mixing smooths composition gradients in transition regions, it has a negligible impact on the heavy-element yields. This is because the primary $r$-process site (the equatorial ejecta) is initially homogeneous in free neutrons, leaving no strong gradients for mixing to act upon. In each angular ray, the abundances of the most produced elements are robust under mixing, while the less abundant ones are more affected. The total global abundances change only slightly from mixing, since each angular ray contributes its most abundant elements. Furthermore, the predicted kilonova light curves show only minor reddening, with differences below the detectability of state-of-the-art telescopes.

The goal of this work is to search for a radio counterpart of the extended VHE source. We observed V4641 Sgr with the MeerKAT radio telescope at the L and UHF bands and produced deep maps of the field using high dynamic range techniques. We report the discovery of a large-scale (35 pc), bow-tie-shaped, diffuse, radio structure around V4641 Sgr, with similar angular size to the extended X-ray emission discovered by XRISM. However, it is not spatially coincident with the extended VHE emission. After discussing the association of the structure with V4641 Sgr, we investigate the nature of the emission mechanism.
