### [1] [When inflationary perturbations refuse to classicalise: the role of non-Gaussianity in Wigner negativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22219)
*Aurora Ireland,Vincent Vennin*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether inflationary perturbations retain quantum features despite being treated classically. Using the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of inflation, it shows that their Wigner function's negativity (indicating quantum interference) persists, especially in ultra-slow-roll scenarios, challenging the classicality assumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if primordial gravitational perturbations exhibit quantum birthmarks (non-Gaussianities) detected via Wigner function negativity, challenging the classical stochastic treatment in cosmology.

Method: Computed the Wigner function of curvature perturbations using the EFT of inflation, incorporating non-Gaussianities. Analyzed its non-positivity (negativity) on super-Hubble scales, especially in ultra-slow-roll conditions.

Result: Found pronounced interference fringes in the Wigner function on super-Hubble scales, with negativity growing as $a^2$ during ultra-slow-roll. This shows quantum effects persist late into evolution, contradicting expectations that squeezing induces classicality.

Conclusion: Quantum signatures (non-positive Wigner functions) from inflation can survive long enough to affect cosmological observables, suggesting potential detectability and revising assumptions about when classicality emerges.

Abstract: Inflationary perturbations are quantum in origin. Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought.

### [2] [Modified Teleparallel $f(T)$ Gravity, DESI BAO and the $H_0$ Tension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22225)
*Mariam Bouhmadi-López,Carlos G. Boiza,Maria Petronikolou,Emmanuel N. Saridakis*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how $f(T)$ gravity models affect the $H_0$ tension, finding that torsional modifications can partially alleviate or worsen the discrepancy depending on phantom/quintessence behavior, though not surpassing $\Lambda$CDM's statistical preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if late-time teleparallel gravity modifications (specifically $f(T)$ models) can resolve the $H_0$ tension between early and late-universe measurements. Previous studies highlight conflicting $H_0$ values, motivating exploration of beyond-GR scenarios.

Method: Three $f(T)$ parametrizations are tested against Pantheon+ SNe, DESI DR2 BAO, Planck CMB priors, and redshift-space distortions. These models reconstruct torsion effects only at late times while matching GR at early epochs.

Result: Two models moderately increase $H_0$ toward local values (phantom regimes), one exacerbates the discrepancy (quintessence behavior). Combined data mildly disfavor $f(T)$ over $\Lambda$CDM, but show tension redistribution between cosmic expansion and structure growth.

Conclusion: Late-time teleparallel modifications don't statistically outperform $\Lambda$CDM, but demonstrate non-trivial interactions between background expansion/growth dynamics that could redistribute observational tensions in multi-parameter cosmologies.

Abstract: We investigate whether late-time modifications of gravity in the teleparallel framework can impact the current tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, focusing on $f(T)$ cosmology as a minimal and well-controlled extension of General Relativity. We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $Λ$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors.

### [3] [Scattering sections from regular black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22299)
*Omar Pedraza,L. A. López,Isaac Fernández*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how black holes surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) have altered scattering cross sections, both classically and semi-classically. Results indicate that PFDM increases classical cross sections and modifies interference fringe widths, with similar trends observed via partial wave methods. These findings highlight the potential significant role of dark matter in black hole phenomenology, especially near the event horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of PFDM on black hole scattering cross sections, addressing gaps in understanding dark matter's role in black hole physics and potential observational effects in astrophysical scenarios.

Method: Calculation of classical and semi-classical scattering cross sections considering PFDM parameters using two approaches (direct computation and partial wave method) to validate results.

Result: Presence of PFDM increases classical scattering cross sections, alters semi-classical interference fringe widths, and partial wave method confirms similar qualitative behavior.

Conclusion: Dark matter surrounding black holes significantly affects scattering processes, emphasizing the necessity to consider dark matter in black hole phenomenological models, particularly in proximity to the event horizon.

Abstract: In this contribution, we investigate the scattering cross sections of black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We present both the classical and semi-classical scattering cross sections for different values of the parameter that characterizes the PFDM contribution. Our results show that the presence of dark matter increases the classical scattering cross section and modifies the width of the interference fringes in the semi-classical regime. In addition, the scattering cross section is also computed using the partial wave method for the black holes considered, exhibiting similar qualitative behavior. These findings suggest that the effects of dark matter surrounding black holes may play an important role in black holes phenomenology, particularly in certain regions near the black hole.

### [4] [Photon-graviton polarization entanglement induced by a classical electromagnetic wave](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22332)
*Alessandro Ferreri*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates photon-graviton pair production in a classical EM wave in Minkowski spacetime, finding entangled (Bell states) photon-graviton pairs and discusses observation possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how classical EM waves can induce particle production involving gravitons, and to study potential entanglement generation in such scenarios.

Method: Model using quantized graviton field and classical EM wave (linear/circularly polarized) plus quantum fluctuation field, analyzing quantum state evolution.

Result: Photon-graviton Bell states formed in polarization basis; possible detection in artificial/natural environments.

Conclusion: The interaction between classical EM fields and quantized gravity can generate entangled photon-graviton pairs, suggesting avenues for experimental verification.

Abstract: We study the photon-graviton pair production induced by the propagation of a classical electromagnetic (EM) wave in a Minkowskian spacetime. In our model, the gravitational field is described in terms of the quantized graviton field, whereas the electromagnetic field is split into a classical drive (a linearly or circularly polarized electromagnetic wave) and a quantum fluctuation field. We analyze the time evolution of the quantum state showing that, among other outcomes, the propagation of the EM wave can generate Bell states in the photon-graviton polarization basis. We finally discuss the possibility to observe entangled photons in artificial and natural scenarios.

### [5] [Revisiting the energy-momentum squared gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22333)
*Mihai Marciu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper revisits energy-momentum squared gravity theory by incorporating second derivatives of the matter Lagrangian with respect to the metric, grounded in thermodynamics. It shows compatibility with cosmic expansion, explaining matter domination and late-time acceleration via linear stability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how thermodynamical considerations and higher-order derivatives of the matter Lagrangian affect gravitational theories' cosmological viability, particularly addressing the compatibility of energy-momentum squared gravity with observed universe expansion phases.

Method: Derive scalar-tensor representation of energy-momentum squared gravity with corrected terms from thermodynamics. Apply linear stability theory to analyze cosmological implications, testing different matter Lagrangians' effects on cosmic evolution.

Result: The theory successfully explains matter-dominated era transition and approaches de Sitter-like accelerated expansion, showing viability for current cosmological observations without instabilities under specific matter conditions.

Conclusion: Energy-momentum squared gravity, when extended with thermodynamic corrections, provides a consistent framework for describing cosmic evolution from matter domination to late-time acceleration, offering a promising alternative to standard models.

Abstract: In this paper we have revisited the energy-momentum squared gravity theory, by taking into account the second derivative of the matter Lagrangian with respect to the metric, encapsulating relations originated from thermodynamical grounds. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the energy-momentum squared gravity with the new corrections, we have analyzed the physical implications by relying on the linear stability theory. The results show that the current cosmological system is compatible with the expansion of the Universe for some specific matter Lagrangians, explaining the emergence of matter domination era, approaching the late time accelerated expansion era close to the de-Sitter phenomenology.

### [6] [Grey-body factors of higher dimensional regular black holes in quasi-topological theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22340)
*Juan Pablo Arbelaez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how grey-body factors and Hawking radiation are impacted in higher-dimensional regular black holes within quasi-topological gravity, finding significant suppression compared to General Relativity's singular black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how removing the central singularity via quasi-topological gravity affects Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation without losing the event horizon or semiclassical description.

Method: Analyzing grey-body factors and Hawking radiation of higher-dimensional regular black holes in quasi-topological gravity, comparing their radiation transmission and evaporation rates to singular black holes in General Relativity.

Result: Found that all regular black hole models studied show significantly suppressed radiation transmission and Hawking evaporation compared to General Relativity's singular solutions.

Conclusion: The removal of singularities via quasi-topological gravity leads to notable reductions in Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation rates, suggesting new insights into quantum gravity effects in regular spacetimes.

Abstract: We study grey-body factors and Hawking radiation of higher-dimensional regular black holes arising in quasi-topological gravity. These spacetimes incorporate infinite-curvature corrections that remove the central singularity while preserving an event horizon and a well-defined semiclassical description. We show that, for all considered regular black hole models, the transmission of radiation and the corresponding Hawking evaporation are significantly suppressed compared to the singular black hole solutions of General Relativity.

### [7] [A Maximum Entropy Conjecture for Black Hole Mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22388)
*Monica Rincon-Ramirez,Nathan K. Johnson-McDaniel,Eugenio Bianchi,Ish Gupta,Vaishak Prasad,B. S. Sathyaprakash*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes an entropy maximization conjecture suggesting that the final state of binary black hole mergers may be governed by thermodynamic principles, as entropy peaks near the numerically predicted remnant parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether a simple thermodynamic principle, specifically entropy maximization, underlies the selection of the final remnant in binary black hole mergers, as numerical relativity alone provides precise predictions without explaining the underlying principle.

Method: Using post-Newtonian relations and numerical relativity data, the authors mapped the binary's mass and angular momentum to those of a Kerr black hole, observing that entropy peaks at values close to the final remnant's parameters.

Result: Entropy reaches a maximum during the binary's evolution, coinciding closely (within ~3%) with the mass and spin of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity, suggesting a thermodynamic selection principle.

Conclusion: The observed maximum entropy alignment with the merger outcome supports a conjecture that thermodynamic principles, particularly entropy maximization, may govern the final state of binary black hole mergers.

Abstract: The final state of a binary black hole merger is predicted with high precision by numerical relativity, but could there be a simple thermodynamic principle within general relativity that governs the selection of the remnant? Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state.

### [8] [Thermodynamics and Stability of Ultraspinning Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22565)
*Zhenbo Di*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that ultraspinning black holes can have thermodynamically stable regions, challenging previous assumptions. The stability depends on dimension, solution branch, and charge presence. The revised reverse isoperimetric inequality is applied, setting new constraints on parameters like μ, m, q, and l.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on ultraspinning black holes focused on neutral cases and high-temperature regimes, concluding their instability. This work aims to revisit their stability using heat capacity analysis across all horizon radii and verify the applicability of the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality.

Method: The authors systematically analyze the heat capacity in various ensembles across the full range of horizon radii, apply the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality, and use the Iyer-Wald formalism to derive conserved charges and confirm the first law's validity.

Result: Thermodynamically stable regions exist in ultraspinning black holes, influenced by spacetime dimension, solution branch, and charge. The revised inequality imposes constraints: upper μ bound, lower m bound, and upper limits on q and l.

Conclusion: Ultraspinning black holes exhibit stable regions under specific conditions, overturning earlier instability claims. The revised inequality effectively constrains their parameters, enhancing understanding of their thermodynamics.

Abstract: Ultraspinning black holes have attracted considerable attention due to their super-entropic nature, and previous analyses -- mostly restricted to neutral cases and high-temperature regimes -- have suggested that such black holes are always thermodynamically unstable. In this work, we revisit the thermodynamic stability of ultraspinning black holes by performing a systematic analysis of the heat capacity in different ensembles over the full range of the horizon radius $r_H$, which were missed in earlier temperature-based analyses. We demonstrate for the first time that, contrary to earlier claims, ultraspinning black holes can admit thermodynamically stable regions, whose existence crucially depends on the spacetime dimension, the solution branch, and the presence of charge. In addition, we present the first application of the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality to ultraspinning black holes. Despite the violation of the original reverse isoperimetric inequality in this super-entropic regime, we find that the revised inequality remains applicable and imposes nontrivial constraints on the allowed parameter space, including an upper bound on the ultraspinning parameter $μ$, strengthened lower bounds on the mass $m$, and upper bounds on both the charge $q$ and the AdS radius $l$. To ensure the consistency of the thermodynamic description, the conserved charges and the first law in the ultraspinning limit are derived using the Iyer-Wald formalism together with integrability conditions.

### [9] [Holographic Dark Energy as a Source for Wormholes in Modified Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22577)
*G. G. L. Nashed,A. Eid*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines traversable wormhole solutions in f(R,T) gravity using holographic dark energy densities from different entropy formalisms. It derives shape functions meeting throat and flare-out conditions, analyzes parameter effects on force balance and energy conditions, and finds null energy condition violation requiring exotic matter support, with solutions visualized via embedding surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore wormhole solutions in modified gravity theories (f(R,T) gravity) using specific holographic dark energy models, investigate parameter impacts on physical conditions, and understand the requirement for exotic matter in sustaining traversable wormholes.

Method: Prescribes holographic dark energy densities based on Rényi, Moradpour, and Bekenstein-Hawking entropies; solves f(R,T) field equations to obtain shape functions; analyzes parameter α/β effects on equilibrium forces and energy conditions; visualizes geometry through embedding diagrams.

Result: Derived shape functions satisfy throat/flare-out conditions; varying α/β influences force balance and energy condition violations; null energy condition violated necessitating exotic matter; embedding diagrams confirm valid spatial structures.

Conclusion: f(R,T) gravity permits traversable wormholes with specific holographic dark energy models, but exotic matter is essential. Parameter variations offer tunable properties for wormhole geometries, expanding possibilities in modified gravity scenarios.

Abstract: Traversable wormhole solutions are explored in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathbb{T})$ gravity, a curvature--matter extension in which $\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar and $\mathbb{T}$ denotes the trace of the energy--momentum tensor. To generate explicit wormhole models, we prescribe holographic dark-energy densities based on entropy formalism proposed by Rényi, Moradpour, and Bekenstein--Hawking, namely \[ ρ_{\textit{R}} = \fracα{4α_1 r^4 c^2 κ}\ln\!\left(1+πα_1 r^2\right), \qquad ρ_{\textit{M}} = \fracα{4πr^2 c^2 κ\left(πα_1 r^2 + 1\right)}, \qquad ρ_{\textit{BH}} = \fracα{4 c^2 κr^2}, \] with $α$ and $β$ carrying dimensions of $L^{-2}$. The corresponding shape functions obtained from the field equations satisfy the standard throat and flare-out requirements for traversability. We then study how varying $α$ and $β$ affects (i) the balance of forces associated with equilibrium and (ii) the status of the energy conditions. In particular, the null energy condition is found to be violated, indicating that exotic matter (or an effective exotic sector) is required to support the wormhole geometry. The spatial structure of the solutions is further visualized through embedding surfaces.

### [10] [Nonlocal Corrections to Scalar Field Effective Action in de Sitter spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22644)
*Will Cerne,Teruaki Suyama*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the one-loop effective action for a scalar field in an FLRW spacetime, incorporating quantum corrections via the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. It identifies nonlocal memory and noise terms, renormalizes divergences, and applies a local approximation showing reduced field variance in the IR for a φ⁴ theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand quantum corrections beyond tree-level in cosmological settings, particularly addressing nonlocal effects and their impact on scalar field dynamics in expanding universes.

Method: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, the authors derived equations of motion incorporating nonlocal terms (memory and noise) up to second order in interactions. They performed renormalization of UV divergences and applied a local approximation for slowly-varying fields.

Result: Identified ultraviolet divergences in nonlocal terms, established a renormalization procedure, and demonstrated that nonlocal memory terms suppress infrared field variance in the φ⁴ model compared to tree-level predictions.

Conclusion: Nonlocal quantum effects significantly influence scalar field dynamics in FLRW backgrounds, altering infrared behavior and necessitating beyond-local treatments for accurate cosmological predictions.

Abstract: We investigate the one-loop effective action for a test scalar field in a general Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, specifically focusing on quantum corrections up to the second order in the interaction strength. By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we derive the equation of motion for the field expectation value, which incorporates not only the standard local radiative corrections but also novel nonlocal features: a memory term and a stochastic noise term. We identify all ultraviolet divergent structures within these nonlocal terms and provide a consistent renormalization procedure. To analyze the physical impact of these terms, we apply a local approximation under the assumption of slowly-varying fields, by which the memory term acts as a negative contribution to the drift coefficient. As a concrete application, we consider a massive $φ^4$ theory and show that these one-loop corrections lead to a suppression of the field variance in the infrared regime compared to the tree-level results.

### [11] [Geometric Selection Rules for Singularity Formation in Modified Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22739)
*Soumya Chakrabarti*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The polynomial degeneracies of curvature invariants in modified gravity theories can act as geometric selection rules, restricting singularity formation to specific algebraic branches rather than being a generic outcome.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the algebraic structure of Riemannian geometry influences the occurrence of spacetime singularities in modified theories of gravity, such as f(R) gravity and scalar-tensor theories.

Method: Derivation of constraints imposed by curvature invariants on the effective energy-momentum tensor in metric f(R) gravity and scalar-tensor theories. Analysis of how these degeneracies lead to anisotropies that occlude singularity formation.

Result: Singularity formation in these theories is not generic but restricted to algebraically admissible branches determined by curvature invariants. The degeneracies cause curvature or scalar-induced anisotropies that hide singularities.

Conclusion: Geometric selection rules from curvature invariants play a critical role in modulating singularity formation in modified gravity, indicating that not all paths lead to singularities as in general relativity.

Abstract: We argue that the polynomial degeneracies of curvature invariants can act as geometric selection rules for spacetime singularities in modified theories of gravity. The degeneracies arise purely from the algebraic structure of Riemannian geometry and impose non-trivial constraints on the effective energy-momentum tensor. We derive these constraints for metric $f(R)$ gravity and a wide class of scalar-tensor theories to show that a singularity formation is generally occluded by curvature and/or scalar-induced anisotropies. Therefore, formation of a singularity in modified theories of gravity is not always a generic outcome but can occur only along algebraically admissible branches selected by Riemannian curvature invariants.

### [12] [Cosmological Dynamics of Hyperbolic Evolution Models in $f(Q,L_m)$ Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22780)
*V. A. Kshirsagar,S. A. Kadam,Vishwajeet S. Goswami*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines sine and cosine hyperbolic models in $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity, showing they produce viable cosmological behavior mimicking ΛCDM with quintessence phases and accelerating expansion consistent with energy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore cosmologically viable models in $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity that can explain the transition from early deceleration to late-time cosmic acceleration without violating fundamental energy conditions.

Method: Testing sine and cosine hyperbolic evolution functions in $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ framework, analyzing equation of state parameter behavior, energy conditions validation, and deceleration parameter profiles.

Result: Models exhibit quintessence-like EoS approaching -1, aligned with ΛCDM at late times. Strong energy condition violation confirms accelerated expansion, supported by deceleration parameter analysis showing valid evolution phases.

Conclusion: The proposed models are viable as they satisfy energy conditions, explain cosmic acceleration, and reproduce the observed expansion history from deceleration to acceleration phases.

Abstract: This paper highlights cosmologically viable sine and cosine hyperbolic evolution functions in the framework of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity. The models have been tested to check the behavior of the equation of state (EoS) parameter under the variation of parametric values. The EoS parameter experiences a quintessence phase, and is approaching to $-1$ at late time. The models are showing inclined behaviour with the $Λ$CDM model at the late time. The viability of both the models is retested using the widely accepted energy conditions in both cases. The violation of the strong energy condition admits the accelerating behaviour of the models. The same has been explained through the analysis of the profile of deceleration parameter, which concretely supports the evidence that the models explain early deceleration to late time acceleration phenomena.

### [13] [Scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory is tested by black hole photon rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23012)
*Qiao Yue*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines photon ring and shadow properties of Reissner-Nordström black holes in scalar-tensor-vector gravity, analyzing effects of parameters α and Q. Results show distinct behaviors in black hole structure quantities and observational signatures, offering tests for modified gravity and quantum gravity models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how parameters α (MOG parameter) and charge Q influence the photon ring and shadow structure of Reissner-Nordström black holes, providing observational criteria to test modified gravity theories and distinguish quantum gravity models using EHT data.

Method: The authors used analytical calculations to study the event horizon, photon sphere, and ISCO radii. Ray-tracing simulations were performed to visualize lensing structures, and radiative simulations assessed photon ring characteristics under varying α and Q parameters. EHT data constraints on SgrA* and M87* were applied to bound α and Q values.

Result: Key findings include inverse relations between Q and photon ring parameters (r_h, r_ph, b_ph), while α positively correlates with these. Allowed parameter ranges for α (0-0.06, 0-0.11, 0.19-0.36) for Q=0, 0.5, 1 respectively. Photon ring non-degeneracy and widened b interval with higher Q were observed.

Conclusion: The work establishes a computational framework linking scalar-tensor-vector gravity parameters to observable photon ring features, enabling tests of modified black hole models and quantum gravity predictions. Future ngEHT polarization observations can further validate these results and refine parameter constraints.

Abstract: This paper investigates the photon ring and shadow structure of the Reissner-Nordström black hole in the scalar-tensor-vector gravitational framework. The black hole is characterized by the ( MOG) parameter (α) and the charge (Q). The study finds that as (α) increases, the event horizon radius (r_h), photon sphere radius (r_{ph}), and critical impact parameter (b_{ph}) all increase, while these decrease as (Q) increases. The innermost stable circular orbit radius (r_{isco}) exhibits similar monotonic behavior. Ray-tracing shows that as (Q) increases, the impact parameter (b) interval between the lensing ring and photon ring widens; (b_{\text{ph}}) is non-degenerate, and the photon ring radius is uniquely determined by (α) and (Q). Using $EHT$ constraints on (SgrA^*) and (M87^*), the bounds on (α) and (Q) are derived. For (Q = 0), (0.5), and (1), the allowed ranges are (α\in [0, 0.06]), ([0, 0.11]), and ([0.19, 0.36]), respectively. Radiative simulations show that for fixed (Q), larger (α) leads to a larger, non-degenerate photon ring. The Schwarzschild case is approached only when both (α) and (Q) are small. This provides a computational basis for testing modified black holes and offers a non-degenerate observational criterion for distinguishing quantum gravity models, consistent with current $EHT$ data. Future observations with $ngEHT$ and multi-band polarization can further test this. The results suggest that studying the photon ring structure of a Reissner-Nordström black hole in scalar-tensor-vector gravity provides a unique optical diagnostic for potential quantum-gravity tests and black hole properties.

### [14] [Towards Claiming a Detection of Gravitational Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23019)
*Jann Zosso,Lorena Magaña Zertuche,Silvia Gasparotto,Adrien Cogez,Henri Inchauspé,Milo Jacobs*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting gravitational memory by proposing a theoretical framework for modeling its time-dependent signal in space-based detectors like LISA, focusing on supermassive black hole mergers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the difficulty in distinguishing gravitational memory's time-dependent signal from regular gravitational waves, enabling robust detection claims through statistically sound methods.

Method: The method includes a review of gravitational memory theory, a framework for modeling memory rises in compact binary coalescences, and analysis of LISA's response to memory contributions from supermassive black hole mergers.

Result: The framework allows hypothesis testing between memory-free and memory-inclusive signals and quantifies detection prospects, providing a foundation for future observational claims.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a principled pathway for detecting gravitational memory, advancing observational cosmology by enabling definitive claims in future space-based experiments like LISA.

Abstract: Gravitational memory is a zero-frequency effect associated with a permanent change in the asymptotic spacetime metric induced by radiation. While its universal manifestation is a net change of proper distances, gravitational-wave detectors are intrinsically insensitive to the final offset and can only probe the associated transition. A central challenge for any claim of detection therefore lies in defining a physically meaningful and operationally robust model of this time-dependent signal, which is uniquely attributable to gravitational memory and distinguishable from purely oscillatory radiation. In this work, we propose a general solution to this challenge. Building on a self-contained review of the theory of gravitational memory, we discuss a theoretical framework for defining and modeling a gravitational memory rise, in particular applicable to compact binary coalescences. Specializing to space-based detectors, we analyze the response of LISA to gravitational radiation including a memory contribution, with particular emphasis on mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which offer the most promising prospects for a first single-event detection. The framework developed here provides the theoretical foundation for statistically well-defined hypothesis testing between memory-free and memory-full radiation and quantitative assessments of detection prospects. As such, these results establish a principled pathway toward a future observational claim of gravitational memory.

### [15] [Causal spinfoam vertex for 4d Lorentzian quantum gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23162)
*Eugenio Bianchi,Chaosong Chen,Mauricio Gamonal*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new causal spinfoam vertex for 4d Lorentzian quantum gravity, using Toller T-matrices to encode causal data. It demonstrates cancellation of Toller poles in the EPRL vertex, connects to the Livine-Oriti model via the Barrett-Crane limit, distinguishes spinfoam causal data from Regge data, and shows that in the large-spin limit only compatible Lorentzian Regge geometries with causal rigidity are selected, yielding a single exponential form.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the understanding of causal structures in quantum gravity by formulating a Lorentzian spinfoam model that properly incorporates causality, resolves ambiguities in existing models, and verifies consistency with Regge calculus in the classical limit.

Method: Develops a new spinfoam vertex using Toller T-matrices combined with Wigner D-matrices. Analyzes pole cancellations in the EPRL vertex, applies the Barrett-Crane limit to derive the Livine-Oriti model, compares spinfoam and Regge causal data, and performs a large-spin asymptotic analysis.

Result: Shows that Toller poles cancel in EPRL vertex computations. Establishes the emergence of Livine-Oriti model from Barrett-Crane limit. Confirms that only causally compatible Regge geometries contribute in the large-j limit with a single exponential amplitude and novel causal rigidity property.

Conclusion: The new causal spinfoam vertex successfully integrates Toller matrices for Lorentzian quantum gravity, resolves ambiguities in prior models, and ensures geometric and causal consistency with Regge calculus in classical regimes, advancing causal dynamics in spinfoam approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a new causal spinfoam vertex for $4$d Lorentzian quantum gravity. The causal data are encoded in Toller $T$-matrices, which add to Wigner $D$-matrices $T^{(+)}+T^{(-)}=D$, and for which we provide a Feynman $\mathrm{i}\varepsilon$ representation. We discuss how the Toller poles cancel in the EPRL vertex, how the Livine-Oriti model is obtained in the Barrett-Crane limit, and how spinfoam causal data are distinct from Regge causal data. In the large-spin limit, we show that only Lorentzian Regge geometries with causal data compatible with the spinfoam data are selected, resulting in a single exponential $\exp(+\mathrm{i}\, S_{\mathrm{Regge}}/\hbar)$ and a new form of causal rigidity.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates LISA's capability to detect the displacement memory effect from massive black hole binary mergers using Bayesian analysis and simulations, enabling tests of General Relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The displacement memory effect, a permanent spacetime deformation from gravitational waves, offers a new way to test GR and alternative theories. LISA's sensitivity makes it an ideal tool for detecting this effect, which is currently undetectable by ground-based observatories.

Method: The authors use LISA simulations, Bayesian analysis for detectability assessment, parameter estimation to evaluate displacement memory's impact, and apply the method to MBHB population models to estimate detection rates over LISA's mission lifetime.

Result: LISA can detect displacement memory from sufficiently loud MBHB mergers, achieving subpercentage-level amplitude precision. They predict observable event rates based on different astrophysical models.

Conclusion: LISA will provide a new observational avenue for GR tests via displacement memory detection, with results constraining alternative theories and requiring ~100+ MBHB detections for confident amplitude measurement.

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy opens a new venue to explore the universe. Future observatories such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are expected to observe previously undetectable fundamental physics effects in signals predicted by General Relativity (GR).One particularly interesting such signal is associated to the displacement memory effect, which corresponds to a permanent deformation of spacetime due to the passage of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore the ability of LISA to observe and characterize this effect. In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories. To provide astrophysical context, we apply our analysis to black hole binary populations models and estimate the rates at which the displacement memory effect could be observed within the LISA planned lifetime.

*Bogdan A. Rudenko,Maria A. Skugoreva,Alexey V. Toporensky*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the effectiveness of slow-roll approximations in Gauss-Bonnet inflation with growing coupling functions, finding they do not improve precision compared to [1], and in some cases perform worse than standard approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how the choice of growing versus decaying coupling functions affects the accuracy of slow-roll approximations in Gauss-Bonnet inflation models, contrasting prior results from [1].

Method: Analytical and numerical analysis comparing new slow-roll approximations with standard ones for Gauss-BonGBonnet inflation models using growing coupling functions.

Result: New approximations do not enhance precision for growing coupling functions, unlike in [1]; certain scenarios show worse performance than standard approximations.

Conclusion: Growing coupling functions diminish the superiority of new slow-roll approximations, suggesting their validity depends critically on coupling function behavior.

Abstract: In our paper we consider the validity of slow-roll approximations for Gauss-Bonnet inflation introduced in [1]. In contrast to the cited paper where the coupling function before the Gauss-Bonnet term have been chosen as a decaying function of the scalar field, here we consider growing coupling functions. We have found that while in [1] new slow-roll approximations work considerably better, now they do not increase the precision. Moreover, we identify some cases where more involved approximations work worse than the standard one. Corresponding explanations of such a situation are given.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper discusses the on-sky performance of an RT-MLI filter made of Styroace-II styrofoam, which effectively reduces ambient IR radiation entering a sub-100 mK bolometric detector. It achieves over 90% IR rejection with <12 W transmitted power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient thermal radiation rejection system for cryogenic bolometric detectors, ensuring minimal thermal loading while maintaining mm-wave transmission for astronomical observations.

Method: Testing the RT-MLI filter's performance with a 0.42 m aperture and dilution-refrigerator-cooled detectors, measuring transmitted IR power and analyzing filter design/placement effects.

Result: The filter rejected over 90% of expected IR radiation, transmitted <12 W power, and maintained >95% transmission in detector passbands, confirming its effectiveness in reducing thermal background.

Conclusion: The RT-MLI filter successfully meets thermal and transmission requirements for cryogenic detector systems, providing a viable solution for mitigating ambient IR contamination in low-temperature astronomical instruments.

Abstract: We present the on-sky performance of a Radio-Transparent Multi-Layer Insulation filter (RT-MLI) that uses Styroace-II styrofoam to reject ambient thermal radiation from entering a 0.42 m diameter aperture to a sub-100 mK bolometric detector array cooled by a dilution-refrigerator. We find that greater than 90% of the expected incident infra-red (IR) radiation is rejected, resulting in $<$12 W of measured transmitted power. Transmitted power in the detector passbands is consistent with a lower bound of 95%. We address filter design and placement, thermal loading, and mm-wave transmission.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel solar instrument using the HEP DLP801RE DMD for dynamic field-of-view control, demonstrating high optical efficiency, structural improvements, and successful exoplanet transit simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable real-time targeted spectroscopy of magnetically active solar regions and full-disk observations while advancing high-precision solar and exoplanetary science.

Method: The method involves using the HEP DMD to reconfigure the spatial light modulation, conducting simulations and laser tests for optical efficiency validation, and performing structural analysis after destructive testing. Artificial planetary transit simulations were also carried out.

Result: Results include a 250:1 contrast ratio (limited by evaluation board duty cycle), confirmed removal of central vias in the DMD structure, and successful recovery of exoplanet transit depths from gas giants down to 40 ppm rocky planets.

Conclusion: The HEP DMD shows significant potential for future applications in both solar and exoplanetary research due to its dynamic capabilities and improved optical performance.

Abstract: We present the motivation and early tests for a novel solar instrument that will harness the new High Efficiency Pixel (HEP) Texas Instruments DLP801RE Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) as a reconfigurable spatial light modulator. This design enables real-time, dynamic configuration of the field of view for targeted spectroscopy of magnetically active regions and full-disk observations. Optical efficiency was validated through simulations and laser testing. Destructive window removal allowed for detailed structural analysis, confirming the elimination of central vias present in previous models. We measured a contrast ratio of 250:1, currently limited by the evaluation board's duty cycle rather than the DMD itself. Furthermore, we successfully simulated artificial planetary transits, recovering depths ranging from gas giants to a 40 ppm rocky planet transit. These results demonstrate the HEP DMD's potential for high-precision solar and exoplanetary science applications.

*Shuhong Liu,Xining Ge,Ziying Gu,Lin Gu,Ziteng Cui,Xuangeng Chu,Jun Liu,Dong Li,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper presents a physics-based noise synthesis framework for astronomical imaging that models various noise sources in CCDs, enabling the creation of large paired datasets for supervised learning. It also introduces a real-world dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Astronomical images are noise-limited, and existing calibration pipelines don't sufficiently address stochastic noise. Lack of paired training data and physically interpretable models hinder learning-based denoising.

Method: The framework models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and outliers from cosmic rays/hot pixels. Low-noise inputs are created by averaging unregistered exposures. A new real-world dataset with raw, calibrated frames, and high-SNR bases is provided.

Result: The synthesized data allows training of supervised models with abundant paired datasets, improving denoising while maintaining physical interpretability. The real dataset enables rigorous real-world evaluation.

Conclusion: Physics-based noise synthesis addresses data scarcity and improves scientific workflow compatibility, advancing learning-based astronomical image denoising.

Abstract: Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing constraints, while standard calibration pipelines mainly remove structured artifacts and leave stochastic noise largely unresolved. Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. We further introduce a real-world dataset across multi-bands acquired with two twin ground-based telescopes, providing paired raw frames and instrument-pipeline calibrated frames, together with calibration data and stacked high-SNR bases for real-world evaluation.

### [21] [Subsolar mass black holes from stellar collapse induced by primordial black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22220)
*Thomas W. Baumgarte,Stuart L. Shapiro*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores an 'indirect PBH scenario' where subsolar mass black holes (observed as M_obs) could form via a primordial black hole (PBH) of much smaller mass (M_P BH) capturing and consuming a dwarf star (M_* ≈ M_obs), offering an alternative origin to direct PBH formation and potentially explaining rare subsolar mass detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate alternative origins for subsolar mass black holes if detected, challenging the assumption that such masses directly imply primordial black holes of the same mass (direct scenario).

Method: The authors propose and analyze an 'indirect PBH scenario' involving PBH capture and consumption of dwarf stars, providing rough estimates on feasibility and population implications in environments like dwarf galaxies.

Result: The scenario could produce significant subsolar mass black hole populations in dwarf galaxies and may explain rare detections previously attributed to direct PBH formation.

Conclusion: Subsolar mass black hole observations might not exclusively indicate primordial origins matching their observed mass, suggesting indirect formation pathways require consideration in future analyses.

Abstract: While no gravitational-wave detection of subsolar mass black holes has been confirmed to date, a number of candidate detections invite us to speculate on the origin of such black holes should a detection be confirmed. It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a ``direct PBH scenario". Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\rm PBH} \ll M_{\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \simeq M_{\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an ``indirect PBH scenario" may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events.

### [22] [Observational Implications of Cosmic Ray-Inverse Compton 'Boosted' Cool Cores in Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22229)
*Philip F. Hopkins,Emily Silich,Jack Sayers,Sam B. Ponnada,Isabel Sands*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes that cosmic ray (CR) inverse-Compton (IC) emission in cool-core galaxy clusters could mimic thermal X-ray emission, offering an alternative explanation for the cooling flow problem. This challenges traditional assumptions by suggesting CR-IC contributes significantly to observed X-ray emission, affecting interpretations of cluster properties and observed correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the long-standing cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters, where observed X-ray emission suggests rapid cooling, yet no sufficient cooling masses are detected. The paper seeks to explore whether CR-IC emission could provide an alternative mechanism to explain the observed thermal-like X-ray spectra without requiring actual rapid cooling.

Method: The authors analyze the observable consequences of CR-IC emission in cool-core clusters. They model how long-lived (Gyr-old) 0.1-1 GeV cosmic rays, propagating up to ~100 kpc, generate IC radiation scattering CMB photons. This emission is shown to reproduce key observational features like density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates typically attributed to cool cores. The study also examines implications for correlations between AGN activity, radio structures, and X-ray properties, as well as effects on cluster pressure estimates and abundance measurements.

Result: Key results include the prediction that CR-IC emission can generate X-ray spectra resembling thermal emission, potentially explaining observed properties of cool-core clusters without requiring rapid cooling. The model naturally accounts for correlations between AGN activity and X-ray/radio properties, and predicts observable effects like reduced SZ/X-ray pressure ratios and suppressed X-ray-derived metal abundances. These predictions align with existing observations in high-resolution data.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that CR-IC emission provides a compelling alternative explanation for the cooling flow problem, reconciling observed X-ray emission with the lack of sufficient cooling masses. This framework offers a unified interpretation of various cluster phenomena, including AGN/jet properties, radio structures, and apparent correlations, while introducing testable predictions for upcoming observations of surface brightness evolution at high redshifts.

Abstract: X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $γ$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\rm radio}-L_{\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\rm cav}-L_{\rm X,cool}-L_{\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$.

### [23] [X-Ray Analysis of an Off-Axis Merger Stage Binary Galaxy Cluster: PSZ2 G279.79+39.09](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22251)
*Sibel Döner,Turgay Caglar,Krista L. Smith,Serap Ak,Andrea Botteon,M. Kiyami Erdim,John A. ZuHone*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study analyzes the merging galaxy cluster system PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 using X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Chandra. It identifies two subclusters with similar masses and disturbed structures, including ram-pressure stripping evidence and a shock wave, suggesting a recent off-axis merger close to core passage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamics and thermodynamics of a galaxy cluster merger, providing insights into cluster evolution and the impact of mergers on intracluster medium properties.

Method: X-ray observations were analyzed to measure surface brightness, gas temperatures, and hydrostatic masses. The authors used thermodynamic maps, centroid shifts, and Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump conditions to assess merger dynamics.

Result: The system consists of two subclusters with a mass ratio of ~1:1.7, exhibiting disturbed structures like X-ray tails, pressure bridges, and a weak shock with Mach number 1.41. The merger is inferred to be off-axis and near core passage (within 0.5 Gyr).

Conclusion: The findings highlight merger-driven ICM disturbances, showcase the effectiveness of X-ray diagnostics for tracking merger phases, and support models predicting the influence of merger geometry on cluster evolution.

Abstract: We present an X-ray analysis of the merging galaxy cluster system PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 ($z=0.29$) using archival XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. The surface brightness image is bimodal, elongated east-west with a projected core separation of $\sim 1.35$ Mpc. We measure gas temperatures of 5.36 keV for the eastern subcluster (PSZ-E) and 5.44 keV for the western component (PSZ-W). Assuming isothermal intracluster gas, the hydrostatic masses are $\log(M_{500}/M_\odot)=14.76$ for PSZ-E and 14.54 for PSZ-W, implying a mass ratio of $\sim 1:1.7$. PSZ-E shows X-ray concentration indices of $c_{40}/c_{400}=0.124$ and $c_{100}/c_{500}=0.278$, together with a centroid shift of $w=0.016$, indicating a disturbed halo that still hosts a compact cool core; PSZ-W is comparably disturbed even in its core. Both subclusters exhibit ICM asymmetries consistent with ram-pressure stripping, and PSZ-W displays an X-ray tail extending nearly to the outskirts of PSZ-E. The orientation and length of this tail support an off-axis merger geometry. Thermodynamic maps reveal a hot ($\sim 7.3$ keV), high-pressure, high-entropy bridge between the cores. From the Rankine-Hugoniot temperature jump, we infer a Mach number $M=1.41^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$, consistent with a weak merger shock propagating at $1620^{+500}_{-420}$ km s$^{-1}$. These results indicate a merger with a non-zero impact parameter, likely observed near core passage ($\lesssim 0.5$ Gyr before or after), with the pre-pericenter scenario slightly preferred based on the projected separation and thermodynamic structure.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates whether the ultra-high energy neutrino event KM3-230213A originates from pulsar-powered optical transients, concluding that LFBOTs' diffuse neutrino flux could explain the event.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if pulsar-powered optical transients like SNe, SLSNe, and LFBOTs can account for the detected ultra-high energy neutrino, providing insights into potential sources for high-energy neutrino telescopes.

Method: Parameter space scanning of magnetic field strength and spin period to model optical and neutrino emissions from transient populations, evaluating their ability to match the observed neutrino's energy and flux.

Result: LFBOT populations are identified as capable of producing the required diffuse neutrino flux and energy, aligning with the KM3-230213A event characteristics.

Conclusion: Pulsar-powered optical transients, particularly LFBOTs, are viable candidates for ultra-high energy neutrino sources, significant for future neutrino telescope studies.

Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration reported the detection of an ultra-high energy ($\sim 220$ PeV) neutrino event, KM3-230213A. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into whether this event could originate from the diffuse neutrino flux produced by a class of pulsar-powered optical transients. In particular, we consider populations of ordinary supernovae (SNe), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) with a newly formed magnetar as the central engine. We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies. Combining our results, we conclude that a diffuse neutrino flux from a population of LFBOTs can explain the KM3NeT event. Therefore, pulsar-powered optical transients may serve as promising sources for the current and upcoming high-energy and ultra-high energy neutrino telescopes.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new hierarchical semi-coherent search pipeline for detecting and analyzing gravitational waves from XMRIs (extremely large mass-ratio inspirals involving brown dwarfs and supermassive black holes) using space-based detectors like TianQin. It successfully demonstrates high-precision parameter estimation for XMRIs in simulated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XMRIs emit long-lived, monochromatic gravitational waves ideal for testing strong-field gravity and studying black hole properties, but existing analysis methods are inadequate. The need exists for specialized data pipelines tailored to space-based detectors.

Method: Developed a hierarchical semi-coherent search combining multi-harmonic F-statistic with particle swarm optimization. Included a novel eccentricity estimation method using harmonic power distributions. Tested with simulated TianQin data for a Galactic center XMRI involving Sgr A*.

Result: For a 3-month observation, the pipeline successfully recovered signals with high precision: <1e-6 uncertainty in orbital frequency, ~0.1% in eccentricity, ~0.2% in black hole mass, and ~0.1% in black hole spin.

Conclusion: This pipeline establishes a foundational method for future XMRI searches with space-based detectors, underscoring XMRIs' potential as precision tools for studying stellar dynamics and strong-field gravity near supermassive black holes.

Abstract: Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), consisting of a brown dwarf orbiting a supermassive black hole, emit long-lived and nearly monochromatic gravitational waves in the millihertz band and constitute a promising probe of strong-field gravity and black-hole properties. However, dedicated data-analysis pipelines for XMRI signals have not yet been established. In this work, we develop, for the first time, a hierarchical semi-coherent search pipeline for XMRIs tailored to space-based gravitational-wave detectors, with a particular focus on the TianQin mission. The pipeline combines a semi-coherent multi-harmonic $\mathcal{F}$-statistic with particle swarm optimization, and incorporates a novel eccentricity estimation method based on the relative power distribution among harmonics. We validate the performance of the pipeline using simulated TianQin data for a Galactic center XMRI composed of a brown dwarf and Sgr A*. For a three-month observation, the pipeline successfully recovers the signal and achieves high-precision parameter estimation, including fractional uncertainties of $<10^{-6}$ in the orbital frequency, $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the eccentricity, $\lesssim2\times10^{-3}$ in the black-hole mass, and $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the black-hole spin. Our framework establishes a practical foundation for future XMRI searches with space-based detectors and highlights the potential of XMRIs as precision probes of stellar dynamics and strong-field gravity in the vicinity of supermassive black holes.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates whether tidal disruption events and accretion flares with IR echoes contribute to cosmic neutrinos by cross-matching NEOWISE flares with IceCat-1 neutrino alerts, finding only one spatial coincidence (consistent with chance) and no temporal matches, questioning previous conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the hypothesis that accretion flares with strong IR echoes, such as tidal disruption events, contribute to the observed diffuse high-energy neutrino signal.

Method: Compiled a sample of nearby accretion flares from NEOWISE with strong IR echoes; cross-matched with IceCat-1 neutrino alert catalog; analyzed spatial and temporal coincidences.

Result: Only one spatial coincidence found (chance probability), no temporal-spatial correlations observed.

Conclusion: Current data challenge previous claims linking such flares to neutrino production; calls for future observations and improved flare selection criteria.

Abstract: The physical origin of the observed cosmic neutrinos remains an open question and the subject of active research. While matter accretion onto supermassive black holes is long thought to accelerate particles to high energies, it has recently been suggested that tidal disruption events, and accretion flares in general, with prominent IR echoes can account for a fraction of the diffuse high-energy neutrino signal. Motivated by this result, we compile a sample of nearby accretion flares detected in the NEOWISE survey featuring strong IR echoes, and we cross-match it with the latest catalog of neutrino alerts, IceCat-1. We recover only a single spatial coincidence between the two catalogs, consistent with a chance coincidence. We find no temporal and spatial coincidences between the two samples, which, given the properties of our sample, appears to challenge previous conclusions. We discuss the physical implications of our results and potential future explorations.

Result: Highly accurate approximation of zeroth and first harmonic coefficients, validated for use in latitude measurements during marine expeditions.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses cosmic ray variations, providing reliable data correction for practical navigation and research purposes.

Abstract: When solving scientific and applied problems, such as latitude monitoring, it is important to correctly exclude primary cosmic ray variations from observation data. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and implement a method for correcting monitoring data, the key point of which was to obtain reception coefficients as a function of latitude. This resulted in an approximation of the rigidity dependence of the zeroth and first harmonic cosmic rays anisotropy coefficients, calculated for a ground-based cosmic ray detectors network. Analysis of the obtained results showed that the approximation was performed with high accuracy, and the results are suitable for use in latitude measurements during marine expeditions.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new analytic model (xwind) for Fe-Kα emission lines from BLR-scale wind in AGN, validated using XRISM data on NGC 4151, offering computationally efficient modeling of this intermediate component.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling complex Fe-Kα line profiles observed by XRISM, which involve contributions from multiple structures including an underrepresented BLR-scale wind component.

Method: Developed an analytic model for emission line profiles from a BLR-scale wind, inspired by reverberation mapping evidence. Applied it to XRISM observations of NGC 4151, comparing model outputs with observed data.

Result: The model successfully reproduces smooth line profiles in NGC 4151 data, yielding physically plausible parameters. It efficiently captures the intermediary BLR component's contribution without computational burdens.

Conclusion: The xwind model provides a fast, physically motivated tool for analyzing AGN Fe-Kα profiles, enabling better understanding of BLR-scale winds. Publicly available code facilitates community use and future studies.

Abstract: XRISM has provided an unprecedented view of the emission and absorption lines in the X-ray. Notably, early results showed significant complexity to the Fe-K$α$ line profile in AGN, with clear contributions from at least three emitting structures: an inner disc, intermediary broad line region (BLR) scale material, and an outer torus. This poses a new challenge for the modelling of the emission lines, as while fast sophisticated models exist for disc line-profiles, large scale-height material is typically much more complex. In this paper we aim to address this gap, by building a fully analytic model for the emission line profiles from a wind, aimed towards BLR scale material, motivated on previous reverberation studies suggesting a wind on the inner edge of the BLR. Our approach gives a physically motivated, yet computationally fast, model for the intermediary component to the Fe-K$α$ complex seen in the XRISM data. We demonstrate our model on the XRISM observations of NGC 4151 from the performance verification phase, showing that it gives a good description of the data, with physically reasonable parameters for BLR scale material. We also show that our model naturally gives the smooth line profile seen in the data, due to the large spatial extent of a wind. Finally, we make our model code public to the community, and name it xwind.

Motivation: To address the discrepancy between observed rpTDEs and theoretical models, specifically their high fraction compared to loss cone channel predictions, and explore alternative formation pathways.

Method: Derives an inequality relating SMBH mass and orbital period for rpTDEs in the loss cone channel. Analyzes existing rpTDE candidates against this inequality. Considers implications for the Hills mechanism and hypervelocity star production.

Result: Most reported rpTDE candidates violate the proposed inequality, indicating alternative formation channels. The Hills mechanism may explain rpTDEs but predicts HVSs not yet observed.

Conclusion: A shift is needed toward binary-based mechanisms like the Hills channel to explain rpTDEs. Future observations targeting HVSs in the Milky Way are critical to validate these predictions.

Abstract: A number of candidate repeating partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs) have been reported in recent years. If these events are confirmed, the high fraction of observed rpTDEs among all tidal disruption events (TDEs) is in tension with prediction of the loss cone channel. We further point out an inequality $M_\bullet \lesssim 4\times 10^6 M_\odot (T_{\rm obt}/10\ {\rm yr})^{4/9}$ that must be satisfied for rpTDEs of solar type stars in the loss cone channel, where $M_\bullet$ is the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and $T_{\rm obt}$ is the orbital period of the star. However the majority of reported rpTDE candidates potentially violate this inequality, indicating an alternative formation channel. In the commonly invoked Hills mechanism, the captured stars produced by tidal disruption of near-contact binaries can evade this inequality and may be the dominant source of rpTDEs. If the same process operates in the Galactic Center, there should exist a population of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected with velocities as high as $3.6\times 10^3 (M_\bullet/10^6 M_\odot)^{1/6}\ {\rm km\ s}^{-1}$, which however have not been detected. A complete search for HVSs in the Milky Way will be critical for testing this prediction.

### [30] [On the dynamics of magnetoviscous warped discs around compact objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22683)
*Arthur G. Suvorov,Kostas Glampedakis*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines how warped accretion discs around compact objects like neutron stars and black holes behave under relativistic effects and magnetic fields, finding that strong magnetic fields can alter viscosity and stabilize the disc, potentially affecting mass infall rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of tilted accretion discs influenced by general relativistic frame-dragging and magnetic fields, particularly how these factors affect viscosity and instability thresholds, which are critical for modeling mass accretion processes in systems like X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

Method: Semi-analytic analysis incorporating relativistic hydrodynamics, including gas-parcel orbits and external magnetic Lorentz forces, to model warp modes and their impact on perpendicular viscosity in accretion discs.

Result: Intense magnetic fields can create new warp modes and avoided crossings that reduce perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington rates, implying weaker magnetic fields might be sufficient to destabilize discs compared to previous estimates.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that magnetic fields in systems such as neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud AGNs may more easily induce disc tearing, altering our understanding of mass accretion dynamics in these environments.

Abstract: Accretion discs that are tilted with respect to their compact hosts can warp out-of-plane through general relativistic frame-dragging. Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei.

### [31] [A unified framework for hot accretion flows with finite angular momentum: from Bondi-like to disc-like regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22726)
*Cheng-Liang Jiao,Liying Zhu,Er-gang Zhao,Xiang-dong Shi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework for accretion flows in elliptical galaxies that bridges the gap between Bondi accretion and ADAFs, showing that significant accretion rates can persist even with angular momentum when viscosity is accounted for.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theories treat Bondi accretion and ADAFs as separate cases without addressing flows with moderate angular momentum. Observations indicate high accretion rates in galaxies, necessitating a unified model.

Method: Developed a model that continuously connects Bondi and ADAF regimes, considering angular momentum and viscosity effects. Analyzed how these factors jointly regulate the accretion rate.

Result: The model successfully recovers Bondi and ADAF limits and describes intermediate states. High viscosity allows accretion rates close to Bondi even with significant angular momentum.

Conclusion: The framework explains observed accretion rates in galaxies with realistic viscosity and angular momentum, unifying previous theoretical limits.

Abstract: Observations of X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies suggest that the accretion rate onto the central supermassive black hole can reach a substantial fraction of the Bondi rate. However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper reports the discovery of strong radio emission from the Be/X-ray binary A0538-66 using ASKAP and subsequent MeerKAT observations, revealing it as one of the most radio-luminous neutron star X-ray binaries. The radio emission shows orbital modulation, suggesting a connection to the system's eccentric orbit and accretion dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the unique properties of A0538-66, a Be/X-ray binary with rare super-Eddington accretion events and transient flares, and to explore the mechanisms behind its unexpectedly strong radio emission.

Method: The study uses radio observations from ASKAP for initial discovery and MeerKAT for weekly monitoring to track radio emission variability. Comparisons with other similar systems and analysis of orbital modulation were conducted to identify emission mechanisms.

Result: MeerKAT detected radio luminosity up to ~3e22 erg/s/Hz, showing orbital modulation. The findings highlight A0538-66's status as a highly radio-luminous system, distinct from typical neutron star binaries.

Conclusion: The results suggest A0538-66's radio emission is linked to its eccentric orbit and accretion processes. It represents a new subclass of radio-luminous neutron star binaries, requiring further theoretical modeling to explain the emission mechanisms within its unique parameters.

Abstract: We present the discovery of radio emission from the Be/X-ray binary A0538-66 with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and results from a subsequent weekly monitoring campaign with the MeerKAT radio telescope. A0538-66, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, hosts a neutron star with a short spin period ($P \approx 69$ ms) in a highly eccentric $\approx16.6$-day orbit. Its rare episodes of super-Eddington accretion, rapid optical and X-ray flares, and other peculiar properties make it an interesting system among high-mass X-ray binaries. Our MeerKAT data reveal that it is also one of the most radio-luminous neutron star X-ray binaries observed to date, reaching $\approx 3 \times 10^{22}~\text{erg}~\text{s}^{-1} \text{Hz}^{-1}$, with radio emission that appears to be orbitally modulated. We consider several possible mechanisms for the radio emission, and place A0538-66 in context by comparing it to similar systems.

### [33] [Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from the Galactic Center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22747)
*V. N. Zirakashvili,S. I. Rogovaya*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Analysis of cosmic ray spectrum beyond 1 PeV attributes it to Eddington-like accretion events in the Galactic Center, particle acceleration in associated shocks/jets, and confinement within an extended (hundreds of kiloparsecs) Galactic halo magnetized at a minimum field strength of 2x10^-7 Gauss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic ray spectrum (above 1 PeV) observed in the Galaxy, which cannot be accounted for by traditional galactic sources alone.

Method: Modeling energetic processes during massive Eddington-like accretion events, simulating particle acceleration mechanisms at astrophysical shocks and jets, and calculating confinement parameters based on halo magnetic field requirements.

Result: The scenario successfully reproduces cosmic ray spectra above 1 PeV, requiring a Galactic halo size ~hundreds of kiloparsecs with minimum magnetic field ~2e-7 Gauss for effective particle containment.

Conclusion: Eddington-scale accretion events in the Galactic Center are viable primary sources for ultra-high energy cosmic rays when considering magnetic field confinement in an extended Galactic halo.

Abstract: It is shown that Eddington-like accretion event in the Galactic center several million years ago and particle acceleration at accompanying shocks and jets could explain the observed cosmic ray spectrum at energies above 1 PeV. Cosmic ray particles are confined in extended (several hundred kiloparsec in size) Galactic halo. It is shown that the halo magnetic field could be as small as $2\times 10^{-7}$ G for the effective confinement.

*Riki Matsui,Shigeo S. Kimura,Kohta Murase,Bing Theodore Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the detectability of multi-wavelength emissions from GRB X-ray flares and extended emissions, identifying conditions under which ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray signals can be observed by specific instruments, which helps constrain jet parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand GRB jet physics by analyzing XFs/EEs and their detectability across wavelengths, addressing uncertainties in critical parameters like dissipation radius and Lorentz factor.

Method: The authors model XFs/EEs as optically-thin synchrotron emissions from relativistic jets, simulate multi-wavelength emissions considering ranges of r_diss and Γ, then assess detection feasibility with Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO.

Result: Simultaneous UV and VHE gamma-ray emissions from XFs/EEs can be detected ~every 3 years, with detection/non-detection rates critical for constraining jet parameters.

Conclusion: Multi-wavelength observations of XFs/EEs are essential for determining key GRB jet properties, and future missions like SVOM and CTAO will significantly advance this understanding.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most extreme transients in the universe, but their explosion and emission mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the nature of GRB jets, here we focus on X-ray flares (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs), which are X-ray emissions that occur 100 to 1000 seconds after the main burst. They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $Γ$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years. The detection and non-detection rates for each detector are key to determining the uncertain yet essential values necessary for understanding the physics of GRB jets.

*Megumi Shidatsu,Maxime Parra*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the significance of disk winds in black hole X-ray binaries, their potential impact on accretion disk structure and environment, and the role of the XRISM mission's Resolve instrument in advancing understanding of wind mechanisms and mass accretion rate influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poorly understood mechanisms of disk wind launching and their response to mass accretion rate changes, utilizing the advanced capabilities of XRISM's Resolve instrument.

Method: Review of pre-XRISM research, analysis of XRISM observation data, and projection of future studies to explore disk wind dynamics and accretion processes.

Result: XRISM's Resolve provides unprecedented spectral resolution, enabling detailed study of wind properties and their connection to accretion rates, potentially revising current models.

Conclusion: XRISM observations are crucial for unraveling wind mechanisms and their roles in accretion disk dynamics, setting a foundation for future astrophysical studies on black hole systems.

Abstract: Powerful outflows along the accretion disk, known as disk winds, are sometimes launched in black hole X-ray binaries. These winds often manifest themselves in X-ray spectra as blueshifted, highly ionized absorption lines. Previous observations suggest that the mass loss rate from the disk due to disk winds can be comparable to or even more than the mass accretion rate onto the black hole, indicating that disk winds likely play crucial roles in shaping the accretion disk structure and affecting the surrounding environment. However, the mechanisms driving these winds, as well as how their structure changes in response to variations in the mass accretion rate, remain poorly understood. The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), launched in September 2023, is equipped with Resolve, a cutting-edge X-ray micro-calorimeter that delivers unprecedented spectral resolution. Resolve is expected to significantly advance our understanding of wind launching mechanisms and their impact on accretion processes and environments. In this article, we review the progress made in the pre-XRISM era, highlight key results obtained from XRISM observations to date, and outline future prospects.

### [36] [Equatorially Asymmetric Magnetic Fields and Their Impact on Black Hole Accretion Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22894)
*Ishika Palit,Indu Kalpa Dihingia,Yosuke Mizuno,Hsiang-Yi Karen Yang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Investigated how equatorial asymmetry in magnetic fields affects accretion around a spinning black hole using simulations with varying plasma beta values. Found asymmetric outflows and changes in accretion rates, especially at lower beta, emphasizing the need for 3D studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of magnetic field asymmetry in shaping accretion dynamics, angular momentum transport, and outflows around black holes.

Method: Axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a Fishbone-Moncrief torus with equatorially asymmetric magnetic fields parameterized by angles (30°, 45°, 60°) and plasma beta (0.007, 0.005, 0.001).

Result: Asymmetric magnetic fields caused inner disk structural changes, asymmetric poloidal outflows, and variable accretion rates. Effects intensified at lower beta (dominant magnetic pressure), with strong asymmetries at 30° and β=0.001.

Conclusion: Equatorial magnetic asymmetry significantly impacts relativistic accretion flows and variability, necessitating further 3D investigations to explore black hole magnetospheres comprehensively.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field geometry on accretion dynamics around a spinning black hole using axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $60^\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($β= 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\circ$ case at $β= 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows. These findings motivate future extensions to full three-dimensional studies, where black hole magnetosphere can be explored in a more general setting.

*A. De Rújula*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper uses an AI (Perplexity.ai) to compare the Standard and Cannonball models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), aiming to avoid biases from human interpretation and allow an impartial evaluation of which model better fits observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to objectively assess the two competing models of GRBs by leveraging AI to analyze data and models without human bias, facilitating clearer conclusions.

Method: The AI, Perplexity.ai, was tasked with confronting observational GRB data against the predictions of the Standard and Cannonball models. The analysis was conducted without human intervention beyond initiating the query, ensuring minimization of experimenter bias.

Result: The AI's analysis purportedly enables readers to draw clear conclusions about the adequacy of each model in explaining the data, though specific results aren't detailed here.

Conclusion: The conclusion likely emphasizes the utility of AI in unbiased model comparison, suggesting that such a methodology could guide future astrophysical research by reducing subjective influences in interpreting data against theoretical frameworks.

Abstract: There are two well documented models of gamma ray bursts (GRBs), the "Standard' model and the "Cannonball" model. They have often been reviewed [1] and sometimes compared [2]. Here, to avoid understandable biases, I show below the results of an experiment: letting an AI compare the data and the two models. All of what follows (but two references, two footnotes and the next sentence) is the result of asking Perplexity.ai to perform this confrontational task. It should be easy for an impartial reader to reach very clear conclusions.

### [38] [Physical origin of very-high-energy gamma rays from the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 4278 and implications for neutrino observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23242)
*Shilong Chen,Abhishek Das,B. Theodore Zhang,Shigeo S. Kimura,Kohta Murase,Yunfeng Liang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper examines the origin of VHE emission in the low-luminosity AGN NGC 4278 using multi-wavelength data. A leptohadronic model with external inverse-Compton scattering of RIAF photons best explains the observed SED, requiring moderate jet parameters. Neutrino detection潜力 is predicted but subdominant to current IceCube limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the discrepancy between observed VHE flux from NGC 4278 and standard SSC model predictions under low X-ray conditions from Swift-XRT monitoring. Address emission mechanism uncertainties in low-luminosity AGNs.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis combining Swift-XRT X-ray data with LHAASO VHE observations. Broadband SED modeling using AMES code comparing SSC vs. EIC scenarios. Leptohadronic neutrino production calculations incorporating proton interactions in jet.

Result: EIC model with RIAF seed photons better reproduces SED with reasonable parameters (δ ~1-3). SSC requires unphysical high Doppler factors. Predicted neutrino flux Nνμ ~0.001 events for 15-year IceCube exposure under 0.1% Eddington proton partitioning.

Conclusion: EIC mechanism provides a viable explanation for NGC 4278's VHE emission without extreme jet parameters. Multi-messenger observations (neutrinos, more data) needed to distinguish models and understand high-energy processes in LLAGNs.

Abstract: Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to accelerate particles to extreme energies, yet the physical origin of very-high-energy (VHE) emission from low-luminosity AGNs (LL AGNs) remains unclear. NGC 4278, a local LLAGN, has recently been identified as a VHE source following detections by LHAASO. In this study, we present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger analysis to investigate the physical origin of this emission. Swift-XRT monitoring reveals a quasi-quiescent state characterized by a low X-ray flux. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with the leptohadronic code AMES, we find that a standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model underpredicts the VHE flux by $\sim$70% due to the insufficient target photon density provided by the weak X-ray emission, unless a high Doppler factor ($δ\gtrsim 5$) is invoked. Alternatively, an external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario-scattering seed photons from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)-successfully reproduces the broadband spectral energy distribution with a modest jet power and Doppler factor. We further explore the neutrino production within a leptohadronic framework. The predicted muon neutrino event rate is highest in the EIC quiescent model, reaching $N_{ν_μ} \sim 0.001$ for a 15-year IceCube observation (assuming 0.1% of the Eddington luminosity is partitioned into high-energy protons). Future multi-messenger observations are essential to unveil the details of the high-energy processes of NGC 4278.

### [39] [Azimuthal angular entanglement between decaying particles in ultra-peripheral ion collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22212)
*Spencer R. Klein*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores quantum correlations in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions, focusing on multi-photon interactions that produce entangled vector mesons with shared polarization. By comparing classical vs quantum predictions for azimuthal correlations, the study highlights potential tests of multi-particle entanglement analogous to Bell inequality tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate unique quantum correlations arising from shared photon polarization in UPC photonuclear events, which offer a novel system to study multi-particle entanglement and test quantum mechanics predictions against classical alternatives.

Method: Compare classical and quantum mechanical calculations of azimuthal angular correlations in multi-particle final states from UPC photoproduction. Analyze how shared photon polarization induces entanglement detectable through decay patterns.

Result: The two approaches predict divergent azimuthal correlations, similar to Bell test scenarios. UPC systems uniquely allow entanglement of three or more particles, revealing new multi-particle entanglement phenomena.

Conclusion: UPC photonuclear interactions provide a powerful platform to study quantum entanglement in complex systems, offering experimentally accessible tests of quantum mechanics via multi-particle azimuthal correlations.

Abstract: Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) involving relativistic heavy ions are a unique laboratory to study quantum correlations. The intense electromagnetic fields generate high rates of photonuclear interactions, including events involving multiple photon exchange. Multiple photon exchange can result in the production of multiple vector mesons and/or nuclear excitations. These interactions share a common impact parameter, so the photons have the same linear polarization. The shared polarization entangles the particles, leading to unique quantum correlations. The decays of these vector excitations are sensitive to this polarization, allowing for the study of these correlations.
  This letter will compare classical and quantum calculations of the correlations between these azimuthal directions. The two approaches predict vert different angular correlations. The differences are akin to those seen with polarized photons in tests of Bells inequality. Uniquely, UPC photoproduction can produce final states containing three or more particles, all entangled with the same polarization. These more complex states exhibit additional unique phenomenology, allowing new tests of multi-particle entanglement.

### [40] [Axions on a Hyperbolic Ride: Geometric Suppression of CMB Isocurvature and a Blue-Tilted Spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22221)
*Sai Chaitanya Tadepalli*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that high-scale inflation and large QCD axion decay constants in pre-inflationary PQ scenarios might coexist by incorporating curved field-space geometry, specifically a hyperbolic metric, which dynamically suppresses isocurvature fluctuations through a geometric mass term without explicit PQ symmetry breaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tension between CMB-imposed limits on cold dark matter isocurvature and the desire for high-scale inflation with large PQ decay constants, which are typically considered incompatible.

Method: Introduces a minimal complex PQ scalar with a $U(1)$-symmetric potential and nonlinear sigma-model kinetic term having curved target-space geometry ($f(R)=L\sinh(R/L)$). Analyzes the effect of this geometry on the axion fluctuation's mass during inflation, resulting in suppressed isocurvature modes. Provides numerical benchmarks and semi-analytic templates.

Result: Shows that inflationary Hubble scales up to $10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ can be compatible with $f_a \sim 10^{14}-10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, reopening previously excluded parameter space. Predicts a characteristic blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum tied to the geometric lever arm $R/L$.

Conclusion: Field-space geometry provides a viable solution to reconcile high-scale inflation and large PQ decay constants, offering a testable phenomenological probe of axion field dynamics via CMB isocurvature measurements.

Abstract: CMB limits on cold-dark-matter isocurvature are often interpreted as excluding the simultaneous realization of high-scale inflation and large QCD axion decay constants in pre-inflationary Peccei--Quinn (PQ) scenarios. We show that this conclusion can be evaded by exploiting \emph{field-space geometry}. For a minimal complex PQ scalar with a $U(1)$-symmetric potential and nonlinear sigma-model kinetic term $dσ^{2}=dR^{2}+f^{2}(R)\,dθ^{2}$, a curved target-space metric endows the axion fluctuation with a time-dependent geometric mass during inflation, suppressing isocurvature without explicit PQ breaking and without extreme radial displacements. Specializing to a hyperbolic metric $f(R)=L\sinh(R/L)$ with curvature scale $L$, we find that for $R\gtrsim L$ the canonically normalized angular mode can be generically $\mathcal{O}(H_{\rm inf})$-heavy during radial slow-roll, dynamically damping CMB-scale fluctuations while producing a characteristic blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum. As a result, inflationary Hubble scales as large as $H_{\rm inf}\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ can be compatible with $f_a\sim 10^{14}$--$10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, reopening parameter space usually regarded as excluded. We present numerical benchmarks and a semi-analytic template that relates the scale-dependence of isocurvature to the geometric lever arm $R/L$, providing a direct phenomenological probe on PQ field-space geometry.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines spin correlations and CP properties in Higgs boson decays to gluons using observables like the four-point energy-energy correlator (E4C). It finds that E4C with n=4 is most sensitive, and future lepton colliders can probe gluon spin correlations and CP-mixing angles with specific luminosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate methods for probing spin correlations and CP-violation in H→gg decays, which are essential for testing the Standard Model and searching for new physics at future lepton colliders.

Method: Analyzes Lund observables based on subjets and the four-point energy-energy correlator (E4C), focusing on optimal energy weighting (n=4) and strategies for realistic detector-level analysis.

Result: E4C with n=4 shows strongest sensitivity to gluon spin correlations. Future colliders at 240 GeV with 5.6 ab⁻¹ can probe spin correlations, while 20 ab⁻¹ allows CP-mixing angle precision of ≤0.03π.

Conclusion: The framework provides a new path for precision tests of the Standard Model and new physics via H→gg decay analysis, emphasizing the importance of E4C and realistic detector methodologies.

Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of partonic spin correlations and $\mathcal{CP}$ properties in $H\to gg$ decay channel at future lepton colliders. We investigate two classes of observables: Lund observable defined based on subjets and four-point energy-energy correlator (E4C) between particles inside two jets. Our results show that the E4C with energy weighted to the power of \(n=4\) achieves the strongest sensitivity to the spin correlations of gluons from Higgs boson decay. Under the assumption of ideal identification of different gluon splitting modes, we estimate that future lepton colliders operating at \(\sqrt{s}=240~\mathrm{GeV}\) with an integrated luminosities of \(5.6~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}\) can successfully probe gluon spin correlations, while \(20~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}\) of data can probe the $\mathcal{CP}$-mixing angle in the \(Hgg\) coupling to \(\lesssim 0.03π\) using E4C. We outline strategies for extending this framework to realistic detector-level analyses, which can provide a new pathway for the precision test of Standard Model and searches for new physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tension in $δ_{CP}$ measurements between T2K and NOvA experiments and explore potential beyond-the-Standard-Model physics through neutrino oscillations.

Method: Employ a model-independent NSI parameterization to analyze IceCube DeepCore's data and assess its capability to detect NSI effects contributing to the $δ_{CP}$ discrepancy.

Result: Evaluates IceCube DeepCore's potential to constrain NSI parameters and determine if NSI can resolve the observed experimental tension.

Conclusion: IceCube DeepCore could provide critical insights into NSI-induced effects on neutrino oscillations, offering a path to resolve CP phase inconsistencies and advance BSM physics exploration.

Abstract: Neutrino oscillations continue to provide one of the most promising avenues for uncovering physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, beyond-standard-model neutrino matter interactions may perturb neutrino oscillations in matter, leading to an observable signal in long baseline oscillation experiments. Moreover, such interactions can be a possible explanation of the rising tension between T2K and NOvA's $δ_{\text{CP}}$ measurements. We examine IceCube DeepCore's sensitivity to these Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) by employing a model-independent NSI parameterization, and examine IceCube DeepCore's ability to comment on NSI being the cause of the T2K-NOvA $δ_{\text{CP}}$ tension.

Method: Constructed a phenomenological interaction vertex coupling the inflaton to D-term sectors of chiral/anti-chiral superfields, contrasted with conventional Yukawa couplings between inflaton and matter fields, theoretically analyzed the resulting gravitational wave spectra.

Result: Supersymmetric chiral multiplet structures caused a significant (~10x) enhancement in gravitational wave amplitude compared to non-supersymmetric Yukawa couplings.

Conclusion: The interplay between reheating-era gravitational waves and supersymmetric models is worth further investigation, as these effects could provide observable signatures of supersymmetry in cosmological backgrounds.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility that supersymmetric structures may leave observable imprints in the stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background generated during the reheating era. To this end, we construct a phenomenological interaction vertex describing the coupling between a single inflaton and the D-term sectors of a pair of chiral and anti-chiral superfields. In contrast to the conventional Yukawa coupling between the inflaton and structureless matter fields, we find that the supersymmetry-preserving chiral multiplet structure leads to a substantial enhancement, by at least one order of magnitude, in the amplitude of the resulting GWs spectrum. Our results therefore suggest that the interplay between reheating-era stochastic GWs and supersymmetric phenomenology merits further exploration and development.

*Jie Mei,Rui Wen,Min Zhou,Shijun Mao,Mei Huang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates how neutral and charged pions' spectral functions change under a strong magnetic field using the NJL model. The study reveals distinct behaviors: π₀ shows multi-peak structures from Landau levels and chiral effects, while π± exhibit damping via Landau cuts that reduce with rising temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of magnetic fields, temperature, and chiral symmetry on pion properties in extreme QCD conditions, addressing theoretical gaps in meson behavior under such environments.

Method: The study employs the SU(2) NJL model with the Ritus method to analyze spectral functions of π₀ and π± under uniform magnetic fields, considering thermal effects and chiral symmetry restoration.

Result: π₀ spectral functions display multi-peak structures influenced by Landau levels and chiral restoration near critical temperatures, while π± show Landau cuts and narrowing decay widths at higher temperatures, indicating increased stability.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the significance of magnetic field-effects and thermal variations on pion properties, emphasizing their role in extreme QCD environments and the need for further exploration into chiral dynamics under such conditions.

Abstract: This study examines the spectral functions of neutral ($π_0$) and charged ($π_{\pm}$) pions under a uniform magnetic field using the SU(2) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the Ritus method. The analysis highlights the complex interplay of magnetic field effects, thermal influences, and chiral symmetry on meson properties in extreme QCD environments. For $π_0$, whose properties are governed by the behavior of its constituent quarks, magnetic field-induced Landau levels lead to a multi-peak structure in its spectral function, reflecting stable and resonance solutions that evolve with temperature, showing shifts and critical enhancements near chiral restoration. For $π_{\pm}$, cross terms that come from the asymmetry between the constituent quarks introduce Landau cuts alongside Unitary cuts, indicating damping effects, with decay widths narrowing at higher temperatures, suggesting increased stability.

*I. V. Obraztsov,A. E. Bondar,A. I. Milstein*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a relativistic potential model for heavy-light mesons, achieving qualitative agreement with experimental data by incorporating relativistic effects, and shows finite predictions for meson masses and radiative transition widths even as the light quark mass approaches zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of previous models that couldn't explain certain experimental data, emphasizing the necessity of relativistic effects for accurate descriptions of heavy quark meson systems.

Method: Relativistic potential model with a minimal number of parameters to calculate meson spectra and radiative transitions involving at least one heavy quark (b or c).

Result: The model successfully aligns with all available experimental data, including previously unexplained results, and demonstrates finite predictions for meson masses and transition widths in the limit of zero light quark mass.

Conclusion: Relativistic effects are critical for accurately modeling heavy-light mesons, and the model's robustness under extreme parameters (zero light quark mass) underscores its theoretical consistency.

Abstract: We discuss the application of a relativistic potential model to the description of the spectrum and radiative transitions in mesons containing at least one heavy quark (b or c). Although the model has a small number of parameters, it is possible to achieve qualitative agreement with all available experimental data, including those that could not be explained by all previous methods. This demonstrates the importance of taking relativistic effects into account. A remarkable property of the relativistic potential model is that the predictions for meson masses and partial widths of radiative transitions remain finite in the limit of zero light quark mass.

### [46] [Singly Cabibbo-suppressed hadronic weak decays of the $Ω^-$ hyperon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22670)
*Ye Cao,Tao Zhong,Ju-Jun Xie,Qiang Zhao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study analyzes the weak decays of the $Ω^-$ hyperon, focusing on three singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay modes. Using a non-relativistic constituent quark model, it explains the dominance of specific decay channels via direct pion emission, pole terms, and rescattering processes, achieving agreement with experimental data and highlighting parity-conserving transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms governing the two-body hadronic weak decays of $Ω^-$ hyperons with strangeness $S=-3$, particularly addressing discrepancies in branching ratios for color-suppressed decay modes and reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental measurements from BESIII.

Method: The analysis employs a non-relativistic constituent quark model to compute decay amplitudes at the quark level, considering $s	o udar{u}$ transitions (direct pion emission and color-suppressed processes) and $su→ud$ transitions (pole terms mediated by $Ξ$ resonances). Final state interactions via rescattering processes are included to resolve discrepancies in branching ratios for the $Ξ^-π^0$ channel.

Result: The $Ξ^0π^-$ decay is dominated by color-allowed direct pion emission, while $ΛK^-$ is explained by pole contributions from $Ξ$ resonances. The $Ξ^-π^0$ channel's low branching ratio is resolved through rescattering processes. Theoretical results align with BESIII data, and all decays are dominated by parity-conserving $P$-wave transitions with near-zero asymmetry parameters.

Conclusion: A unified description of $Ω^-$ decays requires combining quark-level weak vertices, baryon pole structures, and final state rescattering. These mechanisms successfully explain experimental branching ratios and emphasize the role of parity-conserving interactions in these processes.

Abstract: We study the two-body hadronic weak decays of the $Ω^-$ hyperon with strangeness $S=-3$, including three singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay modes: $Ξ^0 π^-$, $Ξ^-π^0$ and $ΛK^-$. The decay amplitudes at the quark level, arising from $s\to ud \bar{u}$ transitions (direct pion emission and color-suppressed processes) and $su\to ud$ transitions (pole terms), are calculated in the framework of the non-relativistic constituent quark model.The theoretical results show that the $Ξ^0 π^-$ channel is dominated by the color-allowed direct pion emission process, while the $ΛK^-$ channel is well described by one type of pole contribution mediated through intermediate $Ξ$ resonances ($1^2S_{1/2^+}$ and $1^2P_{1/2^-}$ states). However, the contribution from tree-level mechanisms alone to the branching ratio of $Ω^- \to Ξ^- π^0$ is small due to its color-suppressed nature. The discrepancy is resolved by including final state interactions through rescattering processes via intermediate states $Ξ^0π^-$ and $ΛK^-$. This work demonstrates that a unified description of $Ω^-$ hadronic weak decays necessitates the interplay of quark-level weak vertices, baryon pole structures, and long-distance final state rescattering dynamics. With these mechanisms, the obtained branching ratios are in agreement with the high-precision experimental data from the BESIII. Furthermore, these above decays are found to be dominated by the parity-conserving $P$-wave transitions, thus the asymmetry parameters are almost zero.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a general analytical framework using the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to study femtoscopic correlation functions in arbitrary partial waves, specifically applying it to constrain d-wave K−p scattering and analyze the properties of the Λ(1520) particle, achieving results consistent with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend femtoscopic correlation analysis beyond s-wave interactions to higher partial waves (like d-wave) and improve constraints on hadron-hadron dynamics, particularly for exotic states and low-energy strong interactions.

Method: Developed a general analytical expression for femtoscopic correlation functions in arbitrary partial waves using the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Applied this to study d-wave K−p scattering through correlation functions and D_{03} scattering amplitudes involving K̄N → K̄N and K̄N → πΣ processes.

Result: Successfully constrained d-wave K−p scattering parameters and extracted properties of the Λ(1520) particle that align well with experimental data, demonstrating the method's feasibility.

Conclusion: The approach provides a viable tool for exploring higher partial wave dynamics in hadron interactions, offering a pathway to enhance understanding of low-energy strong interactions and exotic states.

Abstract: The femtoscopic correlation function has been established in recent years as a high-precision tool for investigating hadron-hadron interactions and exotic states, providing stringent constraints on the dynamics of low-energy strong interactions. However, current research has been predominantly focused on the $s$-wave interaction between hadrons, while studies of higher partial waves remain scarce. We present a general analytical expression for the femtoscopic correlation function in an arbitrary partial wave using the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. This formalism is applied to constrain the $d$-wave $K^-p$ scattering through a combined study of the $K^-p$ correlation function and the $D_{03}$ scattering amplitude of $\bar K N \to \bar K N$ and $\bar K N \to πΣ$ processes, from which the properties of $Λ(1520)$ are extracted and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of determining dynamics between hadrons through femtoscopic correlation functions and scattering amplitudes with higher partial waves.

### [49] [Radiative Dirac Neutrino Masses from Modular $S_3$ Symmetry in an Axion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22740)
*Sin Kyu Kang,Ranjeet Kumar,Hiroshi Okada*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified axion model framework that addresses neutrino masses, leptonic flavor structure, the strong CP problem, and dark matter using a combination of global $U(1)_{m PQ}$ and modular $S_3$ symmetries. It predicts one massless neutrino, impacts lepton $g-2$, and has testable axion-photon coupling predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify explanations for multiple fundamental physics puzzles: neutrino masses' origin, leptonic flavor structure, resolution of the strong CP problem, and dark matter composition, while ensuring consistency with experimental constraints and opening up testable predictions.

Method: The model employs a global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ symmetry with modular $S_3$ symmetry in a KSVZ-type axion setup. Exotic particles mediate radiative neutrino masses at one loop. PQ charge assignment prevents tree-level neutrino masses and enforces residual $Z_3$ symmetry for Dirac neutrinos. Minimal realization yields rank-two neutrino mass matrix.

Result: Predicts one massless neutrino, constraining neutrino mass sums for both hierarchies. Implications for lepton flavor violation and $g-2$ are analyzed. Axion solves strong CP problem and matches dark matter abundance, with axion-photon coupling accessible to future experiments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates diverse physics areas into a coherent model, offering experimentally testable predictions (neutrino mass predictions, axion detection prospects) that can be validated by upcoming experiments and observations.

Abstract: We present a unified axion model framework that simultaneously addresses the origin of neutrino masses, leptonic flavor structure, the strong CP problem, and dark matter. The model is based on a global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ symmetry combined with a modular $S_3$ symmetry and is realized within a novel class of KSVZ-type axion model. Exotic colored fermions and scalars mediate radiative neutrino mass generation at the one loop-level. The PQ charge assignment forbids tree-level neutrino masses and leaves a residual $Z_3$ symmetry that ensures the Dirac nature of neutrinos. In the minimal realization, the neutrino mass matrix is of rank two, predicting one massless neutrino. Consequently, the sum of neutrino masses is constrained for both the normal and inverted hierarchies. We analyze the implications for charged lepton flavor violation and the lepton $g-2$. The axion emerging from this framework dynamically resolves the strong CP problem and accounts for the observed dark matter abundance. Notably, the predicted axion-photon coupling is within reach of upcoming experiments and consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological bounds.

Result: Successful parameter fitting for ICEM. Predicted $J/ψ$ spectra for NICA SPD across various collision energies. Observed differences between TMD+InEW and NRQCD framework results in spectral shapes.

Conclusion: The hybrid TMD+CPM approach with InEW matching effectively describes $J/ψ$ production across transverse momentum regimes. ICEM parameters are constrained, and predictions support NICA SPD experimental planning. The work highlights discrepancies between TMD and NRQCD frameworks needing further investigation.

Abstract: In the article, we study prompt $J/ψ$ production at small transverse momentum within the Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization. The Soft Gluon Resummation (SGR) approach is used for modelling of TMD PDFs. The hadronization process of heavy charm quarks is described with the Improved Color Evaporation model (ICEM). In order to obtain spectra of $J/ψ$ at the arbitrary transverse momenta, fixed-order calculations within the collinear parton model (CPM) are also applied and further matched with the TMD calculations using the Inverse-Error Weighting (InEW) scheme. We present results of calculations for a wide range of collision energy with the fitting of the relevant nonperturbative parameter of the ICEM. Predictions for the SPD NICA experiment are also provided alongside comparison with the result of calculation using nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework.

Method: Constructed an accurate helicity amplitude model with free trajectory parameters based on Regge theory's dipole Pomeron framework. Fitted the model simultaneously to data from three categories to determine 20 parameters, analyzing total and differential cross sections alongside spin-density matrix elements for ρ⁰ photoproduction.

Result: The model significantly outperforms previous models in matching experimental data, successfully describing cross sections and SDMEs.

Conclusion: The developed model is essential for advancing cosmic photon polarimetry techniques and深入 understanding the non-perturbative regime's spin dynamics in strong interactions, highlighting its importance for future experimental and theoretical studies.

Abstract: We present a model with dipole Pomeron bassed on Regge theory framework for vetor meson photoproduction by arbitarily polaried photons. The accurate helicity amplitude is constructed with free trajectory parameters. This model consistently describes the total and momentum-transfer differential cross sections and he spin-density matrix elements in photoproduction of $ρ^{0}$, by fitting it to the data of $3$ categories simultaneously to determine its $20$ parameters. The agreements with experimental data of our model improve those of the previous models remarkably and predictions for circular SDMEs are made. The model provides key description of the process for our innovative polarimetry of cosmic photons and essential insight to explore the non-perturbative regime and the spin dynamics of strong interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the formation and stability of multiquark states, particularly in the context of fully-charm systems where quark interchange dynamics may play a key role.

Method: Analyzes existing theoretical frameworks for chromoelectric and chromomagnetic interactions, evaluates their potential to stabilize multiquark systems, and examines quark interchange mechanisms as an alternative explanation.

Result: Identifies that both chromoelectric/chromomagnetic effects and quark interchange processes contribute to the stability/metastability of multiquark configurations, with the latter being prominent in fully-charmed systems.

Conclusion: Multiquark states' stability arises from combined effects of gluonic field configurations and quark rearrangement processes, highlighting the need for further experimental validation in charmed hadron systems.

Abstract: We review the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic mechanisms that tentatively lead to stable or metastable multiquark configurations. An alternative interpretation of the dynamics is the quark interchange between hadrons, as illustrated in the case of the fully-charm systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces polarization harmonics of heavy hadrons as a new observable to probe the initial geometry of relativistic heavy-ion collisions by linking spin polarization effects to initial spatial anisotropies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a sensitive probe for the initial fireball geometry in heavy-ion collisions, leveraging the sensitivity of heavy quark spin polarization to early-time electromagnetic fields and medium-induced depolarization.

Method: Using rotational Brownian motion framework to model the depolarization of heavy quarks' spin as they traverse the quark-gluon plasma, and establishing a relationship between polarization harmonics and initial spatial eccentricities.

Result: Quantitative estimates of the second polarization harmonic are provided, aligning with the ALICE Collaboration's observed $D^{*+}$ spin alignment, demonstrating the approach's validity.

Conclusion: Heavy-flavor polarization anisotropies provide a complementary method to study early-time collision dynamics, offering insights into the initial geometry through their sensitivity to both production mechanisms and medium effects.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to probe the initial fireball geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using spin polarization. Specifically, we introduce polarization harmonics of open heavy hadrons as a novel observable sensitive to geometric anisotropies. Heavy quarks are produced in early hard scatterings and can acquire spin polarization from the strong, transient electromagnetic fields present at early times. As they propagate through the anisotropic quark-gluon plasma, medium-induced interactions lead to path-length dependent depolarization, imprinting an azimuthally anisotropic polarization pattern. Within the framework of rotational Brownian motion, we show that the resulting polarization harmonics are directly related to the initial spatial eccentricities, thereby establishing heavy-flavor polarization anisotropies as a sensitive and complementary probe of the early-time collision geometry. We present quantitative estimates of the second polarization harmonic associated with the recently observed $D^{*+}$ spin alignment reported by the ALICE Collaboration.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines conserved charge fluctuations in QCD using a string-based model of hadron spectra, finding that direct lattice QCD-derived Hagedorn spectra with T_H ≈ 323 MeV align better with lattice results than experimental data-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies between experimental Hagedorn spectrum models and lattice QCD predictions for net-baryon fluctuations, and to validate a string-based quark-diquark baryon model in QCD's confined phase.

Method: Modeled mesons/baryons as relativistic strings with quark endpoints, used exponential Hagedorn state growth, and fitted lattice data for net-baryon susceptibility to extract the Hagedorn temperature without extra parameters.

Result: Achieved consistency with lattice QCD fluctuation data using T_H ≈ 323 MeV, showing lattice-derived spectra outperform experiment-based models.

Conclusion: Provides thermodynamic support for a string-based quark-diquark picture of baryons in confined QCD, reconciling bulk observables with string theory predictions.

Abstract: We study fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges in QCD using a string-based description of the hadronic mass spectrum. Mesons and baryons are modeled as open relativistic strings with quark-antiquark and quark-diquark endpoints, respectively, leading to an exponential Hagedorn growth of states with a limiting temperature fixed by the string tension. We find that continuous Hagedorn spectra constrained by experimentally established hadrons underestimate net-baryon number fluctuations obtained in lattice QCD calculations. By extracting the Hagedorn string spectrum directly from lattice QCD through a fit to the second-order net-baryon number susceptibility, we obtain a consistent description of a broad set of fluctuations of conserved charges from LQCD with the Hagedorn temperature $T_H \simeq 323~$MeV, without introducing additional free parameters. Our results provide thermodynamic evidence in support of a string quark-diquark picture of baryons in the confined phase of QCD.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a local subtraction method to handle infrared singularities in real-virtual NNLO QCD corrections for hadroproduction processes, enabling numerical integration of both loop and phase-space contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of calculating NNLO QCD corrections for hadron collider processes by resolving infrared singularity issues through a unified subtraction scheme.

Method: A local subtraction scheme in momentum space that factorizes infrared limits of real and virtual momenta. The method modifies original Feynman integrands to allow gauge symmetry cancellations, using subtraction terms based on single-Higgs production processes.

Result: Achieves locally finite integrals suitable for direct numerical evaluation, avoiding dimensional regularization. It integrates loop momenta and final-state phase space concurrently.

Conclusion: This approach is a critical advancement for performing NNLO cross-section calculations, especially for colorless final states in hadron colliders, by unifying loop and phase-space integrations numerically.

Abstract: We present a local subtraction scheme that enables the combined integration of loop momenta and the final-state parton phase space in real-virtual NNLO QCD corrections to cross sections for hadroproduction of electroweak and other colorless states. All initial- and final-state infrared singularities are subtracted at the integrand level in momentum space, yielding a locally finite integral ready for numerical integration in four dimensions. The subtraction terms are all based on the well-understood process of single-Higgs production. The core of our subtraction scheme relies on achieving local factorization in all infrared limits of real and virtual momenta. This necessitates systematic modifications of the original Feynman integrand for loop amplitudes, enabling gauge symmetry cancellations before performing integrations. Our approach provides an essential step toward NNLO cross-section calculations for hadron collider processes, where both loop and phase-space integrations are carried out numerically.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates regulator and cutoff artifacts in the quark-meson model using the functional renormalization-group approach, finding minimal effects at low temperatures/chemical potentials but significant cutoff artifacts at high temperatures. Regulator properties impact dynamics near first-order chiral phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of regulator and cutoff dependences in effective models, ensuring renormalization-group consistency for meaningful comparisons in phenomenological studies.

Method: Uses the functional renormalization-group approach with local potential approximation, varying regulators (differing in analytic properties and strongest singularity classification) and a standard range of cutoff values.

Result: Small regulator/cutoff dependencies at low temperatures/chemical potentials; significant cutoff artifacts at high temperatures. Regulator properties influence dynamics near first-order chiral phase transitions at low temperatures/high chemical potentials.

Conclusion: The study highlights the necessity of careful parameter-fixing procedures and regulator selection, particularly in regions with first-order phase transitions, to minimize artifacts and ensure reliable model comparisons.

Abstract: We study regulator and cutoff artifacts in the quark-meson model at finite temperature and quark chemical potential within the functional renormalization-group approach using the local potential approximation. To this end, we discuss the concept of renormalization-group consistency in effective models, which necessitates a nontrivial parameter-fixing procedure to enable a meaningful comparison of results obtained with different regulators and cutoffs. We employ a standard range of cutoff values used in phenomenological studies and regulators that differ significantly in their analytic properties as well as in their classification according to the principle of strongest singularity. We find that regulator and cutoff dependences are small at low temperatures and quark chemical potentials. At high temperatures and low quark chemical potentials, significant cutoff artifacts arise, whereas the properties of the regulator affect the dynamics in the regime governed by a chiral phase transition of first order at low temperatures and high quark chemical potentials.

Motivation: To explore Earth's internal density structure by analyzing neutrino oscillations affected by Earth's matter, using IceCube DeepCore's capabilities to detect multi-GeV neutrinos.

Method: Analyze oscillation patterns of atmospheric neutrinos passing through Earth using IceCube DeepCore data, comparing observed data against predictions from homogeneous vs. layered Earth density profiles.

Conclusion: IceCube DeepCore can probe Earth's density structure via neutrino oscillations, offering a novel geophysical tool independent of traditional seismic methods.

Abstract: The IceCube detector, using its densely instrumented center, called DeepCore, can detect multi-GeV atmospheric neutrinos. The oscillation pattern of neutrinos is altered due to interactions with ambient electrons as they pass through Earth. The changes in these patterns are influenced by the amount of matter and its specific arrangement. As neutrinos propagate, they retain information about the densities they encounter. Our study demonstrates that IceCube DeepCore can utilize the Earth's matter effects to distinguish between a homogeneous matter density profile and a layered structure density profile of Earth. In this contribution, we present that IceCube DeepCore data equivalent to 9.3 years of observation can reject the homogeneous matter density profile with a confidence level of 1.4$σ$.

Result: Derivation of two equivalent holomorphic Hilbert-series bases, explicit construction of dimension-5 and certain dimension-6 operators, and a finite basis for non-holomorphic cases using minimal principles.

Conclusion: Modular flavor symmetries with A₄ groups provide a structured approach in SMEFT, enabling finite operator bases even in non-holomorphic scenarios through systematic principles like minimal organizing assumptions.

Abstract: We implement modular flavor symmetries within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, using the flavor group $A_4^{(q)} \times A_4^{(e)}$ with distinct moduli $τ_q$ and $τ_e$, and assigning different modular weights to right-handed quarks using simplest weight assignment. By treating the moduli as non-dynamical spurions, adopting the MFV-like assumption, and neglecting effects associated with $\mathrm{Im}\,τ$, we systematically construct a finite set of independent modular-invariant higher-dimensional operators via the Hilbert-series techniques. In the holomorphic $A_4$ scenario, where all modular forms derive from the weight-2 triplet $Y^{(2)}_{\mathbf{3}}$, we present two equivalent Hilbert-series bases. This establishes that higher-dimensional operators can be formally organized as $[Y_{\mathbf{r}}^{(k_Y)},{Y_{\mathbf{r}'}^{(k_Y')}}^{*},\mathcal{O}]_{\mathbf{1}}$ singlets. We subsequently enumerate all independent operators up to dimension 7 under this assumption and provide explicit constructions for all dimension-5 operators as well as baryon- and lepton-number conserving dimension-6 operators. Relaxing holomorphicity to the non-holomorphic case of polyharmonic Maas forms, considering that non-holomorphic modular forms are not closed under multiplication, adopting the holomorphic organizing idea would generically lead to an infinite proliferation of modular-invariant structures. To retain a finite and complete operator basis, we therefore impose the same minimal formal organizing principle, which reproduces the benchmark Weinberg operator and the corresponding dimension-$6$ operators.

Motivation: Gravity and seismic methods are the traditional tools for studying Earth's mass and internal structure, but neutrinos provide an alternative approach by leveraging matter effects during oscillations, which depend on Earth's electron density and thus its composition. This method could validate or complement existing results.

Method: The study utilizes atmospheric neutrino data from DeepCore, a high-density sub-detector of the IceCube Observatory, analyzing oscillation patterns affected by Earth's matter. Simulations are performed to assess the potential improvement of measurements with the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, which will enhance detector sensitivity.

Result: Current analysis with DeepCore data provides estimates of Earth's mass and layer densities. Simulations indicate that the IceCube Upgrade will significantly increase the precision of these measurements by reducing statistical uncertainties.

Conclusion: Neutrino-based methods using IceCube and its upgrades offer a novel and powerful technique to probe Earth's interior, showcasing the potential of particle physics for geophysical research. Future upgrades will enhance the accuracy, emphasizing the synergy between physics disciplines.

Abstract: Earth's mass and internal structure have been primarily studied through gravitational and seismic methods. Neutrinos, however, offer an independent way to explore Earth's interior via matter effects in neutrino oscillations that depend on the electron distribution inside Earth, and hence its matter density. Our study uses atmospheric neutrinos at DeepCore, a densely instrumented sub-detector of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, to estimate Earth's mass and layer densities. We also assess how the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, with denser instrumentation, could improve these measurements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore sub-leading BSM physics by studying atmospheric neutrino oscillations using DeepCore's high-statistics data and its capability to detect GeV-range neutrinos, specifically targeting flavor-dependent interactions via a gauged lepton-number symmetry.

Method: Analyze IceCube DeepCore's 9.3-year runtime data to assess sensitivity for detecting a light neutral gauge boson mediating lepton-number-dependent forces, likely involving oscillation parameter fits and comparison with SM expectations.

Result: The paper presents sensitivity projections for IceCube DeepCore to constrain or observe the proposed gauge boson's interaction strength and mass, highlighting potential deviations from Standard Model predictions in neutrino oscillation patterns.

Conclusion: DeepCore's extended runtime enhances its ability to probe BSM physics via neutrino oscillations, offering valuable constraints on flavored gauge extensions even if no signal is observed, and complementing particle accelerator experiments.

Abstract: The IceCube neutrino observatory consists of an array of Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) instrumenting one cubic-kilometer of deep glacial ice at the South Pole. DeepCore, a densely-spaced sub-array of DOMs at the bottom central region of IceCube, enables the detection of atmospheric neutrinos with an energy threshold in the GeV range. The high statistics data of DeepCore provides a unique opportunity to perform neutrino oscillation studies as well as explore various sub-leading Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics signatures. We consider a well-motivated minimal extension of the Standard Model by an additional anomaly-free, gauged lepton-number symmetry, such as $L_e - L_μ$ or $L_e - L_τ$. These symmetries give rise to flavor-dependent long-range interaction mediated through a very light neutral gauge boson. In this contribution, we present the sensitivity of the IceCube DeepCore detector to search for this flavor-dependent long-range interaction potential with a runtime of 9.3 years.
