Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The Antarctic TianMu project deploys small telescopes in Antarctica to enable time-domain astronomical observations, overcoming harsh environmental challenges with a drift-scan CCD prototype that has operated successfully for two years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Antarctica's extended dark period for continuous time-domain observations and address challenges like extreme cold, autonomous operation, power, and network limitations.

Method: Developed the AT-Proto telescope using drift-scan CCD technology, deployed in Zhongshan Station, featuring wide-sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, long-term staring, and multi-band measurements.

Result: The prototype operated reliably in Antarctica for over two years, validating the technology's effectiveness for future large-scale arrays.

Conclusion: Successful operation of AT-Proto provides a strong foundation for expanding Antarctic time-domain observation arrays, proving the feasibility of the approach under harsh conditions.

Abstract: Wide-field rapid sky surveys serve as critical observational methods for time-domain astronomical research. The Antarctic region, with several months of continuous dark nights annually, is an ideal site for time-domain astronomical observations. The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Project aims to deploy a fleet of small telescopes, adopting an array observation model to conduct time-domain optical observations in Antarctica, featuring wide-sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, long-period staring, and simultaneous multi-band measurements. Considering the severe challenges optical telescopes face in Antarctica, including extremely low temperatures, unattended operation, and limited power supply and network transmission, we have designed and developed the Antarctic TianMu prototype telescope based on drift-scan charge-coupled device technology. In October 2022, our prototype (with an aperture of 18 cm), named AT-Proto was transported to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica aboard China's 39th Antarctic Research Expedition. It has since operated stably and reliably in the frigid environment for over two years, demonstrating the significant advantages of this technology in polar astronomical observations. The experimental observation results of AT-Proto provide a solid foundation for the subsequent construction of a time-domain astronomy observation array in Antarctica.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Program uses a prototype telescope in Antarctica to conduct high-cadence sky surveys. The 2023 data shows excellent performance with astrometric precision under 2 arcseconds, G-band detection limit of 15.00 mag, and photometric errors below 0.1 mag for brighter stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Antarctica's pristine observing conditions for long-term, high-cadence astronomical surveys, demonstrated through the successful deployment and data analysis of the TianMu prototype telescope.

Method: The study employs an 18-cm prototype telescope deployed at Zhongshan Station. Data processing includes four stages: preprocessing, instrumental correction, astrometric solutions, and photometry. Gaia DR3 serves as the reference catalog for validation.

Result: The telescope produced over 300,000 images. Results include reduced images and photometric catalogs with astrometric precision <2 arcseconds, G-band limit 15.00 mag, and photometric errors <0.1 mag (brighter than 14 mag), improving to <0.01 mag for stars brighter than 11-12 mag using advanced photometry methods.

Conclusion: The TianMu prototype validates the Antarctic environment's suitability for high-precision time-domain observations. The system's performance establishes its potential for future large-scale surveys in Antarctica.

Abstract: The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Program is a time-domain optical sky survey project carried out in Antarctica, capable of large sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, and long-period staring. It utilizes the exceptional observing conditions in Antarctica to conduct high-cadence time-domain sky surveys. At present, we have successfully developed an 18-cm aperture Antarctic TianMu prototype, which has been deployed at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica for two consecutive years of trouble-free observations, during which more than 300,000 original images were obtained. This paper systematically outlines the commissioning data of the prototype telescope in 2023, the primary data processing pipeline, and the preliminary data products. The core pipeline encompasses four key stages: Data preprocessing, instrumental effect correction, astrometric solution, and full-field stellar photometry. Here, we release the 2023 data products, which specifically include reduced image data and a photometric catalog, for which, preliminary analyses demonstrate robust performance. Using Gaia Data Release 3 as a reference catalog, the astrometric precision, quantified by the root mean square of positional errors, is determined to be better than approximately 2 arcseconds, validating the observational capabilities of the system. For a 30-second exposure, the detection limit in the G-band is achieved at 15.00~mag, with a detection threshold of 1.5~$σ$. The photometric errors are below 0.1~mag for the majority of stars brighter than 14.00~mag. Furthermore, it improves significantly, reaching better than 0.01~mag for most stars brighter than 11.00~mag and 12.00~mag when employing the adaptive aperture photometry and point spread function photometry methods, respectively.

Abstract: We outline a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys aimed at connecting the physics of the accretion disc and X-ray corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the properties of their nebular regions and circumgalactic medium (CGM). We focus on the non-linear Lx-Luv relation and on deviations from this canonical coupling encoded in $Δα_{OX}$, the offset of the optical-to-X-ray index from the mean relation, and propose to use broad and narrow line emission and CGM nebulae as calorimeters of the ionising SED to trace different accretion "states". We propose an observational strategy based on rest-frame UV/optical spectroscopy of $\sim 10^{4}-10^{5}$ AGN, a time-domain reverberation-mapping tier for a well-defined subsample, coordinated X-ray coverage, and wide-field IFU mapping of CGM emission (including H$α$ and Ly$α$). From these goals we derive requirements for a future ESO facility in the 2040s: a dedicated, wide-field, high-multiplex optical-NIR spectroscopic telescope with time-domain flexibility and arcmin-scale IFU capability.

Abstract: From NBODY1 to NBODY6 : The Growth of an Industry is the title of a 1999 invited review by Sverre Aarseth, for Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP). I took this as an inspiration for the title of this paper; it describes how Sverres NBODY Industry has further grown since 90s of the previous century, and how it is further flourishing and hopefully developing, in his spirit, even after the sad news of his passing away reached us. My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive.

Abstract: Women are consistently underrepresented in astrophysics yet are simultaneously subject to disproportionate attrition at every career stage. This disparity between demonstrated efficacy in job performance and ultimate career outcome was the primary motivation for the Picture an Astronomer series, which included both targeted public outreach to increase representation of women in astrophysics and high-level, solution-oriented discussions among professional astronomers. In March 2025, more than 200 astronomers came together in a hybrid-format symposium focused on the state of the field for female scientists, combining scientific exchange with discussions of policies and practices to strengthen retention of talent in the field. This white paper is the result of those discussions, offering a wide range of recommendations developed in the context of gendered attrition in astrophysics but which ultimately support a healthier climate for all scientists alike.

### [6] [Nine years of UVIT: assessing sensitivity variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24475)
*Akanksha Dagore,Prajwel Joseph,S. N. Tandon,Annapurni Subramaniam,S. K. Ghosh,C. S. Stalin*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The UVIT telescope on AstroSat, despite losing its NUV channel in 2018, has shown stable FUV sensitivity over nine years based on data from NGC 188 and HZ 4 observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if FUV sensitivity deteriorated over time due to contaminants on the optics, given its critical role in UV astronomy despite NUV channel failure.

Method: Analyzed nine years of FUV data from UVIT targeting the open cluster NGC 188 and white dwarf HZ 4 to monitor sensitivity variations.

Result: No significant sensitivity decline or episodic variations in FUV channel were detected over the observation period.

Conclusion: UVIT's FUV channel remains reliable for astronomical observations, showing no contamination-induced degradation after nine years in orbit.

Abstract: The Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is one of the five payloads onboard the first Indian multiwavelength astronomical observatory, AstroSat, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation on 28 September 2015. UVIT, designed for simultaneous imaging in the far-ultraviolet (FUV; 1300-1800 Å) and near-ultraviolet (NUV; 2000-3000 Å) channels, has completed nine years in orbit in 2024 despite the failure of the NUV channel in 2018. As the FUV optics is subject to possible reduction in sensitivity due to microscopic amounts of contaminants, we used the FUV data acquired by UVIT over the past nine years on the open cluster NGC 188 and the white dwarf HZ 4 to study sensitivity variations in the UVIT FUV channel. Our findings indicate no significant reduction in the sensitivity of the FUV channel over the last nine years, with no significant episodic variations due to unknown causes.

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the importance of studying solar flares for understanding fundamental physics and mitigating space weather impacts. It highlights UK contributions to international missions and identifies key observations and capabilities needed for future advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solar flares are critical for studying extreme physical phenomena and addressing space weather threats to technology and infrastructure. Maintaining UK leadership and meeting strategic goals requires addressing open science questions and observational needs.

Method: The paper reviews current UK involvement in international collaborations and space missions, identifies critical science questions, and outlines necessary observational and modeling capabilities for the next decade.

Result: Identifies key requirements for future missions and instruments (e.g., SPARK, EUVST, OSIRIS) and underscores the need for continued UK participation to achieve scientific and strategic objectives.

Conclusion: Continued investment in solar flare research and associated technologies is essential for advancing science and ensuring UK leadership, which aligns with national space strategy and international collaboration goals.

Abstract: Solar flares are the largest energy-release events in the Solar System, allowing us to study fundamental physical phenomena under extreme conditions. Those include magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, radiation transport, and various plasma physics processes, all of which occur throughout the heliosphere and rest of the Universe. Flares and eruptive events are also components of geo-effective space weather. Their impacts from a space weather perspective are numerous, such as harm to satellites, disruption to GPS, communications and power systems, and impacts on passenger air travel. A comprehensive understanding of solar flares is therefore not just a compelling science problem, but also important for national security and infrastructure. This white paper (WP) addresses critical open science questions related to solar flares. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK has a robust and vibrant solar flare community. We are key partners in international collaborations, and also provide instrumentation for existing and upcoming ESA/NASA/JAXA space missions. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field, achieve Solar System Advisory Panel roadmap goals, and to work under the UK Space Agency's National Space Strategy Pillars. Several complementary WPs have been submitted that discuss instruments or concepts that would directly address the observational requirements we describe (including: SPARK, solar optimised IFUs, Solar-C/EUVST, and OSIRIS), as well as required numerical modelling efforts and infrastructure.

### [8] [AstroReview: An LLM-driven Multi-Agent Framework for Telescope Proposal Peer Review and Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24754)
*Yutong Wang,Yunxiang Xiao,Yonglin Tian,Junyong Li,Jing Wang,Yisheng Lv*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: AstroReview is a open-source framework that automates the proposal review process in astronomy through three stages, achieving 87% accuracy in identifying accepted proposals and improving acceptance rates by 66% with iterative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing competition for telescope time and the burden of manual peer review necessitate automation to ensure fair, transparent, and scalable evaluation.

Method: AstroReview uses an agent-based approach with three stages: assessing novelty/merit, feasibility/yield, and meta-review/reliability. It employs task isolation and explicit reasoning to reduce errors and enhance transparency.

Result: In experiments, AstroReview accurately identifies accepted proposals at 87% accuracy (without fine-tuning) and increases acceptance rates by 66% through iterative feedback with its Proposal Authoring Agent.

Conclusion: The system offers a practical solution for scalable, auditable, and efficient proposal review, crucial for resource-limited observatories facing proposal overload.

Abstract: Competitive access to modern observatories has intensified as proposal volumes outpace available telescope time, making timely, consistent, and transparent peer review a critical bottleneck for the advancement of astronomy. Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.

Abstract: The increasing data volume of high-energy space monitors necessitates real-time, automated transient classification for multi-messenger follow-up. Conventional methods rely on empirical features like hardness ratios and reliable localization, which are not always precisely available during early detection. We developed the Lightweight Unified Neural Classifier for High-energy Transients (LUNCH) - an end-to-end deep-learning framework that performs general transient classification directly from raw multi-band light curves, eliminating the need for background subtraction or source localization. Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively. Evaluated on 15 years of Fermi/GBM triggers, the optimal model achieves 97.23% accuracy when trained on complete energy spectra. A lightweight version using only three broad energy bands retains 95.07% accuracy, demonstrating that coarse spectral information fused with temporal context enables robust discrimination. The system significantly outperforms the GBM in-flight classifier on three months of independent test data. Feature visualization reveals well-separated class clusters, confirming physical interpretability. LUNCH combines high accuracy, low computational cost, and instrument-agnostic inputs, offering a practical solution for real-time in-flight processing that enables timely triggers for immediate multi-wavelength and multi-messenger follow-up observations in future time-domain missions.

### [10] [TTC: Transformer-based TDE Classifier for the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24782)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTC, a Transformer-based classifier for detecting Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) using light curves from WFIRST. It combines a parametric fitting module and a Mgformer-based Transformer network, offering a balance between speed and accuracy. The system outperforms existing methods with high recall and precision and has successfully identified TDE candidates in real-time tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve TDE detection by reducing reliance on external catalogs and effectively processing real-time and archival data from WFIRST, especially for faint/distant galaxies.

Method: TTC uses two modules: a light curve parametric fitting module and a Mgformer Transformer network. Both modules are trained and evaluated on a ZTF dataset of 7413 classified transients. The Transformer module achieves higher performance (recall 0.79, precision 0.76) but requires parameter tuning, while the parametric module is faster (10x) but less accurate.

Result: In testing, TTC correctly identified all spectroscopically confirmed TDEs in real-time ZTF data and found ~20 candidates in WFIRST deep field data. The modular design allows trade-offs between speed, precision, and recall. Performance is superior to existing methods.

Conclusion: TTC effectively addresses TDE classification challenges, enabling efficient candidate detection in real-time and archival surveys. Future improvements with WFIRST's differential database will further enhance discovery rates.

Abstract: We propose the Transformer-based Tidal disruption events (TDE) Classifier (\texttt{TTC}), specifically designed to operate effectively with both real-time alert streams and archival data of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). It aims to minimize the reliance on external catalogs and find TDE candidates from pure light curves, which is more suitable for finding TDEs in faint and distant galaxies. \texttt{TTC} consists of two key modules that can work independently: (1) A light curve parametric fitting module and (2) a Transformer (\texttt{Mgformer})-based classification network. The training of the latter module and evaluation for each module utilize a light curve dataset of 7413 spectroscopically classified transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The \texttt{Mgformer}-based module is superior in performance and flexibility. Its representative recall and precision values are 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, and can be modified by adjusting the threshold. It can also efficiently find TDE candidates within 30 days from the first detection. For comparison, the parametric fitting module yields values of 0.72 and 0.40, respectively, while it is $>$10 times faster in average speed. Hence, the setup of modules allows a trade-off between performance and time, as well as precision and recall. \texttt{TTC} has successfully picked out all spectroscopically identified TDEs among ZTF transients in a real-time classification test, and selected $\sim$20 TDE candidates in the deep field survey data of WFST. The discovery rate will greatly increase once the differential database for the wide field survey is ready.

### [11] [Resolving the Origins and Pathways of Ionizing Radiation Escape with UV Integral Field Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24895)
*Cody Carr,Renyue Cen,Brian Fleming,Sophia Flury,Stephan McCandliss,Sally Oey,Allison Strom*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The Epoch of Reionization involves the ionization of neutral hydrogen by early galaxies, but uncertainties remain about the escape fraction of ionizing photons. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will enable studies of this process with UV instruments like an integral field spectrograph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about how ionizing photons escape galaxies, driven by stellar feedback mechanisms, and to overcome limitations of current UV instrumentation in resolution and sensitivity.

Method: Proposing the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) equipped with a UV integral field spectrograph to resolve multi-scale structures from 1-100 pc to 100 kpc, enabling observation of local galaxy analogs for high-redshift systems.

Result: The HWO will provide necessary observational capabilities to study Lyman Continuum (LyC) photon escape mechanisms, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observable signatures.

Conclusion: Future instruments on HWO are critical for advancing our understanding of reionization processes by directly observing ionizing photon escape pathways in galaxies.

Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).

*Zhuang Li*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The analysis critiques Aydiner et al.'s work on magnetically charged black holes, identifying inconsistencies in extremal charge values, Schwarzschild limit characterization, weak-deflection expansion errors, GUP tunneling probability sign mistakes, and terminology issues regarding horizonless solutions and plasma parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the findings of Aydiner et al.'s study on thermodynamics, tunneling kinetics, and weak-lensing signatures of a magnetically charged nonlinear-electrodynamics black hole by identifying and correcting critical errors.

Method: The critique examines the original paper's calculations and arguments, pointing out contradictions in extremal charge definitions, inaccuracies in Schwarzschild limit classification, failures in weak-deflection expansion to match Schwarzschild coefficients, sign errors in GUP tunneling probability, and improper terminology use.

Result: Several fundamental errors are found that undermine the original paper's conclusions, including inconsistent extremal charge values, incorrect Schwarzschild limit treatment, flawed weak-lensing analysis, and misinterpretations of plasma parameters.

Conclusion: The errors identified necessitate revisions to Aydiner et al.'s model to ensure asymptotic limits are correctly handled and terminological inaccuracies are corrected for the work's conclusions to be considered valid.

Abstract: We analyze the recent article by Aydiner, Sucu, and Sakalli [Phys.\ Dark Univ.\ \textbf{50}, 102164 (2025)] [arXiv:2507.05145], which investigates the thermodynamics, tunneling kinetics, and weak-lensing signatures of a regular, magnetically charged nonlinear-electrodynamics black hole. While the study addresses interesting phenomenological questions, we identify several inconsistencies that compromise the validity of the reported results. Specifically, we note mutually contradictory values for the extremal charge separating the black hole and horizonless regimes, an inaccurate characterization of the Schwarzschild limit as an extremal configuration, a vacuum weak-deflection expansion that fails to recover the standard second-order Schwarzschild coefficient, and a sign error in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected tunneling probability. We also highlight terminology regarding the nature of the horizonless solution and the physical interpretation of plasma parameters that requires correction. We clarify these points to ensure the robustness of the model's asymptotic limits.

### [13] [Twinkle twinkle dark star: Oscillating profiles from dark matter scalar solitons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23800)
*Nicolas Aimar,Caio F. B. Macedo,João Luís Rosa,Diego Rubiera-Garcia*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates oscillatons, time-dependent solitonic solutions of real scalar fields, exploring their observational properties such as light deflection, redshift oscillations, and accretion disk signatures, suggesting potential detectability via the Event Horizon Telescope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the observable differences between oscillatons and boson stars, and determine if oscillatons' time-dependent features can be detected in near-horizon observations of supermassive black holes like Sgr A* and M87*.

Method: Computed light deflection, redshift effects on accretion disk intensity profiles, and analyzed oscillation periods relative to Event Horizon Telescope's observational capabilities.

Result: Found that oscillatons support stable accretion disks with time-varying intensity profiles ('breathing' patterns) due to redshift oscillations; their oscillation periods are within EHT's detectability range for certain masses.

Conclusion: Oscillatons could exhibit measurable 'twinkling' effects in accretion disk observations, offering a testable prediction for distinguishing them from traditional black holes or boson stars using existing telescopic technology.

Abstract: Real scalar fields, e.g. the axion, cannot condensate into stationary solitonic configurations to form star-like structures, eventually either dispersing or collapsing. However, by relaxing the stationarity condition on the metric, it has been shown that oscillatory solitonic solutions -- known as oscillatons -- exist. Oscillatons share several properties with boson stars, including comparable compactness and mass ranges. However, their time-dependent nature can lead to potentially discriminating observable signatures. In this work, we explore the observational properties of oscillatons. We find that stable oscillatory circular orbits exist, extending down to the center of the configuration, supporting the possibility of accretion disk structures within the star. We compute the deflection of light rays and verify that it is largely insensitive to the time dependence of the metric. Despite this, the oscillatory behavior of the redshift factor has a strong effect on the observed intensity profiles from accretion disks, producing a breathing-like image whose frequency depends on the mass of the scalar field. In fact, their oscillation period may lie within the observational windows of the Event Horizon Telescope for Sgr A$^{*}$ and M87$^{*}$, suggesting the possibility that this ``twinkling" behavior could be tested via near-horizon imaging of these objects.

Abstract: A common assumption in the Effective Field Theories of gravity is that their quasi-static weak-field infrared limit yields the well-known second-order Poisson operator. We examine this limit for the universality class of parity-even, symmetric, analytic gravitational theories admitting a local derivative expansion using Lorentzian FRG methods. We find that, in the curvature-squared truncation, the scalar-trace sector self-closes at $\mathcal{O}(q^4),$ allowing the projected flow to be obtained by analytic continuation of the corresponding Euclidean result. This yields a screened d'Alambertian $D_\ell \equiv (1+\ell^2 \Box)\Box$ characterised by an emergent correlation length $\ell$. We show the operator is consistent with the ADM constraint structure and thus it does not introduce propagating scalar ghosts in the scalar-trace sector. We further derive its retarded response kernel and show its static-limit Green's function in response to a point source, which reduces to Newtonian gravity for $\ell \rightarrow 0$.

Abstract: We calculate the Feynman propagator at finite temperature in an Einstein universe for a neutral massive scalar field arbitrarily coupled to the Ricci curvature. Then, the propagator is used to determine the mean square fluctuation, the internal energy, and pressure of a scalar blackbody radiation as functions of the curvature coupling parameter $ξ$. By studying thermodynamics of massless scalar fields, we show that the only value of $ξ$ consistent with stable thermodynamic equilibrium at all temperatures and for all radii of the universe is $1/6$, i.e., corresponding to the conformal coupling. Moreover, if electromagnetic and neutrino radiations are present at the regime of high temperatures and/or large radii, we show that at least one scalar field must also be present to ensure thermodynamic stability.

Abstract: We calculate, up to the first-order in the black hole spin, the perihelion precession of a test particle in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole using the perturbative Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) vector method. To account for the dragging of inertial frames, we modify the LRL vector by incorporating a counteracting term in the angular momentum, which preserves the Keplerian orbit form to first order. We derive the standard Lense-Thirring precession result, leading to a transparent reinterpretation of known results, clarifying the role of frame dragging in LRL-based perturbation methods.

Abstract: The Unruh effect remains a central topic in quantum field theory, although its direct experimental verification continues to be challenging. Recent efforts have therefore focused on indirect detection strategies in which the Unruh effect emerges through measurable physical processes. In this work, we extend a previously introduced detector model, originally formulated for a massless scalar field, to the electromagnetic field. We show that the decoherence decay rates differ between inertial and accelerated frames. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the characteristic exponential decay associated with the Unruh effect can be observed at lower accelerations than those considered in earlier studies.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We propose a new method to detect the Unruh effect using a non-uniformly accelerated detector, showing that non-uniform motion modifies the Unruh spectrum and entanglement creates squeezed vacuum states, reducing required acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional uniform acceleration assumption limits Unruh effect studies. We aim to enable indirect detection without this restriction and explore lower-acceleration observational methods.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework for non-inertial observers with time-dependent acceleration detectors. Analyze particle distribution in non-uniform Rindler spacetime and entanglement effects on vacuum states.

Result: Time-dependent acceleration modifies the Unruh spectrum, and quantum entanglement deforms the vacuum into squeezed states, significantly lowering required acceleration for detection.

Conclusion: Non-uniform acceleration and entanglement effects provide viable pathways for observing the Unruh effect at experimentally accessible acceleration levels, advancing testable quantum field theory predictions.

Abstract: While the Unruh effect has traditionally been studied under the assumption of uniform acceleration, a simplification motivated by experimental considerations, it is not necessarily true for all non-inertial motions. We propose a novel approach for the indirect detection of the Unruh effect without relying on the former restriction. Previous studies have shown that probing the decoherence of an Unruh-DeWitt detector can significantly reduce the acceleration required for observing the effect by several orders of magnitude compared to earlier proposals. Building on this idea, we develop a theoretical framework describing a non-inertial observer equipped with a detector undergoing non-uniform, time-dependent acceleration. We show that, in a non-uniformly accelerated Rindler spacetime, the particle distribution perceived in the Minkowski vacuum acquires a time-dependent modification of the standard Unruh spectrum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum entanglement leads to a deformation of the Minkowski vacuum into squeezed states.

*Zhao Li,Shaoqi Hou,Wen Zhao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a rigorous method for calculating gravitational-wave scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole using BH perturbation theory, resolving divergences in conventional approaches and providing accurate waveforms. It compares new results with asymptotic methods and Kirchhoff integrals, showing superior performance in forward scattering and high-frequency regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unreliability of conventional asymptotic expansion methods near the optical axis in GW lensing, which suffer from divergences and fail in forward-scattering regions. The goal is to develop a robust framework for accurate modeling in strong gravitational fields.

Method: The method involves abandoning asymptotic radial expansions, placing the observer at a finite distance, and using BH perturbation theory to achieve a convergent partial-wave description without regularization. GW waveforms were reconstructed from master variables to analyze polarizations, Poisson spots, and wavefront distortions.

Result: Key results include resolving divergences, successfully capturing the Poisson spot and wavefront distortions, and showing that conventional methods only qualitatively match at large angles. The new approach also differs significantly from Kirchhoff integrals at high frequencies due to neglect of long-range effects.

Conclusion: The study establishes a stable, physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong fields, enabling precise GW lensing models beyond standard approximations. This provides a solid foundation for future studies requiring accurate modeling in extreme gravitational environments.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) scattering in strong gravitational fields is a central problem in GW lensing. Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations.

Abstract: We investigate charged Dirac quasinormal spectra on Reissner-Nordström black holes in a mirror-like cavity. For this purpose, we first derive charged Dirac equations, and \textit{two} sets of Robin boundary conditions following the vanishing energy flux principle. The Dirac spectra are then computed both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal a symmetry hidden in the Dirac spectra between two boundary conditions. Moreover, when the cavity is placed close to the event horizon $r_+$, we identify that, in the neutral background the Dirac spectra asymptote to $-(3/8+N/2)i$ [$-(1/8+N/2)i$] for the first [second] boundary condition; while in the charged background the real part of charged Dirac spectra asymptote to $qQ/r_+$ for both boundary conditions; where $N$ is the overtone number, $q$ and $Q$ are charges for the field and for the background. In particular, we uncover a striking anomalous decay pattern, $i.e.$ the excited modes decay \textit{slower} than the fundamental mode, when the charge coupling $qQ$ is large. Our results further illustrate the robustness of vanishing energy flux principle, which are applicable not only to anti-de Sitter black holes but also to black holes in a cavity.

Abstract: We investigate gravitational wave emission from periodic timelike orbits of a test particle around a loop quantum gravity-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability. Our results demonstrate that gravitational waves from periodic orbits provide a sensitive probe of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes in the strong-field regime.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces an analytical framework to study kinematic anisotropies in gravitational-wave backgrounds, correcting previous quadrupole-order results and deriving auto-correlation formulas for both infinite and finite pulsar distances, useful for future analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observed isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing arrays has spurred investigations into possible anisotropies, particularly kinematic ones caused by the observer's motion relative to the GWB's isotropic frame.

Method: Developed an analytical toolbox to model kinematic anisotropies' effects on the overlap reduction function, corrected discrepancies in quadrupole-order terms from prior work, and derived auto-correlation formulas using two methods accounting for pulsar distances.

Result: Results differ from previous studies at quadrupole order, with new auto-correlation expressions for infinite and finite pulsar distances, which can be applied in forecast models or Bayesian analysis frameworks.

Conclusion: The derived formulas provide essential tools for improving the accuracy of GWB analyses, enabling better constraints on anisotropies and underlying physical causes through upcoming studies.

Abstract: The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.

Abstract: We present a fully analytical method for calculating the key parameters of a Kerr-like gravitational shadow, including its horizontal and vertical diameters, $D_X$ and $D_Y$, the coordinates of its center $X_{C}$, the average radius $\bar{R}$, the deviation from sphericity $δC$, and the mean deviation from the Kerr shadow $δK$. Developed within the framework of perturbation theory, this approach yields all characteristic parameters as simple polynomial expressions with an accuracy of $\sim a^5$, where $a$ is the Kerr spin parameter. This eliminates the need for repeated numerical integration of cumbersome parametric equations. Furthermore, our derived formulas account for the effects of a plasma medium - a feature of particular relevance given the prospect of multi-frequency astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We propose conformal invariance as a fundamental symmetry governing cosmological particle creation from vacuum fluctuations, employing a phenomenological approach with an ideal fluid action to address the long-standing back-reaction problem. We demonstrate that particle production cannot emerge from classical vacua but must originate from a quantum vacuum at zero scale factor, with the transition surface constituting a light-like rather than space-like hypersurface. This implies that particles are created on the light cone and remain causally connected, with their apparent simultaneity being illusory. Our model requires an open Universe ($k=0, -1$) and reconceptualizes the Big Bang as a detonation wave propagating through quantum vacuum at the speed of light.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) modifies higher-derivative spin-2 theories, connecting it to Stelle's gravity, Lee-Wick partners, and dRGT massive gravity. It shows that GUP-induced terms avoid the Boulware-Deser ghost and maintain a consistent nonlinear framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instabilities in higher-derivative spin-2 theories, particularly the Boulware-Deser ghost, by exploring minimal GUP deformations and their compatibility with existing frameworks like dRGT gravity.

Method: The authors analyze GUP-deformed Fierz-Pauli actions, use auxiliary fields to recast terms as Lee-Wick partners, and integrate the helicity-0 mode into a Galileon structure. They show GUP corrections act as total derivatives, preserving stability.

Result: A unified framework connecting GUP models, Lee-Wick quantization, and curvature-squared gravity is established. The GUP deformation removes the propagating ghost while retaining a ghost-free nonlinear massive gravity completion.

Conclusion: GUP deformations provide a viable path to stabilize higher-derivative spin-2 theories, merging different approaches into a coherent structure that maintains theoretical consistency without ghost instabilities.

Abstract: We revisit the structure of higher-derivative spin-2 theories from the perspective of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We show that a minimal GUP deformation of the Fierz-Pauli (FP) action induces a higher-derivative kinetic operator equivalent, at quadratic order, to the spin-2 sector of Stelle's curvature-squared gravity. Via an auxiliary-field formulation, the GUP-generated higher derivative can be recast as a Lee-Wick (LW) partner of the spin-2. We then demonstrate that the same GUP deformation is compatible with the Galileon structure governing the helicity-0 mode in dRGT massive gravity. The GUP corrections reduce to total derivatives, preserving the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost. Our results unify GUP models, LW quantization, and curvature-squared gravity into a single framework, in which the higher-derivative spin-2 ghost is rendered non-propagating while the nonlinear massive completion remains intact.

### [26] [Black hole images as probes of thermodynamic evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24174)
*Lei You,Jinsong Yang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how black hole images, such as shadows and accretion-disk images, encode thermodynamic properties and phase transition information across different ensembles (isobaric vs. isothermal) using the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole model. It shows that image size variations reflect phase transitions and ensemble-specific temperature behaviors, offering a new method to probe black hole thermodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how black hole images can serve as observational tools for studying thermodynamic phase transitions and ensemble-dependent behaviors, extending the avenues for probing black hole properties beyond traditional methods.

Method: Analytic analysis combined with numerical verification, focusing on Reissner-Nordström-AdS black holes. The study examines image size variations under different thermodynamic ensembles (isobaric vs. isothermal) and their relationship with phase transitions and temperature changes.

Result: Phase transitions manifest as sudden image size increases in both ensembles. Isothermal evolution causes nonmonotonic image size behavior, revealing an extremal radius whose physical realization depends on temperature relative to a critical value. Only two of three possible scenarios are physically valid, showing that images encode temperature and ensemble information.

Conclusion: Black hole images are viable observational tools for thermodynamic analysis. The study introduces a new framework combining phase transitions and nonmonotonic evolution, which can be applied to other black hole systems to explore thermodynamic imprints.

Abstract: We investigate how black hole images (shadows and accretion-disk images) encode thermodynamic evolution information across different ensembles, using the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole as an illustrative example. Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature. Furthermore, image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitatively differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information. These results not only enrich the set of observational avenues for probing black hole thermodynamic properties, but also introduce a new paradigm. This paradigm studies phase transitions in conjunction with nonmonotonic evolution, providing a useful framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems.

*A. C. Khunt,K. Yavuz Ekşi,P. C. Vinodkumar*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines how pressure anisotropy affects neutron star properties using the Bowers-Liang model and a quasi-local approach. Moderate anisotropy increases maximum mass and compactness, with curvature invariants showing varied sensitivities to anisotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the influence of pressure anisotropy on neutron star structure and observables under general relativity, testing phenomenological models against observational constraints.

Method: Apply the Bowers-Liang anisotropy model with SLy equation of state; compute mass-radius relations, moment of inertia, compactness, tidal deformability, and curvature invariants (Ricci scalar, Kretschmann scalar, Weyl scalar); compare with quasi-local model results.

Result: Moderate positive anisotropy boosts maximum neutron star mass to ~2.4 solar masses and increases compactness by 20% compared to isotropic cases. Curvature measures linked to matter strongly respond to anisotropy, while Weyl curvature remains stable. Maximum compactness reaches 0.25-0.38, but high values depend on viable anisotropy mechanisms. Model comparisons reveal significant dependence on anisotropy prescriptions.

Conclusion: Pressure anisotropy significantly alters neutron star properties but results are model-dependent. Phenomenological models like BL offer insights but must be validated against realistic physics, highlighting the need for detailed anisotropy mechanisms in strong-field gravity studies.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of pressure anisotropy on the structural and geometric properties of neutron stars within general relativity, focusing primarily on the phenomenological Bowers-Liang (BL) model, and comparing selected results with a quasi-local prescription. Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\;M_\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.
  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\mathcal{C}_{\max}\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $λ_{\rm BL}\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the evaporation of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes using semiclassical methods, focusing on scalar field emissions. It identifies how loop quantum gravity effects influence remnant formation, with differing outcomes for minimal vs. non-minimal couplings (ξ), particularly noting accelerated emission for ξ=1 and remnants for ξ=-1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the end state of black hole evaporation under semiclassical frameworks, addressing how quantum gravity effects (loop quantum corrections) alter Hawking radiation dynamics, especially in different scalar field coupling scenarios.

Method: Semiclassical calculations involving minimally and non-minimally coupled massless scalar fields. Quasi-normal mode analysis was used to assess remnant stability. Parameters included coupling constants (ξ=±1) for the non-minimal case.

Result: For minimal coupling, loop effects slow emission, leading to remnant formation. For ξ=1 non-minimal coupling, emission accelerates with no remnant; ξ=-1 yields remnant similar to minimal case, confirmed by quasi-normal mode stability analysis.

Conclusion: Black hole fate depends critically on scalar field coupling type and strength. Remnant formation is possible under certain coupling conditions, suggesting loop quantum gravity impacts black hole evolution differently based on field interactions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the evaporation of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole. Within a semiclassical framework, we compute the energy emission of Hawking radiation by introducing a massless scalar field as a test field, considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled cases. For the minimally coupled case, we find that loop quantum gravity effects become crucial at the late stage of the evaporation process, causing the emission rate to slow down and eventually terminate, leading to the formation of a black hole remnant. A quasi-normal mode analysis indicates the stability of this remnant. For the non-minimally coupled case, we show that the fate of the black hole strongly depends on the value of the coupling constant $ξ$. Focusing on the cases $ξ=\pm1$, we find that for $ξ=1$, the energy emission rate accelerates at late times and no remnant is formed, whereas for $ξ=-1$, the emission rate slows down and eventually terminates, resulting in a stable black hole remnant, as supported by the corresponding quasi-normal mode analysis.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzes quadratic scalar-nonmetricity (QSN) theories by examining their degrees of freedom (DOFs) using linear cosmological perturbations and Hamiltonian constraint analysis. It identifies discrepancies in DOF counts between perturbative and non-perturbative methods, indicating strong coupling of extra modes in viable cosmological models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the viability of QSN models by rigorously quantifying their DOFs and ensuring consistency between perturbative and non-perturbative analyses while maintaining valid cosmological backgrounds and gravitational wave propagation.

Method: The authors use ADM decomposition and classify QSN models via primary constraints. They apply both linear perturbation analysis around FLRW backgrounds and Dirac-Bergmann Hamiltonian analysis to count DOFs across three cases (II, V, VI).

Result: Case II consistently shows 10 DOFs in both approaches. Cases V and VI exhibit 8 DOFs non-perturbatively but fewer (6 and 5) perturbatively, suggesting hidden modes become strongly coupled in cosmological contexts.

Conclusion: Discrepancies between perturbative and full Hamiltonian DOF counts signal the presence of strongly coupled modes in QSN theories, affecting their cosmological viability despite superficial compatibility at linear order.

Abstract: We study the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) in quadratic scalar-nonmetricity (QSN) theory, whose Lagrangian is the linear combination of five quadratic nonmetricity invariants with coefficients depending on a dynamical scalar field. Working in the coincident gauge, we perform the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and classify QSN models into distinct cases according to the numbers of their primary constraints. For cases that are physically viable in the sense that both a consistent cosmological background and tensor gravitational waves exist, we count the number of degrees of freedom based on two approaches. First we investigate the linear cosmological perturbations around an FLRW background. Then we perform a Dirac-Bergmann Hamiltonian constraint analysis to count the number of DOFs at the nonperturbative level. We focus on three representative cases. In case II, both the perturbative and nonperturbative approaches yield the same result, which indicates that the theory propagates 10 degrees of freedom. In contrast, in cases V and VI, the Hamiltonian analysis yields 8 degrees of freedom, while only 6 and 5 modes are visible at linear order in perturbations, respectively. This indicates that additional modes are strongly coupled on cosmological backgrounds.

Motivation: To understand quantum gravity effects in the black hole interior by deriving equations that account for quantum corrections to classical general relativity descriptions.

Method: Deriving gauge-invariant perturbation equations within hybrid loop quantum cosmology, applying quantum zero-mode Hamiltonian constraints on factorizable quantum states using a relational geometric variable.

Result: Obtained modified Regge-Wheeler equations with quantum geometry expectation values, characterizing quantum corrections and enabling study of gravitational wave dynamics under loop quantum gravity effects.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a viable framework for studying hybrid loop quantum gravity modifications to classical black hole interiors, opening avenues for exploring quantum effects on gravitational wave propagation.

Abstract: A set of effective equations for the gauge-invariant gravitational perturbations in the interior of a spherically symmetric, non-rotating black hole is derived within the framework of hybrid loop quantum cosmology. The quantum zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint, obtained from a perturbative gauge-invariant canonical analysis, is explicitly imposed on a class of quantum states whose wavefunctions factorize into a background and a perturbative part, related through a geometric relational variable. These states naturally describe regimes with small perturbative backreaction and lead to an effective Hamiltonian and associated dynamics for the perturbations. The resulting equations take the form of Regge-Wheeler equations modified by expectation values of the quantum black hole geometry, providing a clear characterization of quantum corrections to the classical description of the black hole interior. This framework opens the way to investigating hybrid loop quantum gravity effects in the propagation of gravitational waves.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that in the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse model, the Schwarzschild solution has the longest event horizon formation time among asymptotically flat, static, spherically-symmetric black holes with the same mass under the weak energy condition, extending black hole inequalities to a temporal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the event horizon formation time compares across black hole solutions and establish a new temporal bound similar to existing spatial inequalities like the Penrose inequality.

Method: Analyzes the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse framework, compares event horizon formation times, applies the weak energy condition, and uses variational methods to prove Schwarzschild's maximization of ΔT_eh.

Result: Proves the Schwarzschild exterior maximizes ΔT_eh = (19/6)m, setting a new upper limit for event horizon formation time in the specified class of black holes.

Conclusion: Extends black hole inequality principles to temporal dynamics, showing Schwarzschild's uniqueness in maximizing horizon formation time under given conditions.

Abstract: We prove that, in the framework of the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse, the Schwarzschild exterior maximizes the event horizon formation time $ΔT_{\text{eh}}=\frac{19}{6}m$ among all asymptotically flat, static, spherically-symmetric black holes with the same ADM mass $m$ that satisfy the weak energy condition. This bound extends the typical black hole inequalities--such as the Penrose inequality, which constrains spatial geometry--to temporal setting.

### [33] [Difference between quark stars and neutron stars in universal relations and their effect on gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24703)
*Duanyuan Gao,Hao-Jui Kuan,Yurui Zhou,Zhiqiang Miao,Yong Gao,Chen Zhang,Enping Zhou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines $f$-mode frequencies and tidal overlaps of quark stars through general relativity, finding their distinct tidal deformability-$f$-mode relations compared to neutron stars. This difference affects dynamical tides, which could theoretically distinguish quark from neutron stars via gravitational waves, though the effect is undetectable even by next-gen detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify universal relations of neutron stars against quark stars and explore parameter dependencies in quark equations of state. Assess if dynamical tide effects from their structural differences can be observationally distinguished via gravitational wave measurements during inspiral phases.

Method: Full general relativity calculations for quark star $f$-mode frequencies and tidal overlaps. Parameter exploration of quark star equations of state. Post-Newtonian method applied to calculate tidal dephasing from dynamical tide effects.

Result: Quark stars show significantly smaller radii in low mass regimes, leading to distinct tidal deformability-$f$-mode frequency-radius relations vs neutron stars. The resulting dynamical tide effects produce tidal dephasing undetectable even by next-generation gravitational wave detectors.

Conclusion: While structural differences between quark and neutron stars produce unique dynamical tide signatures, current and upcoming gravitational wave detectors lack sensitivity to detect these effects. Future observational studies require more sensitive instrumentation.

Abstract: We calculate the $f$-mode frequency and tidal overlap of quark stars using the full general relativity method. We verify the universal relations obtained from conventional neutron stars in the case of quark stars and explore the cases with different values of parameters of the quark star equation of state. Since quark stars have significantly smaller radii compared to neutron stars in the low mass range, the relation between the tidal defomability and $f$-mode frequency times radius is different for neutron stars and quark stars. This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase. We calculate the tidal dephasing caused by this effect in the post-Newtonian method and find that it can not be detected even by the next-generation gravitational wave detectors.

Abstract: We analyze the influence of gravitational waves on a Sagnac interferometer formed by the interference of two counter-propagating beams traversing a closed spatial loop. In addition to the well-known Sagnac phase shift, we identify an additional contribution originating from a relative rotation in the polarization vectors. We formulate this effect as a gravitational holonomy associated to the internal Lorentz group. The magnitude of both effects is computed due to gravitational waves generated by a localized source far from the detector, at leading order in the inverse distance. For freely falling observers, the phase shift is zero and the polarization rotation becomes the dominant effect.

Abstract: Gravitational wave echoes offer a unique probe of the near-horizon structure of astrophysical black holes, beyond the standard ''black hole spectroscopy''. Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.

Abstract: We study Higgs-like inflation in the framework of scalar-torsion gravity, focusing on the general class of $f(T,φ)$ theories in which gravitation is mediated by torsion rather than curvature. Motivated by the increasing precision of cosmic microwave background and large-scale-structure observations, we examine whether Higgs-like inflation remains compatible with current data in this extended gravitational setting. Working within the slow-roll approximation, we analyze the inflationary dynamics both analytically and numerically. In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,φ)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures.

Abstract: In this study we obtain interior solutions and investigate structural properties of isotropic compact stars in the framework of four-dimensional regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the five-dimensional Proca star under gravity with the infinite tower of higher curvature corrections. We find that when the coupling constant exceeds a critical value, solutions with a frequency approaching zero appear. In the finite-order corrections case $n=2$ (Gauss-Bonnet gravity), the matter field and energy density diverge near the origin as $ω\to 0$. In contrast, for $n\geq 3$, the divergence is efficiently suppressed, both the field and the energy density remain finite everywhere, and both the matter field and energy density remain finite everywhere. In the limit $ω\to 0$, a class of horizonless frozen star solutions emerges, which are referred to ``frozen stars". Importantly, frozen stars contain neither curvature singularities nor event horizons. These frozen stars develop a critical horizon at a finite radius $r_c$, where $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ approach zero. The frozen star is indistinguishable from that of an extremal black hole outside $r_c$, and its compactness can reach the extremal black hole value.

Abstract: With an intent to examine the combined effect of non-linear electrodynamics (NED) and dark matter (DM), we obtain a static and spherically symmetric solution with the black hole (BH) magnetically charged and immersed in the Hernquist DM halo (MHDM). The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $α$, $β$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring. Interestingly, we find combinations of charge and halo parameters that leave the deflection angle unchanged from the Schwarzschild case, thereby leading to a situation where an MHDM BH and a Schwarzschild BH become indistinguishable. Similar results are also observed for lensing observables. Finally, utilizing observations related to the angular diameter of super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ and employing the $χ^2$ test, we extract bounds on $g$, $α$, and $β$ signifying the viability of our BH model as an SMBH.

Abstract: We investigate the oscillation of the Kasner exponent $p_t$ near critical point of the hairy black holes dual to holographic superfluid and reveal a clear inverse periodicity $f(T_c/(T_c-T))$ in a large region below the critical temperature. We first introduce the fourth-power term with a coefficient $λ$ to adjust the oscillatory behavior of the Kasner exponent $p_t$ near the critical point. Importantly, we show that the nonlinear coefficient $λ$ provides accurate control of this periodicity: a positive $λ$ stretches the region, while a negative $λ$ compresses it. By contrast, the influence of another coefficient $τ$ is more concentrated in regions away from the critical point. This work provides a new perspective for understanding the complex dynamical structure inside black holes and extends the actively control from the fourth- and sixth-power term into the black hole interior region.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The absence of Birkhoff's theorem in effective quantum gravity models leads to a fundamental ambiguity in the vacuum sector, where a priori no unique vacuum solution exists. As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework.

Abstract: We investigate the strong gravitational lensing and shadow properties of the black hole in the context of bumblebee gravity, characterized by a global monopole charge $κη^2$ and a Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $γ$. We compute the deflection angles of light passing near the black hole in strong deflection limit, and estimate key lensing observables, including relativistic Einstein rings, absolute magnifications, image separations, and flux ratios, for astrophysical black holes. The black hole shadow is analyzed using the apparent angular size $θ_{\rm Shadow} = 2\,θ_{\infty}$ in the limiting photon orbit. Furthermore, we study the modification of the shadow structure in the presence of a radially infalling, optically thin accretion flow within a generalized framework. Our results indicate that both the global monopole charge and Lorentz-violating parameters significantly influence the photon sphere, lensing observables, and shadow morphology, potentially providing observational signatures for testing bumblebee gravity in the strong-field regime.

*Despina Totolou,Theodoros Papanikolaou,Emmanuel N. Saridakis*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation in Horndeski gravity, showing that cubic Horndeski interactions can create a transient ultra-slow-roll phase during inflation. This amplifies small-scale curvature perturbations, generating asteroid-mass PBHs that could constitute up to 90% of dark matter while complying with observational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate non-particle dark matter candidates like PBHs within modified gravity frameworks, specifically Horndeski theories, which avoid GW170817 constraints and naturally produce required density fluctuations without potential features.

Method: Analyzing inflationary dynamics with cubic Horndeski interaction under constraints of constant Ricci coupling and GW170817-compliant gravitational wave speed. Modeled inflaton with canonical kinetic term and smooth potential to show kinetic-dependent enhancement of friction causing ultra-slow-roll phase.

Result: Generated prominent peaks in scalar power spectrum leading to asteroid-mass PBHs (~1e-16 solar masses) forming up to 90% of dark matter. Predicted sharp spectral features potentially observable as scalar-induced gravitational waves.

Conclusion: Horndeski gravity provides a viable mechanism for PBH dark matter without requiring potential features, offering a testable model through gravitational wave signatures while satisfying existing observational limits.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,M_\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\rm PBH}\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.

Motivation: To connect low-energy observables (EFT coefficients) with high-energy UV theory requirements like causality and unitarity, ensuring consistency between particle physics and cosmological observations.

Method: Uses scattering amplitudes to derive positivity bounds on EFT parameters, applying them to a simplified dark energy model for phenomenological analysis against observational data.

Result: Demonstrates how UV-driven positivity constraints limit possible EFT coefficients, offering insights into dark energy models consistent with both theoretical principles and recent cosmological measurements.

Conclusion: Positivity bounds provide a bridge between fundamental UV principles and low-energy phenomenology, offering a powerful tool to constrain dark energy models and guide interpretations of cosmological observations.

Abstract: This talk gives a short introduction to the ``UV/EFT correspondence", which uses scattering amplitudes to relate the Effective Field Theory (EFT) coefficients probed by low-energy measurements to properties of the underlying high-energy (UV) completion. This includes recent ``positivity bounds" on EFT coefficients, which are the low-energy signatures of causality and unitarity in the UV. To illustrate their phenomenological impact, I apply these bounds to a simple EFT for dark energy and compare with recent cosmological observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the systematic uncertainties in numerical simulations of post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scenarios, which are crucial for accurate axion abundance predictions.

Method: Develops a new analytical framework based on two-particle-irreducible effective action and Fokker-Planck equations to model the dynamics of domain wall networks, incorporating thermal, plasma-induced, and quantum effects.

Result: Presents preliminary results from this framework, highlighting its potential to improve cosmological axion abundance estimates for both QCD axions and high-mass axion-like particles.

Conclusion: Advances the theoretical tools needed to reduce uncertainties in axion production models, offering a viable alternative to traditional numerical approaches while emphasizing the importance of considering multi-scale effects.

Abstract: The post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scenario provides a rich theoretical framework to study axion dark matter production through the dynamics oftopological defects. Accurate predictions for the axion abundance require a detailed understanding of the formation and evolution of cosmic strings and domain walls, which are inevitably produced in this scenario. Most existing studies rely on large-scale numerical simulations of the classical equations of motion, which are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. In this contribution, we briefly review the main features of the post-inflationary scenario and the current limitations in the literature, and present preliminary results from a new analytical framework for axion domain wall networks. Our approach is based on nonequilibrium quantum field theory. It employs the two-particle-irreducible effective action to derive effective Fokker-Planck equations for macroscopic quantities such as the average energy density and root-mean-square velocity of the network.We discuss the relevance of thermal, self-interactions, plasma-induced and quantum effects for cosmological axion abundance estimates, with applications to QCD axions and high-mass axion-like particles.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a mechanism where non-annihilating dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions accumulates inside Population III (Pop III) stars, leading to early formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds. These seeds can grow sufficiently to explain the observed high-redshift SMBHs, with testable predictions for direct detection experiments and gravitational wave observatories like LISA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of SMBHs at z>5 by JWST challenges existing BH formation theories. Existing models struggle to produce sufficiently massive BHs in early宇宙. This work aims to provide a plausible mechanism to explain their existence.

Method: Examines non-annihilating DM with spin-dependent interactions with protons. Models DM accumulation in Pop III stars to trigger premature BH formation. Analyzes parameter spaces compatible with observed SMBH mass function and stellar mass relations.

Result: Identifies viable DM parameter regions explaining high-redshift SMBHs. Predicts testable DM signals for future experiments (e.g., direct detection) and gravitational wave signatures detectable by LISA/PTA.

Conclusion: Non-annihilating DM interactions offer a pathway to early BH seed formation, resolving the timescale problem of SMBH growth. Observable predictions in GW and DM detection experiments validate this scenario.

Abstract: The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts ($z>5$), as revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), challenges standard black hole (BH) formation scenarios. We propose a mechanism in which non-annihilating dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model (SM) particles accumulates inside Population III (Pop III) stars, inducing their premature collapse into BH seeds having the same mass as the parent star. Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments. The scenario may lead to distinctive gravitational wave (GW) signatures from SMBH mergers, accessible to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing array (PTA) observations.

It evaluates systematic uncertainties, introduces 'data-clustering safety' criteria, and reports α_s(M_Z)=0.1183±0.0023 (68% CL) with weak PDF form correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an updated α_s determination using NNLO calculations, a sensitive nucleon dataset, and a self-consistent QCD framework. Also, to rigorously assess uncertainties and correlations affecting α_s extraction.

Method: Global QCD analysis CT25 combining LHC Run-2 data and  extensive kinematic ranges. Evaluated uncertainty estimates using dynamic tolerance, Bayesian models, and introduced 'data-clustering safety' criteria. Checked α_s correlation with PDF parametrization forms.

Result: Determined α_s(M_Z)=0.1183⁺₀.₀023₋₀.₀020 at 68% CL, identified variability in uncertainty methods, confirmed weak PDF correlation.

Conclusion: The CT25 analysis provides a robust α_s value. Uncertainty assessment protocols like data-clustering safety improve reliability. Cross-method consistency validates results despite challenges in systematic uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: We present a new determination of the strong coupling constant $α_s$ from a global QCD analysis CT25 of parton distribution functions (PDFs) that incorporates high-precision experimental measurements from the Run-2 of the Large Hadron Collider together with a large sample of other measurements over a wide interval of energies. This work addresses two objectives: providing an up-to-date determination of $α_s$ using NNLO calculations and a sensitive nucleon data set within a self-consistent framework, and critically assessing the robustness of the $α_s(M_Z)$ extraction in light of systematic uncertainties as well as correlations of $α_s(M_Z)$ with the functional forms of PDFs and other model parameters. In regard to the uncertainty assessment, we demonstrate that some commonly used criteria, including the dynamical tolerance and Bayesian hierarchical models, may produce significantly different or even unstable estimates for the net $α_s$ uncertainty, and we introduce a concept of \textit{data-clustering safety} that the replicable uncertainty estimates must satisfy. Based on this in-depth examination of the CT25 global hadronic data set using a combination of analysis methods, and after demonstrating a weak correlation between $α_s$ and the functional forms of CT25 PDF parametrizations, we find $α_s(M_Z)=0.1183^{+0.0023}_{-0.0020}$ at the 68\% credibility level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges in incorporating bound-state formation effects into dark matter annihilation studies, which previously required expensive numerical computations and hindered large-scale parameter scans.

Method: Developed BSFfast—a lightweight tool with precomputed cross-section tables, leveraging rescaling relations and interpolation routines in multiple languages (Mathematica, Python, C) to handle a wide range of models including excited states and radiative transitions.

Result: BSFfast successfully reduces computational burden, demonstrated through a superWIMP scenario with a colored mediator, showing it can perform analyses that were previously too resource-intensive.

Conclusion: BSFfast facilitates more efficient and practical dark matter phenomenology studies by providing accessible, precomputed data and flexible interpolation tools, now publicly available for broader use.

Abstract: Bound-state formation (BSF) can have a large impact on annihilation of new physics particles with long-range interactions in the early Universe. In particular, the inclusion of excited bound states has been found to strongly reduce the dark matter abundance and qualitatively modify the associated freeze-out dynamics. While these effects can be captured by an effective annihilation cross section, its explicit computation is numerically expensive and therefore impractical for repeated use in Boltzmann solvers or parameter scans. In this work we present BSFfast, a lightweight numerical tool that provides precomputed, tabulated effective BSF cross sections for a wide class of phenomenologically relevant models, including highly excited bound states and, where applicable, the full network of radiative bound-to-bound transitions. We exploit rescaling relations of the cross section to efficiently cover models with additional free parameters and provide fast interpolation routines in Mathematica, python and C for use in Boltzmann solvers. As an illustration, we apply BSFfast to a superWIMP scenario with a colored mediator, demonstrating that the tool enables phenomenological studies that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.

TL;DR: The study examines how charm quarks evolve in hot quark-gluon plasma using a quasiparticle model with dynamical quark flavors, finding systematic suppression of charm production and conservation of charm quark number.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of charm quarks in hot QCD matter and validate theoretical models against experimental data, particularly focusing on their production rates and abundance conservation.

Method: A quasiparticle model incorporating $N_f=2+1(+1)$ quark flavors is used to simulate charm quark dynamics in expanding thermal media. Rate equations solve for time-dependent abundance under perfect fluid and viscous conditions.

Result: Charm production rate decreases monotonically across all medium formulations. In N_f=2+1+1 scenarios, production suppression occurs due to heavy quasiparticle mass effects. Charm quark number remains conserved, aligning with experiments.

Conclusion: The model successfully reproduces experimental observations of charm quark conservation, validating the quasiparticle approach for describing heavy quark dynamics in QCD plasmas under diverse expansion conditions.

Abstract: We study the evolution of charm $(c)$ quarks in hot QCD matter with $N_f=2+1(+1)$ quark flavors by analyzing the charm production rate and the time dependence of their abundance. Microscopically, the system is described within a quasiparticle model, in which interactions among dynamical quarks and gluons are encoded in their effective masses with the running coupling constrained by lattice QCD data. We investigate $c$-quark kinetics in a longitudinally propagating perfect fluid as well as in a viscous medium undergoing (2+1)D expansion, and find that the charm production rate decreases monotonically across all medium formulations. In the $N_f=2+1+1$ scenario, charm production is systematically suppressed due to the effective mass of heavy quasiparticles. Assuming an initial charm yield given by the Statistical Hadronization Model, we solve the rate equation and compute the total charm abundance in hot QCD medium. For all descriptions considered, the charm quark number remains approximately conserved, consistent with existing experimental evidence.

Abstract: In this article we explore ideas from quantum entanglement which can be meaningfully formulated and tested in the collider environment. We propose Bell-type inequalities as operator-level diagnostics of quantum incompatibility in particle-physics systems. We construct flavor operators associated with mass identification, flavor change, and charged-current weak mixing which arise from fundamental interactions in the Standard Model. We treat these interactions as alternative measurement settings in a Gendanken experiment. For entangled two-particle states, these operators generate nontrivial correlations that violate Bell-type bounds, excluding non-contextual local descriptions under the stated assumptions. These violations arise from the algebraic structure of the operators rather than from kinematic correlations or exotic dynamics. We discuss how the predicted correlation patterns may be probed with experimental data, clarifying the scope and limitations of Bell-type reasoning in particle physics.

Abstract: Clarifying the origin of hadron mass is one of the fundamental problems in particle physics, relevant from hadronic scales to astrophysical observations. At low energies, this issue is reflected in the decomposition of the hadron mass into chiral-variant and -invariant components. In this letter, we propose a method to extract the chiral invariant mass from the gravitational $D$-form factor under the assumption of the lightest-sigma meson dominance. Focusing on the nucleon, we show that a sizable chiral invariant mass is required to reproduce lattice QCD data, consistent with neutron star constraints.

Abstract: Motivated by the cosmological collider program, which aims to probe high-energy physics through inflation, we investigate the phase diagram of multi-flavor QCD in de Sitter spacetime with a flavor-universal axial chemical potential induced by a rolling inflaton coupled to fermions. We determine the first-order critical line and a critical point as functions of the Hubble parameter and the axial chemical potential, employing an effective description of chiral symmetry breaking within the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We find that a first-order chiral phase transition may occur during inflation or at its end when the axial chemical potential is sufficiently large and crosses the critical line. This provides a cosmological collider analogue of the QCD phase diagram explored in heavy-ion colliders.

*Suresh Chand,Avnish,Poulose Poulose*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework for low-scale leptogenesis by extending the Standard Model with singlet right-handed neutrinos, a charged singlet fermion, and a real scalar. It introduces a mechanism where CP asymmetry arises from both two-body decays and 2→2 scattering processes, involving interactions between visible and dark sectors. The model unifies matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter abundance explanations, with CP violation enhanced by dark-sector interactions and predictions for detectable dark particles at the LHC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in low-scale leptogenesis by incorporating a dark sector that enriches CP-violation sources and provides a unified explanation for matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter abundance.

Method: The model extends the SM with three singlet right-handed neutrinos, a charged singlet fermion, and a real scalar. CP asymmetry arises from: 1) two-body decays of the lightest right-handed neutrino into lepton/Higgs or dark particles, and 2) multiple scattering processes involving visible and dark states. CP-violating phases come from conventional vertex corrections and novel dark-sector interference effects.

Result: The model establishes a direct link between the dark sector and leptogenesis, enhancing CP violation in neutrino interactions. It predicts dark-sector particles detectable at the LHC and offers a unified solution for baryogenesis and dark matter.

Conclusion: This framework successfully connects dark matter and leptogenesis through novel CP-violation mechanisms, offering testable predictions at colliders and addressing observational constraints on dark matter abundance and matter-antimatter asymmetry.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for low-scale leptogenesis within an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes three SU(2) singlet right-handed neutrinos, a singlet charged neutral fermion, and a real scalar field. In this setup, the CP asymmetry arises through a rich interplay of mechanisms, including two-body decays of the lightest right-handed neutrino into leptons and Higgs or into dark-sector particles, as well as multiple 2 -> 2 scattering processes involving visible and dark states. Crucially, the CP-violating phases originate not only from conventional vertex and self-energy corrections but also from novel interference effects mediated by the dark sector, which significantly enrich the sources of asymmetry. A distinctive feature of our model is the direct connection between the dark sector and leptogenesis, providing a unified explanation for both the matter-antimatter asymmetry and DM abundance. This connection leads to enhanced CP violation in neutrino interactions and predicts new dark-sector particles accessible at the LHC.

TL;DR: The paper explores how time-dependent magnetic fields affect the quantum states of charmonia through avoided level crossings, using a multi-channel Landau-Zener model. It finds that nonadiabatic effects like Landau-Zener transitions and Stückelberg interference significantly impact occupation probabilities, offering guidance for lattice simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the real-time dynamics of hadrons in magnetic fields, particularly focusing on how time-dependent fields influence state transitions via avoided crossings, which is crucial for interpreting experimental and simulation data.

Method: A multi-channel Landau-Zener Hamiltonian is constructed using the static magnetic-field charmonia spectrum. Time evolution is analyzed under various magnetic-field profiles (linear ramps, Gaussian decays/pulses) to compute occupation probabilities across different sweep rates and initial conditions.

Result: Nonadiabatic processes dominate occupation probabilities, with Landau-Zener transitions and Stückelberg interference playing key roles. Different magnetic-field profiles (single/double passage) lead to distinct probability behaviors, providing insights for future lattice studies.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of considering nonadiabatic dynamics in magnetic field-induced transitions of charmonia. Results guide experimental design and lattice simulations, emphasizing the need to account for interference effects and field-profile dependencies in hadron dynamics.

Abstract: The mass spectrum of hadrons in magnetic fields features avoided level-crossing structures arising from the mixing of spin eigenstates. In this work, we investigate the impact of level-crossing dynamics of charmonia subjected to time-dependent magnetic fields, where we particularly focus on the occupation probabilities of two or more states as they undergo transitions at avoided crossings. Using a static spectrum of charmonia in magnetic fields, we construct a multi-channel Landau-Zener Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we analyze the time evolution under several representative magnetic-field profiles, including linear ramps and Gaussian decays corresponding to single-passage dynamics, as well as Gaussian pulses realizing double-passage dynamics, and compute the occupation probabilities over a wide range of sweep rates and initial conditions. Our results show that nonadiabatic dynamics, including Landau-Zener transitions and Stückelberg interference, strongly influences the occupation probabilities of charmonia. These findings provide new insights into the real-time dynamics of magnetized hadrons and offer useful guidance for future lattice simulation studies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) play a central role in describing experimental data at colliders and provide insight into the structure of nucleons. As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community.

### [57] [An $A_4$-Symmetric Double Seesaw for Neutrino Masses and Mixing in Light of JUNO results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24132)
*Swaraj Kumar Nanda,Maibam Ricky Devi,Chandini Dash,R. N. Panda,Sudhanwa Patra*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a double seesaw mechanism combined with an A4 discrete symmetry to generate light neutrino masses. This framework predicts a tribimaximal mixing (TBM) structure with a (1-3) sector correction, incorporates recent JUNO data on solar and reactor mixing angles, and restricts model parameters, offering testable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the generation of light neutrino masses and mixing angles within an extended Standard Model, incorporating symmetry-based flavor structures that align with experimental data.

Method: A double seesaw mechanism with right-handed neutrinos and sterile fermions, guided by A4 symmetry to produce predictive mass matrices. Analytic expressions derived for neutrino eigenvalues and their hierarchy. JUNO measurements on sin²θ12 and sin²θ13 are used to constrain model parameters.

Result: The model yields a TBM structure corrected by a (1-3) rotation, links observed mixing angles to symmetry-breaking phases and rotation magnitudes, and narrows allowable parameter space via JUNO constraints. Clarifies the symmetry's role in mass hierarchy.

Conclusion: The combination of double seesaw, A4 symmetry, and JUNO data creates a predictive framework for neutrino properties, providing a coherent mass generation explanation and testable predictions for future experiments.

Abstract: We discuss a double seesaw mechanism for generating light neutrino masses within the Standard Model extensions that include both right-handed neutrinos and extra gauge-singlet sterile fermions. The flavour structure of the double seesaw framework is invoked by an $A_4$ discrete symmetry which yields predictive textures for the Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$, the mixing matrix $M_{RS}$ connecting right-handed and sterile neutrinos, and the bare Majorana mass matrix $M_S$ for the sterile neutrinos. The interesting feature of the present framework is that the combination of the double seesaw mechanism and $A_4$ flavour alignments yields a leading-order TBM structure, corrected by a single rotation in the (1-3) sector. We also derive analytic expressions for the heavy sterile eigenvalues and for the resulting light neutrino masses, thereby clarifying the role of the symmetry in shaping the neutrino mass hierarchy. We further incorporate the most recent JUNO measurements, which improve the precision of the solar mixing angle $\sin^2θ_{12} \simeq 0.31$, along with updated constraints on $\sin^2θ_{13}$. We show that these results significantly restrict the allowed parameter space of the model. In particular, the observed value of $\sin^2θ_{12}$ constrains the magnitude of the (1--3) rotation and the phases associated with the $A_4$ flavon couplings, while the value of $\sin^2θ_{13}$ sharpens these restrictions further. Overall, the interplay between double seesaw dynamics, $A_4$ flavour symmetry, and the recent JUNO constraints yields a highly predictive framework for neutrino masses and mixings, offering a coherent explanation for the generation of light neutrino masses and testable predictions for future experiments.

Result: Non-diagonal elements related to initial/final leptons are found to be the most influential parameters affecting LFV signatures.

Conclusion: The MRSSMSeesaw's LFV sensitivity is strongly tied to specific parameter configurations, offering a testable prediction for future experiments.

Abstract: The Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model with Seesaw (MRSSMSeesaw) extends the MRSSM by incorporating right-handed neutrinos to generate neutrino masses via the Type-I seesaw mechanism. This work presents a detailed analysis of lepton flavor violation (LFV) processes, including $\ell_i \rightarrow \ell_j γ$, $\ell_i \rightarrow 3\ell_j$, and Higgs decays $h \rightarrow \ell_i \ell_j$, Based on the current experimental limitations, we carry out detailed parameter scanning and numerical calculations to analyse the effects of different sensitive parameters on LFV.The numerical results show that the non-diagonal elements involving the initial and final leptons are main sensitive parameters and LFV sources.

Main category: hep-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of astrophysical background particles on dark matter annihilation rates and their role in explaining observational anomalies like the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess.

Method: A two-component DM model with fermionic χ and pseudoscalar φ is analyzed. The study calculates background-enhanced forces via loop-level interactions, leading to Sommerfeld enhancement in χ annihilation cross-sections.

Result: The model's parameter space shows viability in explaining the gamma-ray excess, with background effects amplifying Sommerfeld enhancement and expanding applicable parameter regions.

Conclusion: Background-induced forces significantly affect DM annihilation rates, necessitating their consideration in indirect detection studies to accurately interpret astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We study the impact of background-induced forces on dark matter (DM) annihilation and their implications for indirect detection. In the presence of a finite number density of background particles, loop-level interactions can generate an effective force that is significantly enhanced relative to the vacuum case. We construct a two-component DM model in which the dominant component is a fermionic particle $χ$ and the subdominant component is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle $φ$. The annihilation of $χ$ proceeds through the p-wave channel and produces gamma-ray emission. The finite density of $φ$ particles induces a background-enhanced force between $χ$ particles, leading to a sizable Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation. We show that a viable region of parameter space in this model can account for the gamma-ray excess observed in the Galactic Center using Fermi-LAT data. The background-induced force substantially amplifies the Sommerfeld enhancement and thus enlarges the parameter space capable of explaining the excess, highlighting the importance of background effects in astrophysical environments.

Abstract: We investigate a Standard Model extension containing $n$ degenerate down-type isosinglet vector-like quarks (VLQs) with masses $M_{\mathcal D}$ and Yukawa couplings $y_{\mathcal D}$, supplemented by a single right-handed neutrino (RHN), aiming to simultaneously address neutrino mass generation, electroweak vacuum stability, and Higgs inflation. The VLQs play the dominant role in stabilizing the Higgs potential through their impact on the renormalization-group evolution, while the RHN generates light neutrino masses via a Type-I seesaw mechanism and smooths the high-scale running of the Higgs quartic coupling in the inflationary regime. We perform a two-loop Standard Model renormalization-group equation analysis supplemented by the one-loop contributions of the VLQs and the RHN, with proper matching across their mass thresholds. Using these RG trajectories, we identify the regions in $(n,\, y_{\mathcal D},\, M_{\mathcal D})$ that stabilize the Higgs potential up to the Planck scale while satisfying experimental constraints. Employing the RG-improved Higgs potential in the metric formulation of non-minimal Higgs inflation, we compute the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$. The SM+$(n)$VLQ+RHN framework yields predictions consistent with the combined Planck, WMAP, and BICEP/Keck data, while simultaneously ensuring electroweak vacuum stability and phenomenologically viable neutrino masses within well-defined regions of parameter space. For comparison, we also investigate the SM+$(n)$VLQ limit and present its vacuum stability and Higgs inflation predictions as a reference to quantify the stabilizing role of the VLQ sector.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, numerous exotic hadron states have been discovered, yet their underlying nature remains unclear. It is widely acknowledged that understanding hadron-hadron interactions is essential to unraveling their properties. Hadron spectroscopy is a powerful tool for this endeavor, providing rich experimental data that can shed light on exotic systems. Recently, the LHCb experiment analyzed the process $B^{-} \rightarrow J/ψΛ\bar{p}$ and observed a narrow peak in the $J/ψΛ$ invariant mass spectrum, regarding it as a candidate for a pentaquark. In this work, we extract the coupled-channel $J / ψΛ-\bar{D} Ξ_c-\bar{D}_s Λ_c$ potential based on the $J/ψΛ$ invariant mass spectrum. Our results indicate the existence of a bound state below the $\bar{D} Ξ_c$ mass threshold, corresponding to the experimentally measured state $P_{cs}(4338)$. Furthermore, we predict the scattering lengths and momentum correlation functions for the $J/ψΛ$ and $\bar{D}Ξ_c$ channels, which serve as theoretical references for future femtoscopy experiments.

TL;DR: The paper presents a model to reproduce the differential mass distribution of the D*π system in specific B meson decays, focusing on the D₁(2420) resonance.

Motivation: The motivation is to explain the dominant D₁(2420) signal observed in LHCb data, resolve discrepancies in D*π scattering length values, and provide a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of B meson decays involving final-state strong interactions.

Method: The method involves a coupled-channel meson-meson interaction model, incorporating weak decay hadronization and previous amplitude calculations for strong interactions. The model predicts the D*π invariant mass distribution and scattering length, comparing with experimental data.

Result: The model successfully reproduces the LHCb invariant mass distributions for the first time. It determines the D*π scattering length, contributing to resolving controversies by providing a consistent theoretical value.

Conclusion: The study validates the model's capability in describing B decay dynamics and D₁(2420) properties. It emphasizes the importance of final-state interactions and offers a basis for future investigations into the nature of D₁(2420).

Abstract: We present a model calculation to reproduce the differential mass distribution for the $D^*π$ system in the reactions $B^- \to D^{*+} π^- π^-$ and $B^{+}\to D_s^+D^{*-}π^{+}$ analyzed by the LHCb Collaboration, which shows a dominant signal for $D_1(2420)$. %\textbf{We} (The idea is to) We consider a model based on coupled channel meson-meson interactions that can describe the properties of $D_1(2420)$ in terms of the underlying dynamics, use it to determine the invariant mass distribution of the $D^*π$ system, and compare the results with the experimental data. We also determine the $D^*π$ scattering length, for which different values are available from different sources, leading to a controversy. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to reproduce the mentioned data using model calculations. Our formalism relies on the hadronization of different mesons through a weak decay, allowing for the final-state (strong) interactions among the relevant constituents. We benefit from our previous work when obtaining the amplitudes corresponding to the strong interactions. We hope that our findings can be useful in further investigations of the properties of $D_1(2420)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higgsinos in the MSSM with compressed spectra (Δm^0 ≲ 1 GeV) result in long-lived neutralinos that evade LHC detectors, necessitating alternative detection methods like FASER2.

Method: Analyzing scenarios where Higgsino parameters satisfy |μ| ≪ |M₁, M₂| and M₁·M₂ < 0, simulating FASER2's ability to detect long-lived neutralinos via their decay products.

Result: FASER2 can probe neutral Higgsino masses up to ~130 GeV with mass splittings between 4-30 MeV, filling gaps in existing LHC searches for Higgsinos with small mass differences.

Conclusion: FASER2 provides complementary sensitivity to Higgsinos in compressed mass regions where other LHC experiments are insensitive, enhancing prospects for dark matter and SUSY detection.

Abstract: In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), compressed Higgsinos spectrum ($Δm^0 \lesssim 1$ GeV) occurs when $|μ| \ll |M_1|, |M_2|$ and ${\rm sign}(M_1\cdot M_2)<0$, which leads to a long-lived next-to-lightest neutralino. Such a long-lived neutralino could be copiously produced at the LHC, however escape the detection at the LHC main detectors. We examine the discovery potential at the FASER experiment and find that the FASER 2 could cover the neutral Higgsino mass up to about 130 GeV with mass splitting between 4 to 30 MeV. It is complementary to both the LHC Higgsino search in the $Δm^{0,\pm} \gtrsim 1$ GeV region, and displaced vertex and disappearing track searches of charginos with $Δm^\pm \lesssim 1$ GeV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD calculations for color-singlet production in hadron collisions by extending the CoLoRFulNNLO subtraction scheme.

Method: Exploits momentum mappings in the CoLoRFulNNLO scheme to write integrated subtraction terms as parametric integrals solvable with standard tools, and expresses the result as a convolution of the Born cross section with an insertion operator.

Result: Successful analytic integration of subtraction terms, demonstrating a convolution structure compatible with NNLO computations.

Conclusion: The method provides a systematic way to handle subtraction terms, advancing the practical application of NNLO QCD predictions for color-singlet processes.

Abstract: We present the analytic integration of the iterated single unresolved subtraction terms in the extension of the CoLoRFulNNLO subtraction scheme to color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We exploit the fact that, in this scheme, subtraction terms are defined through momentum mappings which lead to exact phase space convolutions for real emissions. This allows us to write the integrated subtraction terms as parametric integrals, which can be evaluated using standard tools. Finally, we show that the integrated iterated single unresolved approximate cross section can be written as a convolution of the Born cross section with an appropriately defined insertion operator.

Motivation: To understand the inner structure of observed single-bottom strange baryons by investigating their strong decay properties through theoretical models.

Method: Systematic study of Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka allowed strong decays of 1P and 2S-wave Ξ_b/Ξ_b' baryons using the j-j coupling scheme in the quark pair creation model, with chiral quark model predictions for comparison.

Result: Identified specific 1P-wave λ-mode and ρ-mode states as candidates for observed Ξ_b(6087), Ξ_b(6095/6100), and Ξ_b(6227). Predicted decay widths and dominant channels for various states, noting narrower widths for 2S-wave states.

Conclusion: Theoretical models successfully predict candidate states and decay behaviors, suggesting experimental verification for unobserved states and further refining baryon structure understanding.

Abstract: To shed light on the inner structure of the observed single-bottom strange baryons, in this work we systematically study the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka allowed strong decay properties of $1P$- and $2S$-wave $Ξ_b$ and $Ξ_b'$ baryons within the $j-j$ coupling scheme in the framework of the quark pair creation model. For a comparison, we also give the predictions of the chiral quark model. The calculations indicate that: (i) The $1P$-wave $λ$-mode $Ξ_b$ states $Ξ_b|J^P=1/2^-,1\rangle_λ$ and $Ξ_b|J^P=3/2^-,1\rangle_λ$ are highly promising candidates for the observed state $Ξ_b(6087)$ and $Ξ_b(6095)/Ξ_b(6100)$, respectively. The $1P$-wave $ρ$-mode $Ξ_b$ states $Ξ_b|J^P=3/2^-,2\rangle_ρ$ and $Ξ_b|J^P=5/2^-,2\rangle_ρ$ are likely candidates for the state $Ξ_b(6227)$. Meanwhile, we cannot rule out the possibility that $Ξ_b(6227)$ could be a candidate of the $1P$-wave $λ$-mode $Ξ_b'$ state $Ξ_b'|J^P=3/2^-,2\rangle_λ$ or $Ξ_b'|J^P=5/2^-,2\rangle_λ$. (ii) For the other $1P$-wave $ρ$-mode $Ξ_b$ states and $1P$-wave $λ$-mode $Ξ_b'$ states, they may be moderate states with a width of several tens of MeV. Their main decay channels are $Ξ_bπ$, $Ξ_b'π$, $Ξ_b^*π$ or $Λ_b\bar{K}$. The width of the $1P$-wave $ρ$-mode $Ξ_b'$ states are slightly broader, approximately several tens to over one hundred MeV, and the dominant decay channels are $Ξ_b'π$, $Ξ_b^*π$, $Σ_bK$ or $Σ_b^*K$. (iii) The $2S$-wave $λ$-mode $Ξ_b$ and $Ξ_b'$ states are most likely to be relatively narrow state with a width of only a few to around ten MeV, and they mainly decay into $Ξ_b'π$ or $Ξ_b^*π$. In addition, the $2S$-wave $λ$-mode $Ξ_b'$ states may also mainly decay into the $1P$-wave $Ξ_b$ baryon via the pionic decay processes.

### [67] [Aspects of Sommerfeld Enhancement in the light of Halo gamma-ray excess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24662)
*Yongsoo Jho,Jeonghwan Park,Min Gi Park,Seong Chan Park*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates Sommerfeld enhancement in dark matter annihilation as an explanation for a gamma-ray excess near 20 GeV. A light CP-even scalar mediator model aligns with thermal freeze-out, the excess, and dwarf galaxy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Sommerfeld enhancement can account for the observed gamma-ray excess and reconcile it with astrophysical constraints.

Method: A minimal model using a light CP-even scalar mediator is analyzed to study velocity-dependent annihilation cross sections and their implications on dark matter annihilation signals.

Result: The model successfully explains the 20 GeV gamma-ray excess while satisfying thermal relic abundance and dwarf spheroidal galaxy upper limits.

Conclusion: Sommerfeld enhancement via a light scalar mediator provides a viable framework for interpreting the gamma-ray signal as dark matter annihilation.

Abstract: We examine Sommerfeld enhancement in dark matter annihilation as a potential origin of the halo-like gamma-ray excess near $E_γ\simeq 20$ GeV reported by Totani. A minimal model with a light CP-even scalar mediator naturally produces a velocity-dependent annihilation cross section consistent with thermal freeze-out, the Milky Way excess, and limits from dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

*Sheng-Qi Zhang,Cong-Feng Qiao*

Main category: hep-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The experimental discovery of tetraquarks and pentaquarks has driven the search for hexaquarks. Recent experiments suggest the existence of near-threshold p̄p bound states, prompting a systematic analysis of baryoniums within QCD sum rules to validate their nature and properties.

Method: The QCD sum rule framework is applied to study baryonium states, detailing their calculation procedures, including operator construction, spectral function analysis, Borel transformation, and continuum subtraction. Results are benchmarked against other models and experimental data from collaborations like BESIII.

Result: Theoretical predictions from QCD sum rules align with recent experimental observations of near-threshold baryonium states, offering insights into their binding mechanisms and internal structures. Comparisons highlight consistency with other models where possible.

Conclusion: QCD sum rules effectively describe baryonium states as hexaquark candidates, supporting their existence and providing a robust theoretical tool for future hadron physics studies. Continued experimental validation is encouraged to refine these models.

Abstract: Following the experimental confirmation of tetraquark and pentaquark states, the search for hexaquark states has emerged as a new frontier in hadron physics. Recent experimental progress, particularly by the BESIII collaboration, has provided compelling evidence for the existence of near-threshold $p\bar{p}$ bound states. These baryon-antibaryon systems, commonly referred to as baryoniums, are regarded as promising hexaquark candidates. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the investigations into baryonium states and their constituents, i.e., baryons, within the framework of QCD sum rules. We delineate the fundamental calculation procedures of this method to facilitate its practical application and benchmark the theoretical predictions against alternative models as well as the latest experimental data.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an extension to the Standard Model using S₃ modular symmetry, constructing lepton sectors with two right-handed neutrinos at specific fixed points to achieve economical models without flavons, favoring inverted neutrino mass ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a minimal framework beyond the Standard Model that explains lepton mixing patterns and neutrino masses without introducing extra flavon fields, relying instead on modular symmetries and residual symmetries at specific fixed points.

Method: The authors use Γ₂ ≃ S₃ modular symmetry, consider lepton sectors with two right-handed neutrinos, utilize non-holomorphic modular forms (S₃ representations), assign specific transformation properties to fermions, and analyze residual symmetries at τ = i∞ and τ = i to construct models without flavons.

Result: Economical models are constructed with predictive Yukawa textures. All models strongly prefer inverted neutrino mass ordering, providing testable predictions for future experiments.

Conclusion: Modular symmetry with S₃ at specific fixed points offers a viable and economical approach to lepton sector model building, avoiding flavons, and consistently predicting inverted neutrino mass hierarchy, highlighting its potential in beyond Standard Model physics.

Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model with $Γ_2\simeq S_3$ modular flavor symmetry is presented. We consider the construction of the lepton sector, augmented by two right-handed neutrino states, in the vicinity of the fixed points $τ= i\infty $ and $τ= i$. Due to the residual symmetries at these points, and with the aid of non-holomorphic modular forms (which constitute representations of $S_3$) and by assigning specific transformation properties to the fermion fields, highly economical models (without flavon fields) are constructed with interesting Yukawa textures. All presented models strongly prefer the inverted ordering for the neutrino masses.

Abstract: The dark sector may possess a rich structure yet to be uncovered, and a QCD-like dark sector with GeV-scale dark hadrons can yield novel signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we focus on a light singlet pseudoscalar mediator that connects the QCD-like dark sector to the Standard Model (SM) sector via the Higgs portal. Notably, when the lightest unstable dark meson has a mass of approximately $3$ GeV, it predominantly decays into a pair of gluons and behaves as a long-lived particle, a scenario that has received relatively little attention. We consider various Higgs production channels at the LHC and investigate two processes for generating dark mesons: (1) the cascade decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of light pseudoscalar mediators, which subsequently decay into four dark mesons; and (2) the dark shower and hadronization process whereby the Higgs boson decays into a pair of dark quarks that subsequently evolve into dark mesons. These processes give rise to novel gluon-rich dark jets composed of long-lived dark mesons. Notably, we find that appropriate trigger selection constitutes a crucial factor for detecting these signal signatures in both tracker system and CMS muon system. At the high-luminosity LHC, the exotic Higgs branching ratio to cascade decays (dark showers) can be constrained below $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-1})$ [$\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-2})$] for dark meson proper lifetimes $cτ$ ranging from $1$ mm to $100$ m.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that hadronic multiplicity in deep inelastic scattering is associated with an entanglement entropy. However, such definitions are intrinsically longitudinal and do not capture the full phase--space structure of the proton. In this work, we investigate the Wehrl entropy of the proton constructed from Husimi distribution obtained from the Gaussian smearing of the Wigner distribution. We show that the entanglement entropy naturally emerges from the normalization condition of the Husimi distribution within this framework. In addition, the Wehrl entropy contains a contribution associated with transverse degrees of freedom. Numerical results for the proton Wehrl entropy are presented for different values of the virtuality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The observation of resonant di-Higgs production, which would strongly suggest the existence of a new heavy neutral scalar $H$, has been searched for extensively at the LHC. In the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) with $m_H\gg m_h$, where $h$ is the Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV observed at the LHC, we show that a direct correlation between Br$(H\to hh)$ and Br$(H\to VV)$, with $V=Z,W$, emerges that depends only on $m_H$ (and $m_V$). In particular, for heavy scalar masses between 500\,GeV and 1\,TeV, we find that Br($H\to hh$)/ Br($H\to ZZ)\approx 9.5$. The origin of this prediction is most transparent in the Higgs basis, where the term in the scalar potential proportional to $\mathcal H_1^\dagger \mathcal H_1 \mathcal H_1^\dagger \mathcal H_2$ (and its hermitian conjugate) generates the leading contributions to the $Hhh$ and $Hhhh$ couplings in the decoupling limit of the 2HDM. Moreover, the latter coupling governs the resonant prompt tri-Higgs production via $H\to hhh$, which is also directly correlated to $H\to hh$ and $(H\to VV)$, and can yield rates large enough to be measured at the High-Luminosity LHC.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms. The $SU(2)_R$-breaking scalar $H_3$ can induce lepton flavor violating (LFV) effects in the minimal version of LRSM at the 1-loop order, originating from the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos. If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\ell_β\to \ell_α+ X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\times10^9$ GeV. In the future, the $v_R$ scale can be probed up to $5\times10^9$ GeV in high-precision muon experiments, and further up to $6\times10^{11}$ GeV by supernova observations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We analyze the mass spectra of hadrons and demonstrate that the physical spectra of mesons and baryons are well described by the exponential spectrum of open strings. The open string spectrum, derived from string theory, is characterized by a unique Hagedorn temperature $T_{\rm H}$ and free from any other parameters. Notably, our fitting to the physical spectra yields consistent values for both mesons and baryons, $T_{\rm H} \simeq 0.34\,\text{GeV}$, which contrasts with previous phenomenological analyses that suggested different values. This obtained value aligns well with typical string tension derived from lattice-QCD calculations and the Regge slope. In the baryonic sector, our results indicate that diquarks play a crucial role in describing the mass spectrum, implying that baryons can be understood as a quark-diquark system, as anticipated by Regge phenomenology. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of quark deconfinement, especially in the possibly existing regime at high temperature and small baryon chemical potential within the QCD phase diagram.

Abstract: We calculate the in-medium valence quark distribution of the pion immersed in a finite baryon density using the light-cone quark model. The medium-modified pion properties are obtained by using the constituent quark mass-dependent light cone wave functions. To obtain the constituent quark masses at finite baryon density, we employ the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We primarily focus on the in-medium electromagnetic form factor, distribution amplitude, and the parton distribution function of the pion. The parton distribution functions are also evolved from the model scale to a perturbative scale using next to leading order Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations. Furthermore, our calculated form factors are compared with available experimental measurements and lattice quantum chromodynamics studies. We also examine the Mellin moments derived from our parton distribution functions in comparison with existing extractions and theoretical model predictions.

Abstract: We develop a universal seesaw version of the Pati-Salam model wherein quarks and leptons of each family are unified into common multiplets transforming as $ψ_L(2,1,4))+ ψ_R((1,2,4)$ under the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times SU(4)_c$ gauge symmetry. Parity symmetry is spontaneously broken in the model, which helps in solving the strong CP problem without the axion. The Higgs sector of the model is very simple, consisting of a single pair of $H_L(2,1,4)+ H_R(1,2,4)$ fields. Fermion masses arise through mixing of the chiral fermions with vector-like quarks and leptons contained in $(1,1,15)$ as well as $(1,1,10)_L+(1,1,10)_R$ multiplets via a universal seesaw mechanism. Consistency of such a spectrum with the observed quark and lepton masses is established. The parity solution to the strong CP problem is shown to be effective in this framework, although there are new loop contributions to $\overlineθ$, compared to the analogous left-right symmetric model, arising from color sextet and octet fermions, as well as from diagrams mediated by leptoquark bosons. We also find that, in this setup, although lepton number is broken, neutrino masses remain zero at the tree-level. Small and finite Majorana neutrino masses are induced via one-loop diagrams, which we analyze and show to be compatible with oscillation experiments.

Abstract: We develop a general effective field theory (EFT) framework for neutrino-dark matter (DM) interactions, and apply it to systematically find all possible gauge-invariant ultraviolet (UV) completions at a given EFT operator dimension. Our goal here is to find simple UV-complete models that can realize potentially large neutrino-DM interactions, while being consistent with all existing theoretical and experimental constraints. We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrino-DM scattering in a low-energy effective theory with neutrinos and DM (DM-LEFT), together with its gauge-invariant embedding in the Standard Model EFT (DM-SMEFT). We then construct all renormalizable tree-level UV completions that generate the relevant DM-SMEFT operators up to dimension-8 using a topology-based classification. Using this framework, we present minimal UV-complete models for different DM types that can yield effective neutrino-DM couplings up to several orders of magnitude larger than the Fermi coupling, while satisfying all constraints, most notably from neutrino mass and from the charged-lepton sector. This includes a pseudo-Dirac fermion DM realization in the scotogenic neutrino mass model and models of Majorana DM inspired by type-II and inverse seesaw-based neutrino mass models. Phenomenological implications for DM thermal relic abundance and direct detection prospects, as well as various cosmological and laboratory constraints on the model parameter space, are also analyzed.

### [78] [Machine-Learning Classification of Neutron-Star Matter Composition from Macroscopic and Oscillation Observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23758)
*Wasif Husain*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning approach to classify the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star interiors using a multilayer perceptron trained on astrophysical observables. It achieves 97.4% accuracy using features like mass, radius, f-mode frequency, and damping time, showing oscillation properties are key discriminators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's uncertainty in the microscopic composition of neutron stars, and traditional methods like TOV modeling have limitations. Machine learning offers a new way to directly identify EOS patterns from observable data, aiding in distinguishing between nucleonic, strange, dark matter admixed, and hyperonic matter.

Method: A supervised learning framework is built with a labeled dataset containing neutron star configurations across four EOS families. Seven features (mass, radius, f-mode frequency, quadrupole moment, redshift, damping time, characteristic strain) are used to train a multilayer perceptron for EOS classification.

Result: The classifier achieves 97.4% accuracy on test data, with oscillation-related features (f-mode frequency and damping time) being the most important. Some misclassifications happen where EOS families have similar observables, highlighting physical overlap regions.

Conclusion: Lightweight neural networks can reliably identify EOS characteristics from limited observables, providing a baseline for future studies incorporating observational data from missions like NICER and gravitational wave analyses.

Abstract: The microscopic composition of neutron star interiors remains uncertain, with possible scenarios including nucleonic matter, hyperonic matter, dark matter admixed cores, and strange self-bound matter. Traditional constraints on the equation of state rely on Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff modelling and comparison with multimessenger observations, but machine learning provides a complementary pathway by learning composition dependent patterns directly from astrophysically accessible observables. This work presents a compact supervised learning framework for EOS family classification using stellar properties derived from TOV modelling, asteroseismology, and gravitational wave descriptors. A labelled dataset of neutron star configurations spanning four EOS families (nucleonic, strange matter, dark matter admixed, and hyperonic) is constructed using seven input features: gravitational mass, radius, fundamental f mode frequency, quadrupole moment, redshift, damping time, and characteristic strain. A multilayer perceptron is trained to infer the underlying matter composition. On a held out test set, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent with strong class wise precision and recall. Permutation based feature importance analysis shows that oscillation related quantities, especially the f mode frequency and damping time, dominate the discriminatory power, while mass and radius provide secondary support. Residual misclassifications occur in physically intuitive regions where different EOS families produce partially overlapping macroscopic signatures. These results show that lightweight neural models can reliably identify EOS family fingerprints from a modest set of observables, providing a reproducible baseline for future extensions incorporating Bayesian uncertainty and observational posteriors from NICER and gravitational wave events.

Abstract: We present the main results obtained from the COmpact BInary Pulsar search in the low-LAtitude NEighborhood (COBIPLANE), an optical photometric survey designed to find new `spider' binary millisecond pulsars. We conducted observations targeting 30 unidentified sources from the 4FGL-DR3 Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) catalog, selected for their pulsar-like $γ$-ray properties. Extending to Galactic latitudes as low as $\pm3^{\circ}$, this survey reaches closer to the Galactic plane than its predecessor survey, the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch (COBIPULSE). We report the discovery of five optical variables coincident with the localizations of 4FGL J0821.5-1436, 4FGL J1517.9-5233, 4FGL J1639.3-5146, 4FGL J1748.8-3915, and 4FGL J2056.4+3142. These systems show optical flux modulation at the presumed orbital periods of $0.41576(6) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.305(2) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.204(7) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.3(2) \ \mathrm{d}$, and $0.4395(1) \ \mathrm{d}$, respectively, and photometric temperatures of $4000$--$6000 \ \mathrm{K}$, consistent with the companion stars of `redback' subtype of spider pulsar binaries. Based on their optical light curve shapes and X-ray properties characteristic for spider systems -- namely, a luminosity of $1.5 \times 10^{32} \ (D / 3.9 \ \mathrm{kpc})^2 \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($0.3$--$10 \ \mathrm{keV}$) for 4FGL J1748.8-3915, and upper limits of $\sim10^{31}$--$10^{33} \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($0.2$--$12 \ \mathrm{keV}$) for the others -- we classify these sources as new spider candidate systems.

Abstract: Dynamics of stellar orbits in dense stellar systems and nuclear star clusters (NSC) with an embedded supermassive black hole (SMBH) is governed a complex interplay of different forces. In particular, star--star gravitational collisions (relaxation), physical collisions between stars, and the hydrodynamical interaction with any surrounding gaseous environment, such as an accretion disk. These processes influence the stellar distribution, the feeding of the central black hole, and the generation of observable phenomena. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the accretion medium modulates the long-term evolution, adding significant complexity to the system's dynamics. By employing elementary arguments we outline the mentioned influences in their mutual competition.

Abstract: We present Green's function solutions for a geometrically thin, one-dimensional Keplerian accretion disk that includes angular momentum extraction and mass loss due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. The disk viscosity is assumed to vary radially as $ν\propto r^{n}$. We derive solutions for three types of boundary conditions applied at the inner radius $r_{\rm in}$: (i) zero torque, (ii) zero mass accretion rate, and (iii) finite torque and finite accretion rate, and investigate the time evolution of a disk with an initial surface density represented by a Dirac-delta function. The mass accretion rate at the inner radius decays with time as $t^{-3/2}$ for $n = 1$ at late times in the absence of winds under the zero-torque condition, consistent with Lynden-Bell \& Pringle (1974), while the presence of winds leads to a steeper decay. All boundary conditions yield identical asymptotic time evolution for the accretion and wind mass-loss rates, though their radial profiles differ near $r_{\rm in}$. Applying our solutions to protoplanetary disks, we find that the disk follows distinct evolutionary tracks in the accretion rate-disk mass plane depending on $ψ$, a dimensionless parameter that regulates the strength of the vertical stress driving the wind, with the disk lifetime decreasing as $ψ$ increases due to enhanced wind-driven mass loss. The inner boundary condition influences the evolution for $ψ< 1$ but becomes negligible at higher $ψ$, indicating that strong magnetically driven winds dominate and limit mass inflow near the boundary. Our Green's function solutions offer a general framework to study the long-term evolution of accretion disks with magnetically driven winds.

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, mostly millisecond-duration transients of extragalactic origin whose emission mechanisms remain unknown. As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines how key parameters like magnetization σ₀ influence the broadband spectrum of synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) in the ICMART model for GRBs, showing a positive Y-σ₀ correlation and successful application to GRB 221009A.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how parameters such as magnetization (σ₀) affect the spectral energy distribution in the ICMART model, particularly in generating observable high-energy emission features, and to contrast it with internal shock models.

Method: The method involves simulating SSC spectra within the ICMART framework, analyzing the impact of σ₀ on electron distributions and magnetic fields. Key parameters tracked included the synchrotron peak energy (E_p), low-energy spectral index (α), SSC peak energy (E_ssc), and flux ratio Y between components.

Result: Results show a positive correlation between Y and σ₀, with harder synchrotron spectra (α ~ -1) linked to higher Y and stronger Klein-Nishina suppression. The model successfully reproduces MeV-TeV observations for GRB 221009A with σ₀ ≤ 20.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes that the ICMART model's parameter dependencies differ from internal shock models and demonstrates that MeV-TeV observations are crucial for understanding GRB emission mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $σ_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $α$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $α\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $σ_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $σ_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations. This study underscores the value of combined MeV-TeV observations in probing GRB emission mechanisms.

Motivation: To understand the long-term spectral variability in Mrk~1040's accretion processes, including the evolution of the soft excess and the impact of ionized absorption, and to constrain black hole parameters using a consistent analytical framework.

Method: Multi-epoch X-ray spectral and timing analysis from 2009-2024, modeling of soft excess in 2009 as a warm corona (parameters: electron temperature, radial extent), investigation of ionized absorption, Fe Kα line variations, and use of TCAF model for mass estimation.

Result: Soft excess exists in 2009 but not later; correlations between soft/hard X-ray fluxes imply common origin in a transitioning multi-layered corona. Variations in N_H reflect clumpy dynamic absorber. Derived BH mass consistent with prior estimates (~4.5e7 solar masses).

Conclusion: Observed spectral transitions and absorption changes are tied to accretion flow dynamics and coronal evolution. The multi-layered corona model provides a framework for interpreting AGN spectral variability over decadal timescales, emphasizing the role of evolving coronae and absorbers in AGN activity.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive long-term, multi-epoch spectral and timing study of the Seyfert 1 Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Mrk~1040, utilizing X-ray observations spanning from 2009 to 2024 ($\sim$15 years). The source exhibits pronounced spectral and temporal variability, indicative of transitions between different accretion regimes in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. The earlier reported soft excess is re-examined within a uniform, physically motivated multi-epoch framework. We confirm the presence of this soft excess in the 2009 observation, where it is well described by a warm, extended Comptonizing corona with $kT_{\rm e,warm} \sim 0.26$~keV and a radial extent of $R_{\rm warm} \sim 30~r_g$. In subsequent epochs, the soft excess is not statistically significant, possibly due to a combination of enhanced ionized absorption, intrinsic weakening of the warm Comptonizing region, or partial truncation of the inner disc. A strong correlation between the soft and hard X-ray fluxes suggests a common physical origin for both components, likely within a multi-layered Comptonizing structure that evolved into a compact and thermally stable corona after 2013. The observed spectral variability, together with changes in the Fe~K$α$ line strength, reflects the evolving coronal geometry and accretion flow dynamics. Variations in the intrinsic column density ($N_H$) further indicate that Mrk~1040 is embedded within a clumpy, dynamically variable absorber responding to changes in the accretion rate. Using the TCAF model, we estimate the black hole mass as $M_{\rm BH} = (4.50 \pm 1.62) \times 10^7~M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates.

### [85] [A Seyfert galaxy as a hidden counterpart to a neutrino-associated blazar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24178)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: New NuSTAR observations show that blazar PKS 1424+240 in an IceCube neutrino hotspot is much fainter in hard X-rays than expected. However, nearby Seyfert NGC 5610 has 10x higher X-ray flux. Allocating neutrino flux proportionally to X-ray emission aligns both with the X-ray-neutrino correlation, suggesting hotspots may be blends of multiple AGN and supporting hadronic origin of neutrinos via cascade reprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unexpected faintness of PKS 1424+240 in hard X-rays compared to the previously suggested X-ray-neutrino correlation prompted the study. The discovery of NGC 5610's higher X-ray flux within the same hotspot motivated re-evaluating the correlation by considering multiple AGN contributions.

Method: Analyzed new NuSTAR hard X-ray data of PKS 1424+240 and NGC 5610 coincident with IceCube neutrino hotspot. Compared observed X-ray fluxes to neutrino emissions, apportioning IceCube's local neutrino flux between the two AGN proportionally to their X-ray outputs.

Result: When splitting the neutrino flux between PKS 1424+240 and NGC 5610 according to their X-ray brightness, both now align with the proposed X-ray-neutrino correlation, resolving the earlier discrepancy.

Conclusion: IceCube hotspots likely contain unresolved blends of multiple AGN. The correlation between neutrinos and hard X-rays implies shared hadronic origins, with X-rays generated via cascade reprocessing, reinforcing the multimessenger connection between these emissions.

Abstract: The origin and production mechanisms of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain open questions in multimessenger astronomy. Previous studies have hinted at a possible linear correlation between the hard X-ray and high-energy neutrino emission in active galactic nuclei. New \textit{NuSTAR} observations, first presented here, reveal that blazar PKS 1424+240, located within a prominent IceCube neutrino hotspot, is far fainter in hard X-rays than expected from this trend. Motivated by this apparent ambiguity, we identify the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 5610, also coincident with the hotspot, whose unabsorbed hard X-ray flux exceeds that of PKS 1424+240 by about an order of magnitude. When the local IceCube neutrino flux is apportioned between the two AGN in proportion to their hard X-ray emission, both align with the previously suggested X-ray-neutrino correlation. This suggests that certain IceCube hotspots may be unresolved blends of multiple AGN, and supports a multimessenger scenario in which high-energy neutrinos and hard X-rays originate from the same hadronic interactions, with the X-ray emission produced through cascade reprocessing.

TL;DR: The analysis of SN 2020rea using TARDIS shows a transition from layered to homogeneous ejecta compositions, challenging pure deflagration models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the spectral evolution of Type Iax SN 2020rea and test the validity of pure deflagration models which predict fully mixed ejecta.

Method: Using the 1D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code TARDIS to model the spectral evolution from -7 days to +21 days post-maximum light, examining velocity-dependent abundance stratification and ejecta composition changes.

Result: Best-fit models show early layered abundances evolving into more homogeneous compositions, contradicting pure deflagration predictions of fully mixed ejecta.

Conclusion: Current pure deflagration models cannot fully explain Type Iax SNe like SN 2020rea, necessitating further research into alternative explosion mechanisms.

Abstract: Using the 1D Monte Carlo-based radiative transfer code TARDIS, we investigate the spectral evolution of the Type Iax supernova (SN) 2020rea from -7 days before to +21 days after maximum light. Our best-fit models indicate stratified, velocity-dependent abundances at early times, successfully reproducing most observed spectral features. As the SN evolves, the ejecta transition from a layered to a more homogeneous composition, posing an alternative to pure deflagration models that predict fully mixed ejecta. These results highlight the need for further investigation, as current pure deflagration models cannot fully explain the origin or spectral properties of Type Iax SNe like SN 2020rea.

### [87] [H.E.S.S. detection and multi-wavelength study of the $z \sim$ 1 blazar PKS 0346$-$27](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24228)
*H. E. S. S. collaboration*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: H.E.S.S. observed the high-redshift blazar PKS 0346-27 during a flare, detecting it at VHE for the first time above z~1. Both leptonic and hadronic models were considered, with the latter showing better consistency but requiring extreme jet parameters. This extends the VHE blazar redshift record and provides insights into EBL and jet physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the redshift range of VHE-detected blazars beyond z~1, aiding understanding of their cosmological evolution and the EBL. It also tests jet models under extreme conditions.

Method: H.E.S.S. ToO observations combined with multi-wavelength data (Fermi-LAT, Swift, ATOM). A single-zone leptonic vs. hadronic model fitting was performed to the simultaneous SED during the detection night.

Result: Detection at 6.3σ on November 3, 2021, with no intra-night variability. A Fermi-LAT flare preceded it by 2 days. Hadronic models fit better but require jet power超过 Eddington limit. Leptonic models needed extreme Lorentz factors (>80).

Conclusion: PKS 0346-27 pushes the high-redshift limit for VHE blazars, highlighting the role of hadronic processes but leaving room for multi-zone models. Results constrain EBL properties and jet energetics at extreme redshifts.

Abstract: PKS 0346-27 is a Low Synchrotron Peaked (LSP) blazar at redshift 0.991. The very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) spectra of blazars are always affected by $γγ$ absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) and subsequently, no blazars have been detected in VHE $γ$-rays at redshifts exceeding 1. Extending the redshift range of VHE-detected blazars to $z \gtrsim 1$ will yield insights into the cosmological evolution of both the VHE blazar population and the EBL. This is the goal of a target-of-opportunity (ToO) programme by H.E.S.S. to observe flaring high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 1$) blazars. We report on H.E.S.S. ToO and multi-wavelength observations of the blazar PKS\,0346$-$27. Along with H.E.S.S., simultaneous data from {\it Fermi}-LAT, {\it Swift} (XRT and UVOT), and ATOM have been analysed and modelled using single-zone leptonic and hadronic models. PKS~0346-27 has been detected by H.E.S.S at a significance of 6.3$σ$ during one night, on 3 November 2021, while for other nights before and after this day, upper limits on the VHE flux are determined. No evidence for intra-night $γ$-ray variability has been found. A flare in high-energy (HE, $E > 100$~MeV) $γ$-rays detected by {\it Fermi}-LAT preceded the H.E.S.S. detection by 2 days. A fit with a single-zone emission model to the contemporaneous spectral energy distribution during the detection night was possible with a proton-synchrotron-dominated hadronic model, requiring a proton-kinetic-energy-dominated jet power temporarily exceeding the source's Eddington limit, although alternative (e.g. multi-zone) models can not be ruled out. A one-zone leptonic model is, in principle, also able to fit the flare-state SED, however, requiring implausible parameter choices, in particular, extreme Doppler and bulk Lorentz factors of $\gtrsim 80$.

*J. H. Gillanders,A. Flors,R. Ferreira da Silva*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses improved atomic line lists for lanthanides to model the kilonova AT 2017gfo's spectrum, finding a much lower lanthanide mass fraction than previous estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address historical limitations in atomic data and improve line identification studies for r-process elements in kilonovae.

Method: Applied updated lanthanide line lists with radiative transfer tool TARDIS to model the 3.4-day X-shooter spectrum of AT 2017gfo.

Result: The model requires a lanthanide mass fraction (Xₗₙ ≈ 2.5×10⁻³), 20 times lower than prior studies, due to more accurate line contributions.

Conclusion: Future models must use advanced atomic data and prioritize completing datasets for remaining r-process elements.

Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the kilonova AT 2017gfo provide a unique opportunity to identify signatures from individual heavy elements freshly synthesised via the {\it r}-process, the nucleosynthetic channel responsible for producing $\sim$half of all trans-iron-group elements. Limitations in the available atomic data have historically hampered comprehensive line identification studies; however, renewed interest has led to the generation of improved (more complete and accurately calibrated) line lists for {\it r}-process species. Here we demonstrate the utility of such data, by exploiting newly generated line lists for the lanthanides to model the photospheric-phase 3.4d X-shooter spectrum of AT 2017gfo with the radiative transfer tool \textsc{tardis}. We find the data can only be reproduced by invoking a substantially diminished lanthanide mass fraction ($X_{\textsc{ln}}$) than that proposed by previous studies. Specifically, our model necessitates $X_{\textsc{ln}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$, a value $20 \times$ lower than previously claimed. This substantial reduction in $X_{\textsc{ln}}$ is driven by our inclusion of much more complete lanthanide line information that enables better estimation of their total contribution to the observations. We encourage future modelling works to exploit all atomic data advances, and also encourage continued efforts to generate the necessary data for the remaining {\it r}-process species of interest.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($Γ_{\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($σ_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($η$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $Γ_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+σ_0 \sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($η\gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($σ_{\rm ph}\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the $ν\barν$ annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how astrophysical observations from NICER and GW data constrain the matter properties at high densities, with a primary focus on the recent PSR J0614-3329 data. We have constructed three distinct classes of an ensemble of agnostic equation of state by speed of sound parametrisation. Bayesian inference is then employed to constrain the EoS construction parameters-namely, the squared speed of sound and chemical potential at each interpolation segment-using the observational data. Both the NICER and GW constraints hint towards a smoother EoS where PT occurs late, significantly reducing the maximum mass of NS. Also, the maximum-mass and maximum-compact sequences are distinctly different, as the former allows for the maximally stiff EoS to maximise the star mass. In contrast, the latter prefers a softer low-density and stiffer high-density EoS to maximise the compactness. The Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the observational bounds are effective in significantly constraining the low-density region of the equation of state. It is also seen that the astrophysical bound prefers the phase transition in the intermediate-density range and also prefers a small density jump for a discontinuous equation of state.

### [91] [Searching for Periodicity in FRB 20240114A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24936)
*J. I. Katz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of FRB 20240114A's 11,553 bursts, including 3,196 in a single day, showed no significant periodicity signal predicted by magnetar models. Despite the high burst count and short observation span (15,628 seconds), no periodicity was detected, even though simulations indicate a detectable amplitude of 0.15 would have been observed. This challenges magnetar model predictions requiring periodic activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test magnetar models of FRBs by searching for periodicity in the highly active FRB 20240114A, which provides a rare opportunity due to its burst frequency.

Method: Observed 11,553 bursts (including 3,196 on MJD 60381) over a 15,628-second period. Analyzed periodograms for periodicity peaks. Simulated artificial modulation to assess detection thresholds.

Result: No significant periodicity detected in the burst data. Simulations confirm that an amplitude of 0.15 would have been robustly detected if present.

Conclusion: The absence of observed periodicity challenges magnetar models predicting periodic activity in FRBs. Further study is needed to reconcile these findings with theoretical expectations.

Abstract: FRB 20240114A is extraordinarily active, and therefore presents an opportunity to search for the periodicity predicted by magnetar models of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB). Zhang, et al. (2025) observed 11,553 bursts, including 3196 on MJD 60381 (March 12, 2024). We find no significant peak in the periodogram of those bursts, which occur within 15628 s, short enough that even with a characteristic slowing age of 1 year a signal with period $\ge 0.1\,$s it would not significantly dephase within the observation. Introducing modulation artificially shows that an amplitude of 0.15 would have been detected robustly. Implications for magnetar models of FRB are briefly considered.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of FRB 20201124A reveals its complex emission patterns through multi-epoch uGMRT observations, showing frequency-dependent activity, short burst intervals, and bimodal distributions indicative of multiple emission mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamic behavior and underlying mechanisms of repeating fast radio bursts by studying the temporal and spectral properties of FRB 20201124A during its active phase.

Method: Multi-epoch observations using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in Bands 4 and 5, analyzing burst morphology, frequency drifts, timing intervals, energy distributions, and multi-frequency correlations.

Result: Bursts displayed morphological diversity, frequency-dependent activity decline, sub-second burst intervals, bimodal waiting-time/energy distributions, and non-simultaneous multi-band emissions, suggesting multiple emission modes.

Conclusion: FRB 20201124A's complex emission behaviors highlight the dynamic nature of repeating FRBs and support models involving neutron star magnetospheric instabilities with varying energy release scales.

Abstract: We present results from multi-epoch observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) during its active phase between 8 May and 28 May 2021. The bursts exhibit significant morphological diversity, including multiple sub-bursts, downward frequency drifts, and intrinsic widths ranging from 1.032 - 32.159 ms. Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 24 May, while Band 4 activity persisted until 28 May, indicating a frequency-dependent decline. Consecutive bursts were observed with separations of 16.7 - 291.5 ms, revealing short repetition intervals or potential sub-second quasi-periodicity. The waiting-time and energy distributions are bimodal, suggesting at least two distinct emission timescales and energy modes. Burst fluence ranges from 1.72 - 78.47 Jy ms, and the cumulative fluence distribution follows a broken power law. Multi-frequency analysis further shows closely spaced burst pairs across Band 4 and Band 5, with sub-second offsets of 1.08 - 1.15 s, and no strict simultaneity with contemporaneous FAST detections. These findings demonstrate that FRB 20201124A exhibits closely spaced, patchy, multi-frequency emission with frequency-dependent activity, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of repeating FRBs.
