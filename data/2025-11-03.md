Abstract: We present jFoF, a fully GPU-native Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo finder
designed for both high-performance simulation analysis and differentiable
modeling. Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by
performing all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction
directly on GPUs, eliminating costly host--device transfers. We introduce two
complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel
linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude
speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent
halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through
discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological
optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a
REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo
connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with
discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for
differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of
structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We
make our code publicly available at https://github.com/bhorowitz/jFOF/.

Abstract: Over the past 30 years, numerous large-scale photometric astronomical surveys
have been conducted, including SDSS, Pan-STARRS, Gaia,2MASS, WISE, and others.
These surveys provide extensive photometric measurements that can be used to
infer a wide range of physical parameters of astronomical objects.
Traditionally, Bayesian approaches, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling have been employed for such inference tasks. However, these methods
tend to be computationally intensive and often require manual tuning or expert
supervision. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning model designed
to perform automatic and robust inference from photometric data, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are
widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a
unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been
developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine
learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those
that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the
efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains
underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance
Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric
redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep
Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce
probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after
detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a
compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces
reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template
fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting
(lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched.
Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry
from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a
single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small
and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential
of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples
from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on
applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES
DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating
caveats.

### [5] [Moonlit sky polarization patterns from Cerro Paranal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27308)
*B. Pereira,S. Gonzalez-Gaitan,A. M. Mourao,J. Rino-Silvestre,A. Paulino-Afonso,J. P. Anderson,A. Cikota,A. Morales-Garoffolo*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study analyzes polarization patterns of moonlit sky at Cerro Paranal, finding a combination of Rayleigh and Mie scattering plus unpolarized multiple scattering best explains observed polarization and intensity across wavelengths and angles, emphasizing the need for moonlight modeling in polarimetric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moonlit sky background significantly affects astronomical polarimetric studies, necessitating accurate modeling of its polarization properties to prevent contamination.

Method: Used FORS2 instrument for sky observations during full Moon, measuring polarization degree, intensity at varying wavelengths and scattering angles. Compared with single (Rayleigh/Mie) and multiple scattering models.

Result: Single Rayleigh models require strong wavelength-dependent depolarization factors to match polarization. Mie scattering explains intensity data. Best fits combine Rayleigh/Mie single scattering with an unpolarized multiple scattering component, with Mie/multiple contributions increasing at longer wavelengths.

Conclusion: Accurate moonlight scattering models are critical for improving polarimetric observation accuracy, highlighting the dominance of Mie and multiple scattering at longer wavelengths.

Abstract: We investigate the polarization patterns from the moonlit sky as observed
from the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal. The moonlit sky
background can be significant in astronomical observations and thus be a source
of contamination in polarimetric studies. Based on sky observations during full
Moon with FORS2 in imaging polarimetric mode, we measure the polarization
degree and intensity at different wavelengths and scattering angles from the
Moon, and compare them to theoretical and phenomenological single and multiple
scattering models. Single scattering Rayleigh models are able to reproduce the
wavelength dependence of the polarization as long as strong depolarization
factors that increase with wavelength are introduced. Intensity data, however,
require the inclusion of single Mie scattering from larger aerosol particles.
The best models that simultaneously fit polarization and intensity data, are a
combination of both single scattering processes, Rayleigh and Mie, plus an
unpolarized multiple scattering component. Both Mie and multiple scattering
become more dominant at longer wavelengths. Other factors like cloud
depolarization and the sunlight contribution during the twilight were also
investigated. The present study underscores the importance of accounting for
moonlight scattering to enhance the accuracy of polarimetric observations of
astronomical targets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Poincar\'e maps play a fundamental role in nonlinear dynamics and chaos
theory, offering a means to reduce the dimensionality of continuous dynamical
systems by tracking the intersections of trajectories with lower-dimensional
section surfaces. Traditional approaches typically rely on numerical
integration and interpolation to detect these crossings, which can lead to
inaccuracies and computational inefficiencies. This work presents a novel
methodology for constructing Poincar\'e maps based on the Theory of Functional
Connections (TFC). The constrained functionals produced by TFC yield continuous
and differentiable representations of system trajectories that exactly satisfy
prescribed constraints. The computation of Poincar\'e maps is formulated as
either an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP). For
IVPs, initial conditions are embedded into the functional, and the intersection
time with a specified section surface is determined. We demonstrate linear
convergence to the Taylor series, thereby enabling accurate interpolation
without resorting to numerical integration or external optimization. For BVPs,
periodicity conditions are encoded to identify periodic orbits in a Three-Body
Problem context. Furthermore, by enforcing periodic constraints, we show how to
construct first recurrence maps. The methodology is also extended to
non-autonomous systems, demonstrated through applications to a Four-Body
Problem. The proposed approach achieves machine-level accuracy with modest
computational effort, eliminating the need for variable transformations or
iterative integration schemes with adaptive step-sizing. The results illustrate
that TFC offers a powerful and efficient alternative framework for constructing
Poincar\'e maps, computing periodic orbits, and analyzing complex dynamical
systems, particularly in astrodynamical contexts.

### [7] [Shooting for the stars: Jet-mode feedback and AGN jet deceleration from stellar mass-loading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26881)
*Talia M. O'Shea,Sebastian Heinz,Melinda Soares-Furtado,Zsofi Igo,Andrea Merloni*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a model showing that stellar mass-loading decelerates AGN jets, making ~25% of jet power available for galaxy feedback. This depends on stellar population age, with older populations having less deceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how narrow, relativistic AGN jets couple to galaxies via kinetic feedback, focusing on jet deceleration through stellar mass entrainment.

Method: Developed a model combining stellar mass-loss rates (including main sequence stars) with radio AGN incidence data, calculating decelerated jet power fractions.

Result: Prediction that most jets are decelerated inside galaxies, replicating FR-II fractions in LERGs. ~25% of jet power is efficiently decelerated, with significant evolution over time (τ^-1.1) due to stellar population aging.

Conclusion: Stellar mass-loading via AGB and main sequence stars is critical for jet deceleration, with implications for feedback efficiency dependent on galaxy environment and stellar age.

Abstract: AGN jets are thought to be vital ingredients in galaxy evolution through the
action of kinetic feedback; however, how narrow, relativistic outflows couple
to galaxies remains an open question. Jet deceleration, which is often
attributed to the entrainment of material, such as stellar winds, is thought to
be necessary for efficient coupling. We present a simple model of jet
deceleration due to stellar mass-loading to investigate the energy budget of
direct jet feedback in the local Universe. To this end, we produce models of
stellar mass-loss, including deriving a prescription for main sequence
mass-loss rates as a function of stellar population age. We pair this mass-loss
data with a parametric fit for radio AGN incidence, predicting that a majority
of jets are decelerated within their hosts, and generally replicate the
expected FR-II fraction in LERGs. We calculate that $\gtrsim$25\% of the jet
power in the local Universe is efficiently decelerated and available for direct
feedback within galaxies for any stellar population age. This fraction is
largely invariant to the shape of the radio AGN incidence function at low jet
Eddington fractions. The stellar mass-loss rate evolves significantly over
time, approximately following $\tau^{-1.1}$, leading to corresponding decreases
in decelerated jet power in older stellar populations. Although asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars dominate mass-loss at all ages, we find that their
stochasticity is important in low-mass galaxies, and derive a critical jet
power below which main sequence stars alone are sufficient to decelerate the
jet.

TL;DR: The paper presents the detection of two binary black hole mergers (GW241011 and GW241110) with rapid primary spins and significant spin-orbit misalignment, indicative of hierarchical mergers in dense stellar environments. GW241011 also provides constraints on black hole properties and ultralight bosons.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize binary black hole systems with unique orbital and spin properties that suggest formation via hierarchical mergers in dense environments, and to use these for testing fundamental physics.

Method: Analysis of gravitational wave data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run. Parameter estimation using waveform models to infer spin orientations, mass ratios, and constraints on fundamental physics parameters.

Result: Detection of two systems with high primary spin values, measurable spin-orbit misalignment, and unequal mass ratios. GW241011's strong signal allowed testing of Kerr black hole properties, gravitational-wave multipole structure, and ruled out ultralight bosons in certain mass ranges.

Conclusion: Hierarchical mergers are plausible explanations for these systems' properties. These observations advance understanding of black hole population dynamics and fundamental physics beyond general relativity.

Abstract: We report the observation of gravitational waves from two binary black hole
coalescences during the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA detector
network, GW241011 and GW241110. The sources of these two signals are
characterized by rapid and precisely measured primary spins, non-negligible
spin--orbit misalignment, and unequal mass ratios between their constituent
black holes. These properties are characteristic of binaries in which the more
massive object was itself formed from a previous binary black hole merger, and
suggest that the sources of GW241011 and GW241110 may have formed in dense
stellar environments in which repeated mergers can take place. As the third
loudest gravitational-wave event published to date, with a median network
signal-to-noise ratio of $36.0$, GW241011 furthermore yields stringent
constraints on the Kerr nature of black holes, the multipolar structure of
gravitational-wave generation, and the existence of ultralight bosons within
the mass range $10^{-13}$--$10^{-12}$ eV.

### [9] [Revisiting the unification of tidal disruption events with polarimetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27007)
*H. C. I. Wichern,G. Leloudas,M. Pursiainen,A. Cikota,G. K. Jaisawal,P. Charalampopoulos,M. Bulla,L. Dai,J. P. Anderson,M. Gromadzki,C. P. Gutiérrez,T. E. Müller-Bravo,M. Nicholl*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study uses polarimetry to analyze optical TDEs and evaluates the unification model by linking polarization properties with X-ray brightness and geometry. Results suggest most non-relativistic TDEs fit the model, with optical emission likely reprocessed in an electron-scattering photosphere. However, some deviations indicate the model's limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ambiguity in the origin of optical emission in TDEs necessitates testing the unification scenario which posits that viewing angle and geometry explain observational diversity.

Method: Analysis of optical linear polarisation data for 19 TDEs (9 new analyses), correlating polarisation levels and trends with X-ray brightness. Includes multi-epoch observations to track polarization evolution post-peak.

Result: 14/16 non-relativistic TDEs align with the unification model. Polarisation levels are 1-2% (most cases <6%). Post-peak, polarisation decreases (5/10), increases (3/10), or remains stable (2/10). Beyond +70 days, 5/7 approach 0%. Polarization of emission lines supports electron-scattering origin.

Conclusion: TDE photospheres are initially asymmetric, evolve rapidly with efficient disk formation. While the unification model generally holds, observed deviations highlight the need for a more comprehensive framework to explain TDE diversity. Polarimetry is crucial for understanding TDE emission mechanisms.

Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes produce
multi-wavelength emission, of which the optical emission is of ambiguous
origin. A unification scenario of tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been
proposed to explain the different classes of X-ray and optically selected
events by introducing a dependence on the viewing angle and geometry. This work
aims to test the unification scenario among optically bright TDEs using
polarimetry. By studying the optical linear polarisation of 19 TDEs (of which 9
newly analysed in this work), we place constraints on their photosphere
geometry, inclination, and the emission process responsible for the optical
radiation. We study how these properties correlate with the relative X-ray
brightness. We find that 14/16 non-relativistic events can be accommodated by
the unification model. Continuum polarisation levels of optical TDEs lie most
often in the range P ~ 1-2% (13 events), and for all except one event, remain
below 6%. For those optical TDEs that have multi-epoch polarimetry, the
continuum polarisation decreases after peak light for 5/10 events, increases
for 3/10 events, and stays nearly constant for 2/10 events. When observed after
+70 days (7/16 events), they become consistent with P = 0% within uncertainties
(5/7 events). This implies the photosphere geometries of TDEs are at least
initially asymmetric and evolve rapidly which, if tracing the formation of the
accretion disk, suggests efficient circularisation. The polarisation signatures
of emission lines of 7 TDEs directly support a scenario in which optical light
is reprocessed in an electron-scattering photosphere. [...] However, a subset
of events deviates from the unification model to some extent, suggesting this
model may not fully capture the diverse behaviour of TDEs. Multi-epoch
polarimetry plays a key role in understanding the evolution and emission
mechanisms of TDEs.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that mergers of a white dwarf (WD) with a neutron
star (NS) or a stellar-mass black hole (BH) may be a potential progenitor
channel for certain merger-kind, but long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs),
e.g., GRBs 230307A and 211211A. The relatively large tidal disruption radius of
the WD can result in non-negligible residual orbital eccentricity ($0 \lesssim
e \lesssim 0.2$), causing episodic mass transfer, i.e., repeated tidal
disruptions (RPDs) of the WD. We perform smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics
simulations of RPDs in sixteen WD-BH/NS systems, capturing the subsequent mass
transfer and accretion. The WD undergoes RPDs near the orbital periastron,
modulating the ensuing accretion process, leading to variations of the
accretion rate on the orbital period. Across all simulations, the peak
accretion rates range from $4 \times10^{-4}$ to 0.2 $M_{\odot} \rm \ s^{-1}$,
while the RPD duration spans from $\sim$ 10 s to an hour. More compact systems,
i.e., those with a higher mass ratio (higher WD mass and lower accretor mass),
tend to undergo fewer RPD cycles, resulting in shorter durations and higher
accretion rates. If such events can launch relativistic jets, three categories
of non-thermal X/$\gamma$-ray transients are predicted, in decreasing order of
their mean accretion rates: (1) an X-ray transient with a simultaneous GRB,
both lasting for $10^{1-2}$ s; (2) a longer X-ray transient lasting up to
$10^{2-3}$ s that has a GRB appearing only at its later phase ; (3) an
ultra-long X-ray transient lasting for $\sim 10^{3}$ s without a GRB. A generic
feature of these transients is that their prompt emission light curves are
probably periodically modulated with periods of a few to tens of seconds.

*Zhixing Zhao,Zhong-Ying Fan,Xiaobao Wang,Minyong Guo,Bin Chen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the observational signatures of the Penrose process by simulating light curves from plasmoid fragmentation in black hole ergospheres, showing distinct flares depending on energy carryover of infalling fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide observational evidence for the Penrose process, which has lacked clear empirical support despite theoretical foundations, by analyzing magnetic reconnection events in black hole ergospheres.

Method: Simulated light curves of plasmoid hotspots under varying plasma magnetization, comparing scenarios where infalling fragments have negative vs. positive energy to identify distinct flare signatures.

Result: Fragmentation produces distinct flares whose characteristics depend on the energy sign of the infalling fragment, offering identifiable markers for the Penrose process.

Conclusion: The observed differences in flare signatures can serve as observational evidence to confirm the Penrose process in astrophysical phenomena.

Abstract: While theoretically established for decades, the Penrose process - energy
extraction from rotating black holes - still lacks clear observational
evidence. A promising theoretical framework posits magnetic reconnection in the
ergosphere as a trigger, causing a plasmoid to separate into an escaping
positive-energy fragment and an infalling negative-energy one. In this work, we
investigate the observational imprints of this scenario. We treat the energized
plasmoid as a hotspot and calculate its light curves for a realistic plasma
magnetization. In particular, we further compare with the scenario in which the
plasmoid, after fragmentation, falls into the black hole with positive energy,
while all other conditions remain unchanged. Our results reveal that the
process of fragmentation generates distinct flares, whose characteristics
depend heavily on whether the infalling fragment carries negative or positive
energy. We propose that these differences serve as identifiable signatures of
the Penrose process.

*Emanuele Greco*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper discusses how IXPE's X-ray polarization measurements provide new insights into magnetic turbulence and particle acceleration in Supernova Remnants (SNRs), enhancing understanding of Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) through analysis of polarization data alongside standard X-ray observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage IXPE's unique capability to measure X-ray polarization in SNRs, enabling direct study of magnetic field geometry and coherence, which are critical for understanding high-energy particle acceleration and confinement in SNRs.

Method: Summarizes key IXPE observational results over four years, combines polarization parameters (PD and PA) with standard X-ray spectral and imaging data to constrain magnetic turbulence structure downstream of shocks and investigate DSA processes in SNRs.

Result: IXPE reveals detailed polarization maps of SNRs, showing variations in PD and PA that indicate magnetic field turbulence properties. This data helps quantify magnetic field coherence scales and their role in electron acceleration, supporting models of DSA and synchrotron emission.

Conclusion: IXPE's polarization data is transformative in mapping SNR magnetic fields, providing constraints on turbulence parameters crucial for DSA efficiency. Integrating polarization with traditional X-ray analyses advances our knowledge of particle acceleration mechanisms in SNRs.

Abstract: Magnetic turbulence plays a crucial role in confining charged particles near
the shock front of Supernova Remnants, enabling them to reach energies up to
hundreds of TeV through a process known as Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA).
These high-energy electrons spiral along magnetic field lines, emitting X-ray
synchrotron radiation. The launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer
(IXPE) has opened a new window into the study of magnetic fields in SNRs
through X-ray polarization measurements. For the first time, IXPE allows us to
resolve the polarization degree (PD) and angle (PA) in the X-ray band across
different areas of SNRs, offering direct insight into the geometry and
coherence of magnetic fields on different scales. In this mini-review, I
summarize the key observational results on SNRs obtained with IXPE over the
past four years and discuss their implications for our understanding of
magnetic turbulence in synchrotron-emitting regions. I also show how we can
combine polarization parameters and standard X-ray spectral/imaging analysis to
better constrain the structure and scale of magnetic turbulence immediately
downstream of the shock and understand the particle acceleration occurring in
SNRs.

*Mariska Hoogkamer,Nathan Rutherford,Daniela Huppenkothen,Benjamin Ricketts,Anna L. Watts,Melissa Mendes,Isak Svensson,Achim Schwenk,Michael Kramer,Kai Hebeler,Tuomo Salmi,Devarshi Choudhury*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper proposes incorporating EOS-informed priors via normalizing flows into the pulse profile modeling (PPM) pipeline to improve neutron star mass-radius constraints, tested on two pulsars with different EOS models, showing narrowed radius intervals and sensitivity to high-density extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing two-step approach of PPM and EOS inference using EOS-agnostic priors has drawbacks like suboptimal constraints and computational inefficiency. A fully hierarchical Bayesian approach is ideal but complex. The paper aims to bridge this gap with an intermediate solution.

Method: The method uses normalizing flows to introduce EOS-informed priors on mass-radius within the existing PPM pipeline. They tested this on PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 using CS (speed of sound-based) and PP (piecewise-polytropic) EOS models constrained by chiral EFT. The EOS priors are integrated to refine parameter constraints.

Result: For both pulsars, radius credible intervals were narrower than EOS-agnostic cases. CS preferred smaller radii, PP larger. For PSR J0437-4715, an extreme geometric mode was found but questioned physically. Combining PPM posters with EOS inference via chiral EFT further tightened constraints but showed EOS-dependent shifts in radii and stiffness.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves constraints with reduced computational cost. However, results highlight sensitivity to high-density EOS extensions, emphasizing the need for better EOS models and caution in interpreting extreme modes.

Abstract: NICER has enabled mass-radius inferences for pulsars using pulse profile
modeling, providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense
matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate
steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several
drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference
where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but
implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here,
we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on
mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing
on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both
tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational
costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this
approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS
model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star
interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement
constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter.
For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower
than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring
larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more
extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically
questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference
further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field
theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density
extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller)
radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density
relation.

Abstract: Pre-explosion mass loss in supernova (SN) progenitors is a crucial unknown
factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse
zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional
core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II
and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM)
similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified
just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical
spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex,
long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM
interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag,
with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a marked
double-plateau light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000
km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric
coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry -- peaking at
p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep
more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature
throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the
best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure:
a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind.
We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing
multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction
plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and
mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved
supergiant stars from afar.

Abstract: The cosmological principle, asserting large-scale homogeneity and isotropy,
underpins the standard model of cosmology. Testing its validity using
independent astronomical probes remains crucial for understanding the global
structure of the Universe. We investigate the angular distribution of Gamma-Ray
Bursts (GRBs) using two of the most comprehensive all-sky datasets available,
the BATSE (CGRO) and Fermi GBM catalog to test the isotropy of the GRB sky at
large angular scales. We perform spherical harmonic decomposition of the GRB
sky maps and estimate the dipole and quadrupole amplitudes. Statistical
significance is evaluated by comparing the observed multipole amplitudes
against distributions derived from 500 Monte Carlo realizations of isotropic
skies. Our results show that the observed dipole amplitudes for both BATSE and
Fermi GBM datasets lie within $1\sigma$ region of their respective null
distributions. However, the quadrupole amplitude in the raw BATSE and Fermi
skies appears elevated at $3.7\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively. After
incorporating the BATSE sky exposure function, this apparent quadrupole
anisotropy vanishes, indicating that instrumental non-uniformities fully
account for the signal. Our method's reliability is validated through
controlled simulations, which show it can detect the injected dipoles in
BATSE-sized isotropic skies. These findings reinforce the statistical isotropy
of the GRB sky and underscore the importance of accurate exposure corrections
in cosmological anisotropy analyses.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Advanced LIGO O4a and prior datasets to search for gravitational-wave backgrounds from early Universe processes, setting upper limits on energy densities to constrain models like first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, and primordial black holes, while accounting for astrophysical backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe early Universe physics through gravitational-wave observations, leveraging LIGO-Virgo data to constrain theoretical models that predict detectable GW backgrounds but remain elusive.

Method: Analysis of O1-O4a gravitational-wave data to set upper limits on stochastic GW backgrounds from multiple early Universe scenarios, incorporating known astrophysical backgrounds from compact binary mergers.

Result: Non-detection allows derivation of stringent constraints on parameters of models including phase transitions, topological defects, inflationary models, and primordial black holes.

Conclusion: LIGO-Virgo observations from O1-O4a have already provided significant constraints on numerous early Universe scenarios, advancing our understanding of fundamental physics despite no direct detection.

Abstract: We search for gravitational-wave background signals produced by various early
Universe processes in the Advanced LIGO O4a dataset, combined with the data
from the earlier O1, O2, and O3 (LIGO-Virgo) runs. The absence of detectable
signals enables powerful constraints on fundamental physics. We derive
gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data
to constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early
Universe: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff
equation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations,
primordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the
presence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and
neutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered.
We address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics
models based on the obtained parameter constraints. We conclude that LIGO-Virgo
data already yield significant constraints on numerous early Universe
scenarios.

Abstract: In view of recent interest in the role of "dark" radiation in cosmology, such
as cosmic gravitational waves, sterile neutrinos, and dark photons, we clarify
the definition of adiabatic initial conditions in the kinetic theory of gases
in an expanding universe. Without assuming any form for the phase space
distribution function, we identify two possibilities: a strong and a weak
adiabatic initial condition. The strong one corresponds to the standard
adiabatic initial conditions, while the weak one is related to the strong via
internal isocurvature fluctuations. We show that both types of adiabatic
initial conditions are consistent with the separate universe approach, although
the latter requires initial internal isocurvature. In passing, we stress the
importance of using the particle local momentum in the phase space to define
the notion of adiabatic initial conditions. Doing so, we clarify that a gas of
gravitons can have adiabatic initial conditions.

Motivation: Addressing Geroch's question about the existence of extendible spacetimes without CTCs whose extensions inevitably introduce CTCs.

Method: Removal of a fractal structure from a time-rolled Minkowski spacetime to create a spacetime that is extendible but free of CTCs until extended.

Result: Demonstrated that such a spacetime exists, confirming the conjecture that extensions of CTC-free spacetimes can force the appearance of CTCs.

Conclusion: Settles Geroch's problem affirmatively by providing a concrete example, showing that some spacetimes' extensions inherently reintroduce CTCs after their removal.

Abstract: By removing a fractal from time-rolled Minkowski spacetime, we construct an
extendible spacetime without closed timelike curves whose every extension
contains closed timelike curves. This settles a question posed by Geroch.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for computing entanglement entropy across
surfaces in Loop Quantum Gravity by employing techniques from quantum error
correcting codes. In this construction, the redundancy encoded in the gauge
invariant subspace is made manifest by embedding it in a larger Hilbert space.
The enlarged Hilbert space of a surface does not factorize, which necessitates
an algebraic formulation of the entanglement entropy using von Neumann
algebras. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce the expected black hole
entropy through the canonical ensemble. This includes a direct realization of
the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, providing a first principles derivation of the
black hole entropy within a kinematical framework of loop quantum gravity. The
algebraic techniques developed in this work can be used to compute the
entanglement entropy across arbitrary surfaces.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-sensitivity optical measurements such as those performed in
interferometric gravitational wave detectors are prone to scattered light
noise. To minimize it, optical components must meet tight requirements on
surface roughness and bulk defects. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these
measures can be undermined by other sources of scattered light. In this
article, we examine scattered light noise caused by particles deposited on
surfaces, especially on the baffles inside the vacuum pipes of the Einstein
Telescope's interferometer arms. First, we study light scattering by particles
deposited on a surface and having diameters from about one tenth to hundred
times the light wavelength: we discuss its angular distribution and dependence
on particle size and refractive index, and on polarization. Then, we specialize
to the case of the Einstein Telescope arms and quantify the maximum allowed
density of particles on each arm baffle. We conclude with cleanliness
guidelines for the assembly of the vacuum pipes, including the required
cleanliness class of the installation environment.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method to calculate entanglement entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) using von Neumann algebras, deriving an area law with renormalized coefficients and logarithmic corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of defining entanglement entropy in LQG due to non-factorizing Hilbert spaces caused by gauge invariance, and to explore its implications for black hole entropy.

Method: Uses von Neumann algebras generated by holonomy and flux operators on a graph to define entanglement entropy. Applies this formalism to fixed-area states (spin network superpositions) and maximizes entropy to derive the area law.

Result: Derives an area law where entanglement entropy is proportional to the surface area, with bulk entanglement contributing to coefficient renormalization and logarithmic corrections.

Conclusion: The findings align with LQG-based black hole entropy calculations, suggesting a connection between algebraic entanglement measures and gravitational entropy.

Abstract: The non-factorizing nature of the Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)
due to gauge invariance requires a generalized definition of entanglement
entropy. This work employs the framework of von Neumann algebras to investigate
the entanglement entropy in LQG. On a graph, the holonomy and flux operators
within a region and on the boundary generate a non-factor type I von Neumann
algebra, which is used to define the entanglement entropy for LQG states. This
algebraic formalism is applied to ``fixed-area states''--superpositions of spin
networks associated with a surface with a definite macroscopic area given by
the LQG area spectrum. By maximizing the entropy, we derive a geometrical area
law where the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area. In addition, we
show that bulk entanglement can renormalize the area-law coefficient and
produce logarithmic corrections. The results in this paper closely relate to
LQG black hole entropy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand gravitational entropy in LQG by computing entanglement entropy via a Lorentzian path integral approach, avoiding issues related to Euclidean methods and contour prescriptions.

Method: Calculates entanglement entropy for spatial regions using dynamically generated spinfoam states over 2-complexes, linking the result to the LQG area spectrum and Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ.

Result: Entanglement entropy follows an area law S ≃ βa, with β independent of underlying 2-complexes. For 0 < γ ≲ 1/2, this matches the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy without needing contour prescriptions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a consistent Lorentzian path integral derivation of gravitational entropy in LQG, supporting the area law and BH formula within specific γ ranges.

Abstract: This paper investigates entanglement entropy in 3+1 dimensional Lorentzian
covariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We compute the entanglement entropy for a
spatial region from states dynamically generated by a spinfoam path integral
that sums over a family of 2-complexes. The resulting entropy exhibits a
geometric area law, $S \simeq \beta a$, where the area $a$ of the entangling
surface is determined by the LQG area spectrum and the leading coefficient
$\beta>0$ is independent of the underlying 2-complexes. By relating the
coupling constant of the sum over 2-complexes to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
$\gamma$, we reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the range $0 < \gamma
\lesssim 1/2$. This work provides a Lorentzian path integral approach to
gravitational entropy without the need for contour prescriptions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spinfoam stack framework to resolve triangulation dependence in spinfoam quantum gravity by summing over 2-complexes generated by stacking faces on a root complex. In the large cutoff limit, the amplitude localizes to SU(2) flat connections, reducing dynamics to a topological theory and achieving triangulation independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental issue of triangulation dependence in spinfoam models, a critical problem for establishing background-independent quantum gravity theories.

Method: Introduces spinfoam stacks - an infinite sum over 2-complexes built by stacking faces on a root complex. Uses stationary phase analysis in the infinite area cutoff limit to derive critical behavior.

Result: Amplitude localization on SU(2) flat connections, factorization of the amplitude into normalization and boundary terms, and renormalization achieving triangulation independence in the limit.

Conclusion: Demonstrates triangulation independence in a controlled limit, pointing towards a possible non-trivial fixed point of quantum gravity in spinfoam formalism, significant step toward defining a consistent quantum gravity theory.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental issue of triangulation dependence in
spinfoam quantum gravity. It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam
stack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of
2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of
faces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing
the amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area
of internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an
integral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold.
This manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the
underlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics
from a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF
theory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a
powerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a
triangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends
only on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result
that is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex. This
provides a concrete realization of triangulation independence in a well-defined
limit, suggesting the possibility of existing a non-trivial fixed point of
quantum gravity within the spinfoam formalism.

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as
superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect
the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction
(DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the
emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and
their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be
extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and,
therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the
dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing
ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially reveals the
properties of the dark sector and sheds light on the primordial origin of the
stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant
DM parameters.

*Kai Lin,Alan B. Pavan,Amilcar Rabelo de Queiroz,Elcio Abdalla*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the behavior of axial gravitational perturbations in Anti-de Sitter spacetime for homogeneous stars. Using tortoise coordinates, the study shows that gravitational waves form standing waves due to the finite potential well, leading to reflective echoes and dispersion of Gaussian wave packets through shooting and finite difference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how gravitational perturbations behave in Anti-de Sitter spacetime, focusing on the confinement of gravitational waves and their dynamic interactions with the stellar surface due to the coordinate transformation to tortoise coordinates.

Method: The research combines the shooting method and finite difference method. The shooting method is applied to demonstrate standing wave patterns for n=0,1,2 harmonics. The finite difference method simulates a Gaussian wave packet's reflection and dispersion within the potential well.

Result: The perturbations exhibit standing wave patterns and generate echoes upon reflection at the star's surface. The Gaussian wave packet loses its shape over time, dispersing within the finite potential well.

Conclusion: Gravitational perturbations in Anti-de Sitter spacetime result in confined standing waves and dispersive echoes due to the finite tortoise coordinate domain, which traps waves within a well-defined region.

Abstract: The article studies the dynamical behavior of axial gravitational
perturbations of homogeneous stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Because the
radial coordinate $r$ transforms into the tortoise coordinate $y = y(r)$,
obeying $y(r=0)=0$ and $y(r\rightarrow\infty)=y_\text{max}<\infty$, the
tortoise coordinates domain is finite, and the gravitational waves fail to
reach out of the domain. Thus, from the perspective of tortoise coordinates,
the perturbation equation of uniform density stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime
is analogous to the infinite deep potential well in quantum mechanics.
Therefore, the perturbative behavior in this spacetime represents a standing
wave vibration. Here we use shooting method and finite difference method to
show the imagery of standing waves in this spacetime for $n=0,1,2$ as examples.
On the other hand, by finite difference method, a Gaussian wave packet bounces
back and forth within this potential well. Furthermore, due to the shape of the
gravitational potential function $V$ within the range $0\le y\le y_\text{max}$,
an echo phenomenon occurs at the surface of the star. As the energy of the wave
packet remains within the potential well, each time it traverses the surface of
the star, a reflective echo is generated. Consequently, after multiple
reflections, the Gaussian wave packet cannot maintain its original shape and
ultimately disperses.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Magnetized relativistic compact stars can be significantly more massive than non-magnetized ones, especially with strong magnetic fields (~10^17-10^18 G). Using the COCAL code, the study finds 'supramassive' solutions (exceeding non-rotating maximum mass by >10%) and even 'hypermassive' solutions surpassing rotating mass-shedding limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how magnetic field configurations (mixed poloidal/toroidal) influence maximum mass limits of compact stars beyond previous studies, particularly exploring extreme field strengths and their impact on overcoming rotational mass limits.

Method: Systematic numerical computations using the COCAL code to model equilibrium solutions for magnetized compact stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic fields, comparing mass limits against non-magnetized and uniformly rotating scenarios.

Result: Supramassive solutions exceed non-rotating max mass by over 10%; extreme fields produce hypermassive solutions surpassing rotating Kepler limit masses. This demonstrates magnetic fields' critical role in supporting-extraordinary compact star masses.

Conclusion: Magnetic fields can enable compact stars to exceed traditional mass limits set by rotation or spherical symmetry, suggesting magnetic effects must be considered in modeling neutron star populations and merger events.

Abstract: It is known that the mass of magnetized relativistic compact star is larger
than that of non-magnetized one for the same equation of state and central
density, albeit the excess of mass is sizable only if the magnetic fields are
strong enough B~10^17-10^18G. Using our recently developed numerical code
COCAL, we systematically compute such compact star solutions in equilibrium
associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, and show the
magnetically supramassive solutions whose masses exceed by more than 10% of the
maximum mass of the static and spherically symmetric solutions. For some
extremely strong magnetic field configurations, we also obtain solutions more
massive than the maximum mass of the uniformly rotating solutions at the Kepler
(mass-shedding) limit, namely magnetically hypermassive solutions.

### [29] [The quasinormal modes of the rotating quantum corrected black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27320)
*Jia-Ning Chen,Zong-Kuan Guo,Liang-Bi Wu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines quasinormal modes (QNMs) of rotating quantum-corrected black holes (RQCBHs) using the hyperboloidal framework and pseudo-spectral methods. A parameter estimation pipeline using pyRing in the ringdown phase reveals that small deviations in QNMs spectra can significantly affect posterior distributions of black hole mass and spin due to correlations with quantum gravity parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how quantum corrections to black hole physics influence gravitational wave parameter estimation, particularly in the ringdown phase, and assess the impact of quantum gravity effects on inferred black hole properties.

Method: The hyperboloidal framework transforms the QNMs problem into a 2D eigenvalue problem, solved via a 2D pseudo-spectral method. The pyRing tool is used to construct a parameter estimation pipeline for RQCBH models using gravitational wave data.

Result: Even minor spectral deviations from Kerr QNMs cause strong correlations between quantum gravity parameters and black hole mass/spin, altering their posterior distributions significantly.

Conclusion: Quantum gravity effects on black hole QNMs cannot be ignored in precision gravitational wave astronomy, as they introduce biases in parameter estimation that require model considerations beyond classical Kerr geometry.

Abstract: The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a rotating quantum corrected black hole
(RQCBH) are studied by employing the hyperboloidal framework for the scalar
perturbation. This framework is used to cast the QNMs spectra problem into the
two-dimensional eigenvalues problem, then the spectra are calculated by
imposing two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method. Based on the resulting
spectra, a parameter estimation pipeline for this RQCBH model with
gravitational wave data is constructed by using \texttt{pyRing} in the ringdown
phase. We find that, even when the RQCBH spectra exhibits a small deviation
from the Kerr spectra, the strong correlation between the extra parameter
coming from the quantum gravity theory and the intrinsic parameter of black
hole may significantly affect the posterior distributions of the mass $M$ and
the dimensionless spin $\bar{a}$.

*Mikel Artola,Ismael Ayuso,Ruth Lazkoz,Gonzalo Olmo,Vincenzo Salzano*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new $f(Q,C)$ gravity framework that combines different geometric terms to modify cosmology, leading to dark energy models preferred over ΛCDM, and shows how to convert solutions to $f(Q)$ models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore modifications to General Relativity that explain cosmic acceleration through geometrically derived dark energy, proposing a non-separable $f(Q,C)$ model that avoids higher-order derivatives.

Method: A general $f(Q,C)$ formulation is proposed, utilizing a specific connection to derive cosmological models. A modified DGP model variant is analyzed, and a method to translate solutions between $f(Q,C)$ and $f(Q)$ frameworks is demonstrated.

Result: The proposed $f(Q,C)$ models, particularly the DGP variant, are statistically favored over ΛCDM. A translation mechanism between $f(Q,C)$ and $f(Q)$ solutions is established.

Conclusion: The framework provides a viable avenue for evolving dark energy models compatible with observations, offering an alternative to ΛCDM with improved statistical support.

Abstract: The $f(Q,C)$ framework of gravity enables the depiction of an effective dark
energy fluid that emerges from geometry itself, thus leading to modifications
in the cosmological phenomenology of General Relativity. We pursue this
approach to discover new and observationally supported (effective) evolving
dark energy models. We propose a general $f(Q,C)$ formulation that cannot be
simply split into separate functions of $Q$ and $C$, yet it still results in
second-order field equations. By employing a particular type of connection, we
derive guidelines for new cosmological models, including a variant of the DGP
model that appears to be statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, we
also demonstrate how to translate solutions within this $f(Q,C)$ framework to
$f(Q)$ counterparts at the background level.

Abstract: The evaporation of black holes with two horizons presents a rich
thermodynamic landscape that departs fundamentally from the Schwarzschild
paradigm. In this work, we analyze the Hawking temperature dynamics of the
Kiselev black hole under varying mass $M$ and anisotropic fluid parameter $N$,
explicitly connecting temperature behavior to phase transitions and violations
of the null energy condition (NEC). We find that the temperature does not
necessarily diverge during evaporation; instead, it typically falls to zero as
the black hole evaporates. This cooling behavior is preceded, in certain
parameter regimes, by a phase transition marked by a peak in temperature and a
divergence in heat capacity. Crucially, the presence and nature of these phase
transitions are dictated by the spacetime regions where the NEC is violated:
global NEC violation leads to horizon merger and temperature suppression, while
partial or absent violation can restore the standard evaporation picture. Our
results establish a direct correspondence between thermodynamic stability,
horizon dynamics, and energy condition structure in anisotropic black hole
spacetimes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has intensified the need for efficient,
high-precision modeling of the two-body problem in General Relativity. Current
analytical methods, primarily the Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian
expansions, are inherently perturbative, while numerical relativity remains
computationally expensive. In this Letter, we introduce a middle path: an exact
renormalization group (RG) equation for classical gravitational systems. We
demonstrate that our equation correctly reproduces the first three orders of
the Post-Minkowskian expansion. Crucially, it provides a framework for
non-perturbative approximations. As a first application, we show that our
method efficiently recovers the 1PN two-body action, bypassing the need for
complex three-graviton vertex calculations by leveraging the intrinsic
nonlinearity of the RG flow. This establishes the exact RG as a powerful new
tool for tackling strong-field dynamics in gravity.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a refined calculation of radiative corrections in tau->pipivTau decays, incorporating structure-dependent effects via pion form factor to improve the evaluation of muon's a_mu^HVP,LO[pi pi, tau].


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reliably account for radiative corrections in tau decays for an accurate data-driven determination of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon g-2 anomaly.

Method: Model-independent analysis including dispersive representation of pion form factor to capture structure-dependent loop effects beyond point-like pions, incorporating resonance-enhanced terms and threshold effects, with matching strategies to chiral perturbation theory.

Result: Significant changes in corrections due to rho resonance enhancement, identification of necessary higher-order isospin-breaking terms, and improved dispersive fits to tau->pipivTau spectra.

Conclusion: Structure-dependent effects and threshold terms critically impact the precision of a_mu^HVP calculation, requiring inclusion of specific higher-order terms for improved accuracy. This advances data-driven approaches to muon g-2 anomaly analysis.

Abstract: A reliable calculation of radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$
decays is an important prerequisite for using hadronic $\tau$ decays for a
data-driven evaluation of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In
this Letter, we present an improved model-independent analysis of these
radiative corrections, including, for the first time, effects beyond point-like
pions in the evaluation of the loop diagrams. These structure-dependent
corrections, implemented via a dispersive representation of the pion form
factor, lead to significant changes compared to previous calculations due to
enhancements near the $\rho(770)$ resonance. We also devise strategies for the
matching to chiral perturbation theory and a stable implementation of the real
corrections down to the two-pion threshold, which shows that some higher-order
isospin-breaking corrections need to be kept due to a strong threshold
enhancement. Finally, we perform dispersive fits to the currently available
$\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectra and discuss the consequences for
isospin-breaking corrections in the evaluation of $a_\mu^\text{HVP,
LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the renormalization-group evolution of parameters in a 3D EFT model of the electroweak phase transition induced by beyond-Standard Model physics. It calculates two-loop couplings with non-renormalizable terms, compares them with super-renormalizable cases, and explores implications for perturbative potential calculations and future lattice simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately model the first-order electroweak phase transition driven by beyond-Standard Model physics, necessitated by the need to explain cosmological observations like baryogenesis and dark matter, which require strong phase transitions.

Method: Two-loop RG analysis of 3D EFT couplings including leading non-renormalizable terms, comparison of beta function contributions between super-renormalizable and non-renormalizable cases, and examination of higher-order corrections to mass and operator running.

Result: Non-renormalizable contributions significantly alter beta functions compared to super-renormalizable cases, impacting scalar potential perturbative calculations. This establishes foundation for incorporating these effects into lattice simulations of phase transition dynamics.

Conclusion: Higher-order corrections in 3D EFT parameter evolution must be considered for precise phase transition studies. Future lattice simulations incorporating these effects will provide critical tests of beyond-Standard Model scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we study the renormalization-group evolution of parameters in
the three-dimensional effective field theory (3D EFT) that describes the
thermally driven electroweak phase transition of the Higgs field. We focus on
the first-order case, triggered by beyond the Standard Model physics. We
compute the two-loop running of the 3D EFT couplings, including the effect of
the leading non-renormalizable terms. We then analyze how the new contributions
to the beta functions compare with those in the super-renormalizable case,
highlighting their impact on perturbative computations of the scalar potential,
which describes the vacuum structure of the theory. By incorporating
higher-order corrections in the mass parameter evolution, as well as the
running of other effective operators, we set the stage for testing their impact
on phase transition dynamics in lattice simulations.

### [35] [All is More: Energy Flow Networks for Jet Quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26879)
*João A. Gonçalves*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates advanced machine learning techniques, particularly energy flow networks (EFNs), combined with physics-based observables, for enhancing jet-by-jet discrimination between proton-proton and lead-lead collisions in heavy-ion experiments to better study jet quenching in the quark-gluon plasma. The proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of ~0.83.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jet quenching studies require precise discrimination between jets in different collision environments to probe medium properties. Existing methods struggle with underlying event contamination and medium effects, motivating the development of improved discriminative tools.

Method: Two main approaches are tested: (1) baseline models using linear discriminants and neural networks trained on high-level observables like N-subjettiness and energy flow polynomials; (2) EFNs trained on jet constituents, further enhanced by concatenating standardized physics observables into the latent space. A variant called moment EFN offers a more compact, interpretable latent space.

Result: In realistic scenarios with underlying event contamination and medium effects, observable-enhanced EFNs achieve an AUC of ~0.83, surpassing linear/non-linear baselines and prior methods. Moment EFNs match this performance with better interpretability.

Conclusion: EFN-based approaches, especially when enriched with physics observables, provide robust tools for jet quenching studies, demonstrating practical utility in handling complex medium effects.

Abstract: Jet quenching, the modification of jets by the quark-gluon plasma in
heavy-ion collisions, provides a sensitive probe of the properties of the
medium. A jet-by-jet discrimination study between proton-proton and lead-lead
jets using energy flow networks and simple baselines, explicitly retaining
medium response and underlying event contamination is presented. As references,
linear discriminants and neural networks have been trained on high-level
observables such as $N$-subjettiness and energy flow polynomials, including an
extended energy flow polynomial set, in order to quantify the achievable
performance without constituent-level learning. Energy flow networks are then
trained on jet constituents and extended to observable-enhanced energy flow
networks that concatenate standardized $N$-subjettiness and/or energy flow
polynomials to the energy flow network latent space. In the realistic scenario,
including both underlying event contamination and medium response,
observable-enhanced energy flow networks set state-of-the-art performance with
receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of $\simeq 0.83$,
improving markedly over linear and non-linear baselines and previous work with
different architectures. Finally, results from moment energy flow networks, an
energy flow network variant that attains comparable area under the curve with a
substantially more compact and interpretable latent space are shown. These
results establish energy-flow-network-based approaches (especially when
enhanced with physics-motivated observables) as practical and robust tools for
jet-quenching studies.

*Ulaş Özdem*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study uses QCD light-conesum rules to compute electromagnetic moments of a strange pentaquark, finding significant variation and deformation, which can help understand its quark structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the internal quark-gluon geometry and spatial charge distributions of pentaquarks, addressing a key problem in hadron spectroscopy.

Method: Constructed five interpolating currents for diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations and applied QCD light-cone sum rules to calculate magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments.

Result: Electromagnetic moments showed sensitivity to quark arrangement. Magnetic dipole moments varied widely (-2.28 to +3.36 μ_N), indicating configuration differences. Non-zero quadrupole and octupole moments suggested non-spherical shapes, with light quarks dominating magnetism and charm quark causing deformation.

Conclusion: Electromagnetic multipole moments are effective probes for exotic hadron structures, offering benchmarks for future experiments and lattice QCD simulations.

Abstract: Understanding how quarks are spatially arranged inside exotic pentaquarks
remains one of the key open problems in contemporary hadron spectroscopy. The
electromagnetic multipole moments of hadrons provide a direct probe of their
internal quark--gluon geometry and spatial charge distributions. Motivated by
this, we employ QCD light-cone sum rules to compute the magnetic dipole,
electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $J^P = 3/2^-$
pentaquark with strangeness $S = -1$. Five distinct diquark--diquark--antiquark
interpolating currents are constructed to explore possible internal
configurations. The resulting electromagnetic moments exhibit pronounced
sensitivity to the underlying quark arrangement: magnetic dipole moments range
from $-2.28\mu_N$ to $+3.36\mu_N$, establishing this observable as a key
discriminator among configurations with identical quantum numbers. Nonzero
electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments indicate clear deviations
from spherical symmetry, while a detailed decomposition shows that light quarks
dominate the magnetic response and the charm quark drives quadrupole
deformation. These findings position electromagnetic multipole moments as
quantitative and discriminating probes of exotic hadron structure, providing
concrete benchmarks for forthcoming LHCb, Belle~II, and lattice QCD studies.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of the high-luminosity LHC to detect long-lived Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) produced through axion-like particle (ALP) portals and gluon interactions. By considering both far detectors and the ATLAS experiment, the study aims to improve sensitivity to HNL parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HNLs and ALPs are key BSM physics candidates. ALPs with gluon couplings are abundant at the LHC, offering a pathway to produce HNLs via the ALP portal, potentially enhancing sensitivity to HNL properties beyond current limits.

Method: The authors simulate LHC scenarios using future far detectors and ATLAS, focusing on HNL production via dimension-8 operators (in the heavy ALP mass limit) and $N_R$SMEFT operators involving gluons. They calculate detection prospects and parameter space coverage.

Result: The study demonstrates that the high-luminosity LHC with far detectors can significantly extend sensitivity to HNL masses and mixing parameters, particularly in ALP portal and gluon-mediated production channels, outperforming previous experiments.

Conclusion: Future LHC runs with optimized far detector setups and ATLAS data could provide unprecedented insights into HNL and ALP parameters, bridging gaps in BSM physics exploration beyond the Standard Model.

Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) and axion-like particles (ALPs) are both
considered well-motivated candidates for beyond the standard model (BSM)
physics. ALPs with couplings to gluons will be abundantly produced at the LHC.
Therefore, HNLs produced via the ALP portal may provide unprecedented
sensitivities to HNL parameters. Here, we study the prospects for the
high-luminosity LHC to search for long-lived HNLs. We consider future far
detectors as well as ATLAS in our simulations. In the limit where the ALP mass
is large, HNLs are effectively produced by a dimension-8 operator connecting
HNL pairs to gluons. For completeness, we therefore also calculate future LHC
sensitivities for HNLs produced via $N_R$SMEFT operators with gluons.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper extends the relativistic Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter framework to mesons with J=4,5, deriving new Dirac tensor representations. It predicts masses for high-spin mesons (J=3-5), identifies Regge trajectories, and highlights the limitations of rainbow-ladder truncation requiring more advanced interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the applicability of the Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach to higher angular momentum mesons (J=4,5), which were previously unstudied, and assess the viability of the rainbow-ladder truncation model for predicting meson spectra.

Method: The method involves developing general Dirac tensor representations for J=4,5 mesons and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations under rainbow-ladder truncation. The resulting mass predictions and heavy-quark potential shape are analyzed.

Result: Predicted masses for J=3^{--}, 4^{++}, 5^{--} mesons show identifiable Regge trajectories in some channels. Discrepancies in other channels indicate the need for improved interaction models beyond rainbow-ladder truncation.

Conclusion: The rainbow-ladder approximation provides semi-quantitative success for certain high-spin mesons but fails in others, confirming the necessity of more sophisticated interaction terms in future Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter calculations.

Abstract: We extend the range of application of the relativistic
Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach from previously discussed mesons with
total angular momentum $J \le 3$ to the ones with $J=4,5$. On a technical
level, the new element is the general Dirac tensor representations for the
latter which, to our knowledge, are presented here for the first time. As a
first application, we provide an exploratory spectrum for these mesons in a
rainbow-ladder truncation of Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We
discuss the merits and limitations of this truncation and explore the shape of
the heavy-quark potential corresponding to the underlying effective running
coupling. With our predictions for the masses of ground state mesons with
quantum numbers $J^{P,C}=3^{--}, 4^{++}, 5^{--}$ we identify Regge trajectories
in channels where the interaction model can be trusted on a semi-quantitative
level. In other channels, discrepancies with experiments confirm the well-known
need to go beyond rainbow-ladder in the Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach
by using more sophisticated interactions.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops a flexible phenomenological model for pion-nucleon transition distribution amplitudes (πN TDAs) to study cross sections and polarization asymmetries in backward region electron-proton scattering processes. The model uses a two-component factorized ansatz for spectral densities, incorporates threshold production theorem constraints, and includes experimental data-fitted forward contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately describe and predict cross sections and polarization asymmetries in specific electron-proton scattering processes, particularly in the backward region, where existing approaches may lack flexibility or precision.

Method: Developing a phenomenological model for πN TDAs based on a two-component factorized ansatz for spectral densities (quadruple distributions), incorporating threshold theorem constraints and adjustable forward limit contributions. The model's sensitivity to different assumptions is analyzed.

Result: The model allows examination of how various modelling choices affect predictions of observables related to $e p 	o e n ho^+$ and $e p 	o e p ho^0$ processes in the backward region.

Conclusion: The approach provides a structured framework to systematically study uncertainties and constraints in QCD collinear factorization descriptions of these scattering processes, offering improved interpretability of experimental data.

Abstract: To study cross sections and polarization asymmetries for the processes $e p
\to e n \pi^+$ and $e p \to e p \pi^0$ in the backward region, we develop a
flexible phenomenological model for nucleon-to-pion transition distribution
amplitudes ($\pi N$ TDAs), which are used in the QCD collinear factorization
description of the scattering amplitudes. Our model is based on the
two-component factorized Ansatz for the corresponding spectral densities,
quadruple distribution. It takes into account the constraints for $\pi N$ TDAs
arising from the threshold pion production theorem and also includes a forward
limit contribution that can be fitted to experimental data. We examine the
sensitivity of observable predictions to various modelling assumptions.

TL;DR: The paper examines trilinear Higgs boson couplings in various extended Higgs models where the Standard Model Higgs field primarily determines the coupling. It includes analysis of higher-order corrections and discusses future collider prospects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how extended Higgs models can modify the trilinear Higgs coupling while remaining consistent with experimental constraints, emphasizing models where the SM Higgs dominates the coupling.

Method: Analytical investigation of functional forms of extended Higgs potentials, inclusion of higher-order top quark and new particle corrections, and assessment of their impact on the coupling strength.

Result: Identified that models like nearly aligned Higgs EFT, classically scale-invariant models, and PNGB scenarios show significant deviations when considering higher-order terms. Future colliders can distinguish between different potential functional forms.

Conclusion: Future high-precision measurements at colliders are crucial to probe extended Higgs sector models by testing the functional forms of their potentials, especially considering often-neglected higher-order contributions.

Abstract: We investigate the trilinear Higgs boson coupling derived from the functional
forms of various extended Higgs potentials. In light of experimental
constraints on Higgs boson couplings, we focus on extended Higgs models in
which the trilinear Higgs boson coupling is predominantly determined by the
Standard Model (SM) Higgs field. Such models include the nearly aligned Higgs
effective field theory, classically scale-invariant models,
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson scenarios, tadpole-induced models, and others. We
also consider higher-order corrections, including top quark and new particle
contributions that are often neglected, and discuss their impact on the
trilinear Higgs boson coupling. Finally, we show to what extent the functional
forms of the Higgs potentials can be probed at future colliders.

TL;DR: The paper presents the first complete three-loop QCD soft anomalous dimension calculation for multileg amplitudes involving one massive and multiple massless coloured particles, using a lightcone Wilson line expansion and differential equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully understand the structure of infrared divergences in QCD processes involving massive particles, which is essential for precision calculations in particle physics experiments like the LHC.

Method: A novel lightcone expansion of Wilson line correlators using the method of regions, followed by solving differential equations for region integrals expressed in terms of generalized polylogarithms.

Result: Three-loop soft anomalous dimension matrix expressed through uniform weight five generalized polylogarithms with a 12-letter alphabet, consistent with massless limits and collinear factorization properties.

Conclusion: This result provides crucial ingredients for higher-order QCD computations and validates the approach through consistency checks with known limits and factorization properties.

Abstract: We determine the complete three-loop QCD soft anomalous dimension for
multileg amplitudes involving a single massive coloured particle and any number
of massless ones. This is achieved by applying a novel strategy based on a
lightcone expansion of correlators of semi-infinite Wilson lines using the
method of regions. The resulting region integrals depend exclusively on
rescaling-invariant ratios that remain finite in the limit. We evaluate these
integrals using differential equation techniques. The result is written in
terms of uniform weight five generalised polylogarithms of a twelve letter
alphabet in three variables, and is compatible with the massless limit as well
as with two- and three-particle collinear factorization.

### [42] [CMB observables and reheat temperature as a window to models of inflation and freeze-in dark matter production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27587)
*Anish Ghoshal,Paweł Kozów,Marek Olechowski,Stefan Pokorski*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic method using CMB observables and reheating temperature to distinguish inflationary models and freeze-in dark matter scenarios, focusing on α-attractor models. It links CMB data to particle physics via reheating constraints and argues that precision CMB measurements could tighten constraints on dark matter production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discriminate between inflation models and dark matter scenarios by connecting cosmological data (CMB) with particle physics mechanisms, addressing tensions in current measurements like Planck and DESI-ACT.

Method: Expresses inflation parameters in terms of CMB observables (n_s, A_s, r) and calculates reheating temperature using inflaton's equation of state (w) and dissipation (Γ). Tests model validity by translating reheating bounds into narrow ranges of n_s, then links to non-thermal DM production.

Result: Shows that reheating constraints create tight spectral index limits for α-attractor models, impacted by current CMB tensions. Future precise CMB data could impose stronger bounds on DM scenarios.

Conclusion: CMB observables and reheating temperatures offer a robust framework to test inflation models and dark matter co-production. Enhanced CMB precision will unify cosmological and particle physics constraints, resolving tensions requires precise parameter fittings.

Abstract: A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating
temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain
freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of
$\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all
independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of
the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$,
scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a
standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state
parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\Gamma$ the reheating
temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some
pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model
independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the
upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each
class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral
index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB
data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact
on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying
those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB
observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an
example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One
obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM
production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the
reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints
on the DM production will follow.

*Nikhil Krishna,Mariola Klusek-Gawenda,Antoni Szczurek*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines charged kaon pair production in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions through photoproduction and photon-photon fusion, considering meson decays. It compares cross sections with experimental data and provides predictions for Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind K+K- production in ultraperipheral collisions, validate theoretical models against experimental data, and predict outcomes for higher energy collisions.

Method: The analysis combines elementary-level processes (gamma-gamma → meson → K+K-) with nuclear-level interactions (Pb-Pb → Pb-Pb K+K-). Cross sections from gamma-gamma fusion are compared with Belle, TPC/Two-Gamma, and ARGUS experiments.

Result: The model consistently describes existing midrapidity measurements and offers predictions for ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV, contributing to the validation of production mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study confirms the role of meson decays and photon interactions in K+K- production, aligning theoretical predictions with experimental results and providing a basis for future high-energy studies.

Abstract: The production of charged kaon pairs in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions
can proceed via photoproduction (gamma-Pomeron interaction) or via
photon-photon fusion. An important contribution to this process arises from the
decays of scalar, tensor and vector mesons. This study provides a consistent
description of K+K- production at both the elementary level (gamma gamma ->
meson -> K+K-) and the nuclear level (Pb Pb -> Pb Pb K+K-). The gamma gamma
fusion cross section is compared with experimental results from Belle,
TPC/Two-Gamma and ARGUS. A comparison with existing midrapidity measurements is
presented, together with theoretical predictions for ultraperipheral Pb-Pb
collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 5.02 TeV.

### [44] [Beyond Leading Logarithms in $g_V$: The Semileptonic Weak Hamiltonian at $\mathcal{O}(α\,α_s^2)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27648)
*Francesco Moretti,Martin Gorbahn,Sebastian Jaeger*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a next-to-leading-logarithmic QCD analysis of electromagnetic corrections to the semileptonic weak Hamiltonian, including mixed αα_s² corrections to g_V. Combining three-loop anomalous dimensions and two-loop matching corrections with a consistent QCD factorization via a d-dimensional OPE in loop integrals, they obtain Δ̃_R^V = 2.432(16)%, which enhances CKM unitarity tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision and consistency of semileptonic weak interactions calculations by incorporating higher-order QCD corrections, addressing gaps in previous analyses lacking mixed αα_s² terms and consistent short-distance QCD factorization.

Method: 1. Calculated three-loop QCD anomalous dimensions for operators.
2. Applied two-loop matching corrections at electroweak scale.
3. Implemented d-dimensional operator product expansion within loop integrals to factorize short-distance effects.
4. Performed renormalization-group improvement to evolve results down to low scales.

Result: Obtained precise radiative correction Δ̃_R^V = 2.432(16)%, with uncertainty from higher-order terms. Demonstrated the framework's compatibility with lattice QCD and perturbative extensions.

Conclusion: The improved correction provides better constraints for CKM unitarity tests. The method establishes a systematic pathway for future precision studies combining lattice and perturbative QCD inputs.

Abstract: We present the first next-to-leading-logarithmic QCD analysis of the
electromagnetic corrections to the semileptonic weak Hamiltonian, including the
mixed $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\,\alpha_s^2)$ corrections to the vector coupling
$g_V$. The analysis combines the evaluation of three-loop anomalous dimensions
and two-loop matching corrections with a consistent factorization of
short-distance QCD effects. The latter is implemented through a scheme change
based on a $d$-dimensional operator product expansion performed inside the loop
integrals. The resulting renormalization-group--improved expression for the
radiative correction $\Delta^V_R = 2.432(16)\%$ can be systematically refined
using input from lattice QCD and perturbation theory and improves the
consistency of first-row CKM unitarity tests.

### [45] [Soft Gravitons, Hard Truths: Infrared Safety of Particle Processes in a Gravitational-Wave Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27690)
*Wen-Yuan Ai,Sebastian A. R. Ellis,Josef Pradler*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that gravitational waves remain transparent through matter by examining their effect on unstable particles. It demonstrates that while initial expectations suggest enhanced decay rates from graviton emission/absorption, a more rigorous analysis using soft-graviton methods and infrared safety shows that decay rates remain unchanged, confirming mutual transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the long-held belief that gravitational waves pass through matter without attenuation due to a cancellation between absorption and emission, and to investigate the validity of this mechanism when considering the reverse scenario: the impact of gravitational-wave backgrounds on matter, particularly for unstable particles.

Method: Extended the soft-graviton framework to include real and virtual processes in a gravitational wave background, then resummed these effects to all orders to analyze inclusive decay rates.

Result: Found that inclusive decay rates of unstable particles are unchanged by gravitational waves, indicating that their mutual transparency arises from infrared safety rather than a balance at leading order.

Conclusion: Concludes that gravitational waves and matter remain mutually transparent primarily due to infrared safety mechanisms, not a coincidental cancellation at leading-order approximations, thus revising prior understandings of gravitational wave behavior.

Abstract: Gravitational waves are thought to propagate unattenuated through matter due
to a cancellation between graviton absorption and stimulated emission inferred
from leading-order soft-graviton arguments. We revisit this reasoning and show
that it fails for the converse problem: the effect of a gravitational-wave
background on matter. For unstable particles, real graviton emission \emph{and}
absorption appear to enhance decay rates. By extending the soft-graviton
framework describing real and virtual processes in a gravitational wave
background, and resumming them to all orders, we show that inclusive decay
rates remain essentially unchanged. The mutual transparency between matter and
gravitational radiation thus follows from infrared safety, and not from a
fortuitous cancellation in the lowest-order approximation of exclusive rates.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We examine theoretical uncertainties in state-of-the-art calculations of the
bubble wall velocity during first-order cosmological phase transitions. By
utilising the software WallGo for two extensions of the Standard Model, we find
several $\mathcal{O}(1)$ uncertainties arising from the number of particles
taken out of equilibrium, the logarithmically and power enhanced collision
integrals, the treatment of thermal masses, the nucleation temperature, the
$\tanh$ ansatz, and the perturbative order of the effective potential. However,
we show that the linearisation of the Boltzmann equations is generally a good
approximation with much smaller associated errors. We further clarify the
limitations of the quasiparticle approximation in regions with negative mass
squared. This study provides a detailed uncertainty budget and highlights where
future efforts should be directed to improve the reliability of wall velocity
and hence gravitational wave predictions.
