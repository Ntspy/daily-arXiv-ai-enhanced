We study the prospects for\ndetecting axions through this method and identify two key characteristics that\nresult in compelling detection sensitivity. First, the gradient of the\ngenerated axion field can be substantial, set by the inverse distance from the\nsource. In the near zone, it reduces to the inverse of the source's geometric\nsize. Second, because the generated axion field is produced at a known\nfrequency, the detection medium can be tuned precisely to this frequency,\nenabling long interrogation times. We show that the experimental sensitivity of\na pair of centimeter-scale NMR devices operating over a 15-day integration time\ncan already surpass existing astrophysical bounds on the axion-nucleon\ncoupling. A similar sensitivity can be achieved with 10 centimeter-scale NMR\ndevices with only 1 hour of integration time.

However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like\nexoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter\nin galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6--8 meter\nlarge-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable\nWorlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect\nrocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider\nhere the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated\nastrometric instrument on HWO.

A\nsignificant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid\nvariations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the\narray, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated\nsignal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable\nsensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based\nphase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We\nadopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these\nphase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly\nerratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman\nfiltering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions,\nwhich permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space. Our model\nalso removes the need to specify an arbitrary ``reference station'' during\ncalibration, instead establishing a global phase zeropoint by enforcing the GPs\nat all stations to have fixed mean and finite variance. We validate our method\nusing a real EHT observation of the blazar 3C 279, demonstrating that our\napproach yields calibration solutions that are consistent with those determined\nby the EHT Collaboration.

However, at\n$T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the\nsame interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet\nwith a half-opening angle of $\\theta_j=11.5^{\\circ}$ through a refreshed shock\npowered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The\nburst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the\nAmati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling\nof the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$),\nwhich is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the\nclassification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the\nprompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and\nunderscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the\nimportance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations."}

We\npresent a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using\ntheir spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across\ncosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated\nwith three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries\nembedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For\nmergers at redshift $z \\lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering\nsignatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current\nground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Using mock catalogs for next-\ngeneration facilities such as Cosmic Explorer, we find that their sensitivities\nwould enable differentiation of these formation pathways out to redshift $z\n\\sim 5$ within the first decade of observations.

Using simulations the study tracks how sudden\naccretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop)\nduring which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains\nnearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition\nbetween two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion,\nand how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that\nboosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest\neffect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the\nregion of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In\nparticular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion,\nlasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce\nthe superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In\ncontrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause\ntemporary changes in the black hole spin.

We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by\nanalysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona\ncondensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that\nthe accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission\nspectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of\ncold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington\nvalue, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the\nfraction of cold gas supply.

Since an\n$X_{\\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this\nimplies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF\nshape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\\rm max}$ dependence can be explained\nin terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes\nwith $(1/\\rho)^J$, where $\\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\\rm max}$ and $J$ is\na zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density\nscaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other\nscaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\\rm max}$ to the\ncore at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper\nshowers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to\nlarger measured electric fields as $X_{\\rm max}$ increases. The picture at\nhigher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the\ndeflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time\ndelays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.\nThis loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic\nfield and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission\nwith decreasing air density.

Interestingly, these\nobservations are consistent with earlier results from the Large\nElectron-Positron (LEP) collider, which pointed to an excess in $b\\bar b$ final\nstates within a similar mass range. Additionally, CMS has observed an excess in\nthe $\\gamma\\gamma b\\bar{b}$ final state, indicating a possible resonance near\n650 GeV decaying into a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons or into a SM-like Higgs\nboson accompanied by a lighter scalar with mass near 95 GeV. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether these anomalies can be simultaneously explained within the\nNext-to-2-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM), an extension of the Standard Model (SM)\nscalar sector featuring two complex Higgs doublets and an additional real\nsinglet. Assuming the existence of a CP-even Higgs state compatible with the 95\nGeV excesses (restricted to the $\\gamma\\gamma$ and $b\\bar b$ channels), we\nanalyse the Type-II and Type-Y Yukawa structures, taking the observed 650 GeV\nresonance to be a CP-even Higgs state. An extensive parameter scan is\nperformed, incorporating the latest constraints. Our results show that a heavy\nCP-even Higgs resonance around 650 GeV, produced predominantly via gluon-gluon\nfusion and subsequently decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs boson together with\nanother scalar at approximately 95 GeV, can be simultaneously accommodated\nwithin both the N2HDM Type-II and Type-Y frameworks at a significance level of\n2$\\sigma$. This interpretation leads to distinctive and testable predictions\nfrom the N2HDM for the ongoing LHC Run-3 and the forthcoming High-Luminosity\nLHC (HL-LHC) phase."}

However, a major\nobservational challenge lies in the need for well-sampled, temporally uniform\ndata, which is often hindered by irregular sampling and data gaps. These gaps\ncan significantly affect the reliability and accuracy of methods used to probe\nsource variability. This paper investigates the impact of such observational\ngaps on time series analysis of blazar emissions. To do so, we systematically\nevaluate how these gaps alter observed variability patterns, mask genuine\nperiodic signals, and introduce false periodicity detections. This evaluation\nis conducted using both simulated and real observational data. We assess a\nrange of widely used time series analysis methods, including the Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and the recently proposed Singular\nSpectrum Analysis (SSA). Our results demonstrate a clear and significant\ndegradation in period detection reliability when the percentage of gaps exceeds\n50\\%. In such cases, the period-significance relationship becomes increasingly\ndistorted, often leading to misleading results. Among the tested methods, SSA\nstands out for its ability to yield consistent and robust detections despite\nhigh data incompleteness. Additionally, the analyzed methods tend to identify\nartificial periodicities of around one year, likely due to seasonal sampling\neffects, which can result in false positives if not carefully recognized.\nFinally, the periods detected with $\\geq$3$\\sigma$ confidence are unlikely to\nresult from stochastic processes or from the presence of gaps in the analyzed\ntime series."}

Another notable\ncandidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a\npotential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this\nsource returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated\nby two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and\nIC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV,\nimplying a maximum proton energy > 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC\n1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino\nspectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT\nobservations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade\nflux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV\nflux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the\nneutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons\nare accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the\ncorona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and\nX-rays from the corona through the $p\\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with\nenergy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required\nmaximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to\nunity ($\\sigma\\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization\nparameter with $\\sigma\\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated\ncomposition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino\nspectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different\nmagnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN."}

Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor\nfield evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other\nself-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model.
