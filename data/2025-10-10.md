### [2] [Probing the Origin of Water in Planets within Habitable Zones by HWO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07349)
*Yasuhiro Hasegawa,Courtney Dressing,Ludmila Carone*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The abstract explores how planets in habitable zones obtain water and challenges the traditional Jupiter-like hypothesis, proposing that planet formation dynamics in protoplanetary disks play a key role. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to test two hypotheses about the correlation between water abundance on Earth-like planets and the presence of outer planets by identifying necessary measurements and observational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the formation and evolution of habitable environments, specifically addressing how water is delivered to planets in habitable zones. The traditional Jupiter shake-up hypothesis is questioned in light of new dynamic planet formation models involving processes like pebble drift and migration.

Method: Proposing two hypotheses about water abundance correlation with outer planets. Discusses required physical parameters to differentiate the hypotheses and outlines observational capabilities needed for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to test them.

Result: No specific results yet, as this is a proposal for the HWO's observational strategy and required parameters to investigate the hypotheses.

Conclusion: The HWO will provide critical data to determine the role of outer planets in water delivery to habitable zone planets, advancing our understanding of planetary habitability through targeted measurements and advanced observational tools.

Abstract: How do habitable environments arise and evolve within the context of their
planetary systems? This is one fundamental question, and it can be addressed
partly by identifying how planets in habitable zones obtain water.
Historically, astronomers considered that water was delivered to the Earth via
dynamical shake-up by Jupiter, which took place during the formation and
post-formation eras (e.g., $\lesssim 100$ Myr). This hypothesis has recently
been challenged by a more dynamic view of planet formation; planet-forming
materials move in protoplanetary disks via various physical processes such as
pebble drift and planetary migration. \textit{Habitable Worlds Observatory}
(HWO) will open a new window to address this important, but difficult question
by discovering and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets around G-type stars. In
this article, we consider two possible working hypotheses: (1) the abundance of
water on planets in habitable zones has \textit{any} correlation with the
presence of outer planets; and (2) the abundance of water on planets in
habitable zones has \textit{no} correlation with the presence of outer planets.
We discuss what physical parameters need to be measured to differentiate these
two hypotheses and what observational capabilities are desired for HWO to
reliably constrain these physical parameters.

### [3] [Photometric Redshift Estimation for Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 with Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07370)
*T. Zhang,E. Charles,J. F. Crenshaw,S. J. Schmidt,P. Adari,J. Gschwend,S. Mau,B. Andrews,E. Aubourg,Y. Bains,K. Bechtol,A. Boucaud,D. Boutigny,P. Burchat,J. Chevalier,J. Chiang,H. -F. Chiang,D.

Utsumi,W. van Reeven,A. von der Linden,C. W. Walter,W. M. Wood-Vasey,J. Zuntz,LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic analysis of photometric redshifts (photo-z) using Rubin Observatory DP1 data with the RAIL framework. Eight algorithms were applied to two fields, achieving σNMAD ~0.03 and 10% outlier fractions, meeting LSST Y1 requirements. Near-infrared data from Euclid improves photo-z at higher redshifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to validate the RAIL pipeline for Rubin Observatory's photo-z production and assess the performance of various algorithms under real data conditions, while exploring the benefits of integrating Euclid mission's near-infrared data.

Method: Using RAIL, eight photo-z algorithms were applied to DP1 data from ECDFS (6-band) and Rubin_SV_38_7 (4-band) fields. A reference catalog combining spec-z, grism-z, and multiband photo-z was used for training/validation. Performance was evaluated against spec-z from ECDFS and DESI DR1 samples.

Result: Achieved σNMAD ~0.03 and ~10% outlier fractions in 6-band data, though performance declines at faint magnitudes and z>1.2. Machine learning photo-z meets LSST Y1 requirements. Euclid's near-infrared data enhances photo-z accuracy at z>1.2.

Conclusion: RAIL pipeline is validated for Rubin's photo-z production. Current performance meets initial requirements but shows room for improvement at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes. Integration with Euclid data offers significant benefits for future high-redshift studies.

Abstract: We present the first systematic analysis of photometric redshifts (photo-z)
estimated from the Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) data taken with the
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Commissioning Camera. Employing the
Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL) framework, we apply eight
photo-z algorithms to the DP1 photometry, using deep ugrizy coverage in the
Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) field and griz data in the
Rubin_SV_38_7 field. In the ECDFS field, we construct a reference catalog from
spectroscopic redshift (spec-z), grism redshift (grism-z), and multiband
photo-z for training and validating photo-z. Performance metrics of the photo-z
are evaluated using spec-zs from ECDFS and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
Data Release 1 samples. Across the algorithms, we achieve per-galaxy photo-z
scatter of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.03$ and outlier fractions around 10% in
the 6-band data, with performance degrading at faint magnitudes and z>1.2. The
overall bias and scatter of our machine-learning based photo-zs satisfy the
LSST Y1 requirement. We also use our photo-z to infer the ensemble redshift
distribution n(z). We study the photo-z improvement by including near-infrared
photometry from the Euclid mission, and find that Euclid photometry improves
photo-z at z>1.2. Our results validate the RAIL pipeline for Rubin photo-z
production and demonstrate promising initial performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: JWST's exquisite data have opened the doors to new possibilities in detecting
broad classes of astronomical objects, but also to new challenges in
classifying those objects. In this work, we introduce SESHAT, the Stellar
Evolutionary Stage Heuristic Assessment Tool for the identification of Young
Stellar Objects, field stars (main sequence through asymptotic giant branch),
brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, and galaxies, from any JWST observation. This
identification is done using the machine learning method XGBoost to analyze
thousands of rows of synthetic photometry, modified at run-time to match the
filters available in the data to be classified. We validate this tool on real
data of both star-forming regions and cosmological fields, and find we are able
to reproduce the observed classes of objects to a minimum of 80\% recall across
every class, without additional information on the ellipticity or spatial
distribution of the objects. Furthermore, this tool can be used to test the
filter choices for JWST proposals, to verify whether the chosen filters are
sufficient to identify the desired class of objects. SESHAT is released as a
Python package to the community for general use.

### [5] [FlowLensing: Simulating Gravitational Lensing with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07878)
*Hamees Sayed,Pranath Reddy,Michael W. Toomey,Sergei Gleyzer*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based model, simulates gravitational lensing with 200x speedup over classical methods, enabling scalable dark matter studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lensing simulation tools are too slow for large-scale studies, hindering dark matter research, especially in analyzing substructures through cosmological surveys.

Method: FlowLensing employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture using flow-matching in discrete/continuous regimes to generate physically consistent lensed images efficiently.

Result: Achieves over 200x speed increase compared to traditional methods while maintaining high fidelity and low latency, suitable for intensive dark matter models.

Conclusion: FlowLensing provides a scalable, rapid alternative to classical simulators, advancing dark matter substructure analysis in upcoming cosmological surveys.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet
creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing
tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise,
are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based
compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing
simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes,
handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous
model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable
simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for
probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our
model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators
for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency.
FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis,
offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.

### [6] [Mephisto: Self-Improving Large Language Model-Based Agents for Automated Interpretation of Multi-band Galaxy Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08354)
*Zechang Sun,Yuan-Sen Ting,Yaobo Liang,Nan Duan,Song Huang,Zheng Cai*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Mephisto is a multi-agent framework using LLMs to emulate human reasoning for analyzing galaxy data, offering transparent and collaborative scientific workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Astronomy traditionally depends on human expertise, but Mephisto aims to automate and enhance this process by providing a transparent, human-like reasoning system that integrates with existing tools like CIGALE, moving beyond opaque machine learning methods.

Method: Mephisto uses LLMs to collaborate through multi-agent interactions, interfaces with CIGALE's SED models, employs tree search for reasoning, self-play for knowledge accumulation, and dynamic knowledge updates to refine galaxy property inferences from multi-band data.

Result: Successfully tested on various galaxies, including JWST's 'Little Red Dot' galaxies, demonstrating accurate physical property inferences and potential as an AI research tool for astronomers.

Conclusion: This work shows LLM-driven agents can facilitate automated scientific workflows, enabling AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy while maintaining transparency and alignment with human research practices.

Abstract: Astronomical research has long relied on human expertise to interpret complex
data and formulate scientific hypotheses. In this study, we introduce Mephisto
-- a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models
(LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy
observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of
spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical
models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree
search, accumulates knowledge through self-play, and dynamically updates its
knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations -- including the
James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered "Little Red Dot" galaxies --
we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical
properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a
promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine
learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned
reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices.
This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for
astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial
intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for
AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spectroscopy represents the ideal observational method to maximally extract
information from galaxies regarding their star formation and chemical
enrichment histories. However, absorption spectra of galaxies prove rather
challenging at high redshift or in low mass galaxies, due to the need to spread
the photons into a relatively large set of spectral bins. For this reason, the
data from many state-of-the-art spectroscopic surveys suffer from low
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, and prevent accurate estimates of the stellar
population parameters. In this paper, we tackle the issue of denoising an
ensemble by the use of unsupervised Deep Learning techniques trained on a
homogeneous sample of spectra over a wide range of S/N. These methods
reconstruct spectra at a higher S/N and allow us to investigate the potential
for Deep Learning to faithfully reproduce spectra from incomplete data. Our
methodology is tested on three key line strengths and is compared with
synthetic data to assess retrieval biases. The results suggest a standard
Autoencoder as a very powerful method that does not introduce systematics in
the reconstruction. We also note in this work how careful the analysis needs to
be, as other methods can -- on a quick check -- produce spectra that appear
noiseless but are in fact strongly biased towards a simple overfitting of the
noisy input. Denoising methods with minimal bias will maximise the quality of
ongoing and future spectral surveys such as DESI, WEAVE, or WAVES.

### [8] [Axion Quality Problem: Keep Calm and Baryon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07366)
*Prateek Agrawal,Anson Hook,Vazha Loladze,Mario Reig*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple model with a high-quality axion by utilizing a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB) of the baryon number symmetry in a supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) framework. This model solves the axion quality problem by protecting the axion's shift symmetry through the high dimensionality of gauge-invariant baryon operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Axion models typically face a 'quality problem' when coupled to gravity, which restricts their viability. The authors aim to construct a model where the axion has a sufficiently high quality factor to overcome this issue, ensuring the axion can effectively address the strong CP problem without violating observational constraints.

Method: The authors model the axion as a PNGB of spontaneously broken U(1)_B symmetry in a new composite sector that confines. They use SQCD with N_c = N_f as a controlled example, where the shift symmetry protection arises naturally from the baryon operator's high dimension (N_c+2). The Standard Model gauge group is embedded in the SQCD flavor symmetry to generate the necessary axial anomaly coupling to gluons.

Result: The model successfully achieves a high-quality axion by suppressing dimension-operators that would otherwise break the shift symmetry. This eliminates the quality problem in the presence of gravity, making the axion viable as a solution to the strong CP problem without conflicting with experimental observations.

Conclusion: The proposed SQCD-based axion model provides a compelling framework to address both the strong CP problem and the axion quality issue. It leverages the natural suppression of symmetry-breaking operators through the structure of confined gauge theories, offering a theoretically robust solution.

Abstract: Axion models generically suffer from a severe quality problem when coupled to
gravity. In this article we provide a very simple model with a high quality
axion. The axion is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the baryon number
symmetry, $U(1)_B$, of a new composite sector that breaks $U(1)_B$
spontaneously when it confines. A controlled example is a supersymmetric QCD
(SQCD) with $N_c = N_f$. The axion shift symmetry is automatically protected
due to the high dimension of the gauge-invariant baryon operator, with the
Peccei-Quinn breaking operators arising at dimension $N_c+2$. The standard
model gauge group is embedded as a subgroup of the flavor symmetry group of
SQCD that has an anomaly with $U(1)_B$, generating the standard coupling with
gluons.

### [9] [Axion Perturbations: A General Analytical Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07371)
*Itamar J. Allali,Priyesh Chakraborty,JiJi Fan,Matthew Reece*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the universal principles governing the perturbations in axion dark matter across various cosmological backgrounds, demonstrating that these perturbations are determined by super-horizon scale dynamics and background solutions, independent of specific assumptions like radiation domination or quadratic potentials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify understanding of axion dark matter perturbations across diverse cosmological scenarios, addressing how axions develop adiabatic perturbations and how their isocurvature power spectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the universe's background evolution without relying on prior restrictive assumptions.

Method: Analyzes the axion field equations on super-horizon scales for a general cosmological background and temperature-dependent potential, deriving solutions for both isocurvature and curvature perturbations components. Leverages Weinberg's theorem on adiabatic modes to ensure general applicability.

Result: Shows that the axion field's super-horizon solutions are entirely determined by background dynamics driven by initial field values, with perturbations emerging from sensitivities in DM abundance to initial conditions. Validates universality independent of assumptions like radiation domination.

Conclusion: Establishes a general framework for predicting axion dark matter perturbations applicable to any cosmological scenario, emphasizing the role of initial conditions and Weinberg's theorem in ensuring adiabatic perturbations without requiring specific background conditions.

Abstract: Cosmological data provides us two key constraints on dark matter (DM): it
must have a particular abundance, and it must have an adiabatic spectrum of
density perturbations in the early universe. Many different cosmological
scenarios have been proposed that establish the abundance of axion DM in
qualitatively different ways. In this paper we emphasize that, despite this
variety of backgrounds, the perturbations in axion DM can be understood from
universal principles. How does a feebly interacting axion field acquire
perturbations proportional to those of photons? How do the isocurvature power
spectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the background evolution of the
universe? We answer these questions for a completely general choice of
cosmological background and temperature-dependent axion potential. We show that
the most general solution to the axion field equation on super-horizon scales
is entirely determined by the family of background solutions for different
initial field values $\theta_{\rm ini}$. This holds for both the component in
the field perturbation solution contributing to the DM isocurvature
perturbation (enhanced at late times by the sensitivity of the DM abundance to
the initial condition, $\partial \Omega_a / \partial \theta_{\rm ini}$, which
can be large for initial conditions near the hilltop), and the other component
that contributes to the DM curvature perturbation. In particular, we explain
that an unperturbed axion field in the early universe evolving into one with
nontrivial adiabatic perturbations is guaranteed by Weinberg's theorem on
adiabatic modes. These results have been derived before with various
assumptions, such as a radiation dominated background or a quadratic potential.
Our aim is to give a clear, simple derivation that is manifestly independent of
those assumptions, and thus can be applied to any cosmological axion scenario.

Abstract: Stars orbiting Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center provide a unique laboratory
to test gravity and dark matter (DM). We demonstrate that DM interactions in
stellar interiors induce a novel momentum transfer force, altering orbits
beyond gravitational effects. Using S2's 2000-2019 orbital data we derive the
first astrophysical constraints on DM-nucleon scattering, excluding new sub-GeV
parameter space. Stellar lifetime constraints over Myr timescales complement
these, surpassing some direct detection and cosmological limits. This
establishes stellar dynamics as a novel probe of DM interactions.

*Lasse Lorentz Braseth,Tore Klungland,Are Raklev*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper evaluates next-to-leading power contributions in threshold variable at leading logarithmic accuracy for inclusive slepton pair production at hadron colliders, finding they significantly affect scale errors, especially for large slepton masses, and provides results for FCC-hh at 85 TeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current calculations focus on higher-order logarithms at leading power but neglect next-to-leading power terms, which may impact accuracy, particularly for heavy slepton masses. Resumming these terms is crucial for precise predictions at threshold energies.

Method: The authors analyze the next-to-leading power contributions in the threshold variable and resum them to leading logarithmic accuracy, comparing their effects to existing leading power next-to-leading logarithmic terms.

Result: Next-to-leading power contributions are found significant compared to next-to-leading logarithmic terms at leading power, leading to underestimation of scale errors for large slepton masses. Results for FCC-hh at 85 TeV show improved precision.

Conclusion: Including next-to-leading power terms is essential for accurate predictions, especially at high masses, and current error estimates require reassessment. These findings are critical for future collider experiments like FCC-hh.

Abstract: Near threshold, cross sections for the production of heavy particles are
sensitive to large logarithmic terms, which must be resummed to all orders in
perturbation theory. Current state-of-the art calculations for inclusive
slepton pair production at hadron colliders has focused on higher-order
logarithms in the leading power of the threshold variable. Here, we evaluate
the next-to-leading power contribution in the threshold variable to leading
logarithmic accuracy. We find that the next-to-leading power contributions can
be significant compared to the next-to-leading logarithmic terms at leading
power, and that existing calculations underestimate the scale error for large
slepton masses. We include results for a potential future FCC-hh machine at
$\sqrt{s}=85$ TeV.

### [12] [Sterile neutrino dark matter from a TeV Scale Seesaw](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07433)
*Kunal Pandey,Suhail Khan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a feebly interacting sterile neutrino as dark matter in a modified Type-I seesaw model with an additional scalar doublet, enabling a broad mass range for the sterile neutrino and compatibility with both warm and cold dark matter scenarios through Lyman-alpha forest data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dark matter problem by investigating a sterile neutrino FIMP produced via W/Z boson decays in a low-scale seesaw framework, while expanding parameter space and considering observational constraints.

Method: Extended Type-I seesaw model with an extra scalar doublet coupling to right-handed neutrinos, analyzing relic abundance via W/Z decay contributions, and comparing with Lyman-alpha forest observations.

Result: Sterile neutrino masses from sub-keV to 0.2 GeV are possible, with the model accommodating both warm and cold dark matter options under Lyman-alpha constraints.

Conclusion: The model successfully offers a viable dark matter candidate within a low-scale seesaw framework, highlighting the importance of W/Z-mediated production and scalar doublet's small vev in broadening allowed parameter space.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the phenomenological aspects of a feebly
interacting sterile neutrino dark matter in a low-scale seesaw setup. The
Type-I seesaw framework is augmented by a second complex scalar doublet
($\Phi_{\nu}$), which couples exclusively with the heavy right-handed neutrinos
and the lepton doublet, thereby forming the neutrino Dirac mass term, while the
first doublet is responsible for the mass generation of the remaining Standard
Model particles. The lightest sterile neutrino ($N_1$) serves as a feebly
interacting massive particle (FIMP), produced primarily through W and Z boson
decays -a previously overlooked dominant contribution that solely determines
the relic abundance. Owing to the small vev ($v_{\nu}\sim 10$ MeV) of the
second Higgs doublet, an enhancement in the available parameter space of the
sterile neutrino masses is observed, spanning from sub-keV to $0.2$ GeV. After
incorporating the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations it is found that
the setup is able to accommodate both warm and cold dark matter options.

### [13] [Charged scalar bosons under rotation and acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07438)
*M. Bordag,D. N. Voskresensky*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the creation of charged spinless bosons from vacuum in rotating frames with external electromagnetic fields, showing that a supervortex forms when rotation exceeds a critical frequency. It also explores the effect of accelerated frames, finding that negative acceleration can enable vortex formation even with vanishing fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand particle creation mechanisms in rotating systems under electromagnetic influences and analyze how acceleration modifies these processes.

Method: The study uses quantum field theory in rotating frames, analyzing scenarios with solenoids in rotating cylinders, with or without electric potentials. Specific cases, like accelerated frames with $w(r)=G/r$, are solved explicitly.

Result: Critical rotation frequency for boson creation decreases when solenoids are stationary in the resting frame. For accelerated frames with $G<0$, vortices form even as electromagnetic fields approach zero.

Conclusion: Rotation and acceleration significantly influence charged boson production, with acceleration direction determining feasibility even under weak field conditions.

Abstract: Creation of charged spinless bosons from vacuum in the rigidly rotating frame
is studied in presence of the external static electromagnetic fields, being
formed either in the resting, or in the general rotating or in the local-flat
frames. It is shown that the description remains the same in the resting and
the local-flat frames. More specifically, the case of a solenoid (magnetic flux
tube) embedded into the rotating empty cylinder (rotation frame) is studied in
presence or absence of a static square electric potential well $eA_0$. A
supervortex of a spinless-boson field can be created from vacuum when the
rotation frequency exceeds a critical value $\Omega_c$. It is shown that
$\Omega_c$ is smaller provided the solenoid rests in the resting frame. Then
the case is considered when the rotating frame additionally moves with
acceleration $\vec{w}(\vec{r})\neq 0$. A specific case $w(r)=G/r$ for $G=const$
is treated explicitly. It is shown that for $G<0$ the charged spinless-boson
vortex can be created in rapidly rotating system even in the limit when the
magnetic and electric fields tend to zero.

Abstract: High-energy physics experiments studying neutrinos rely heavily on
simulations of their interactions with atomic nuclei. Limitations in the
theoretical understanding of these interactions typically necessitate ad hoc
tuning of simulation model parameters to data. Traditional tuning methods for
neutrino experiments have largely relied on simple algorithms for numerical
optimization. While adequate for the modest goals of initial efforts, the
complexity of future neutrino tuning campaigns is expected to increase
substantially, and new approaches will be needed to make progress. In this
paper, we examine the application of simulation-based inference (SBI) to the
neutrino interaction model tuning for the first time. Using a previous tuning
study performed by the MicroBooNE experiment as a test case, we find that our
SBI algorithm can correctly infer the tuned parameter values when confronted
with a mock data set generated according to the MicroBooNE procedure. This
initial proof-of-principle illustrates a promising new technique for
next-generation simulation tuning campaigns for the neutrino experimental
community.

which shift the gravitational metric by an additional rank-2 tensor. This
tensor can in principle be constructed from scalar-field gradients, vector
fields, or field-strength contractions. We show this transformation results in
the conventional Dirac action being modified by additional kinetic and
axial-current couplings that are quadratic in the shifted field. When the field
sourcing the metric shift takes on a non-trivial background value, apparent
Lorentz-violating effects can result, which we identify as terms in an
effective field theory. Assuming the well-motivated cases of scalar and vector
ultralight dark matter, we demonstrate that experimental tests of rotation and
boost violation imply constraints on the additional kinetic coupling. Even
under conservative assumptions, the constraints for vector ultralight dark
matter are extremely stringent.

Abstract: This study investigates the Higgs rare decays $h^0\rightarrow Z\gamma,V Z$
within the next to minimum B-L supersymmetric model(NB-LSSM), where $V$
represents a vector meson $(\phi,J/\psi,\Upsilon(1S),\rho^0,\omega)$. Compared
to the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM), the NB-LSSM introduces
three singlet Higgs superfields, which mix with the Higgs doublets and affect
the lightest Higgs boson mass and the Higgs couplings. The loop-induced
contributions resulting from the effective $h^0Z\gamma$ coupling can produce
new physics(NP) contributions, thereby affecting the theoretical predictions of
rare decays significantly through the new parameters such as $\kappa$,
$\lambda$, $\lambda_2\cdot\cdot\cdot$. The results of this work can provide a
reference for probing NP beyond standard model(SM).

*Luis Gabriel Gallegos Mariñez,Lizardo Valencia Palomo,Luis Cedillo Barrera*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the mean transverse momentum of Upsilon particles in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV using Pythia simulations, finding better agreement with CMS data for excited states than the ground state. The study highlights contributions from the away region and jet fragmentation effects, proposing a method to validate quarkonia shower models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately describing quarkonia production in QCD by comparing Pythia simulations with CMS data, understanding state-dependent effects and momentum dependencies.

Method: Simulated proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV using Pythia 8.312 CUETP8M1 tune; analyzed mean pT of Upsilon(1S, 2S, 3S) as a function of charged track multiplicity. Compared to CMS data, evaluated contributions from away regions, jetty vs. isotropic events, and jet fragmentation.

Result: Agreement between Pythia and data is better for excited Upsilon states. Mean pT increases rapidly at low track multiplicities due to the away region. Jetty events show pT hardening, and a method for testing quarkonia shower models via jet fragmentation analysis is proposed.

Conclusion: Pythia's performance varies across Upsilon states, indicating room for model improvement. The away region and jet dynamics significantly influence pT. The proposed fragmentation-based method offers a new validation approach for quarkonia shower models in MC generators.

Abstract: Correct description of quarkonia production and kinematics are still one of
the most challenging assignments for Quantum Chromodynamics. This document
presents a study of the $\Upsilon$(1S), (2S) and (3S) mean transverse momentum
($\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\Upsilon} \rangle$) as a function of the charged
particle multiplicity ($N_{\mathrm{Track}}$) in proton-proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV generated with Pythia 8.312 CUETP8M1 tune. The comparison to
real data collected by the CMS experiment indicates that the agreement is much
better for the excited states than for the ground state. The observed fast
increase of the $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\Upsilon} \rangle$ at small values of
$N_{\mathrm{Track}}$ is mainly due to the contribution from the away region.
Furthermore, when computing the $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\Upsilon} \rangle$
from jetty and isotropic events a clear $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ hardening is observed
in jetty events. Finally, analyzing the fragmentation of jets containing an
$\Upsilon$(nS) it is proposed a method to test the new quarkonia shower present
in the Monte Carlo event generator.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines light tetraquark states using a non-relativistic quark model with two confinement potentials, Cornell and linear, alongside meson exchange and instanton-induced interactions. It confirms the masses of numerous tetraquark candidates, supporting their identification and guiding future searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate low-lying light tetraquark states and validate their existence through spectral analysis using established quark model frameworks, providing guidance for experimental detection.

Method: Employed non-relativistic quark model with pseudoscalar meson exchange, two confinement potentials (Cornell and linear), and instanton-induced interactions to calculate tetraquark masses.

Result: Computed masses align with experimental data of multiple tetraquark candidates like $f_{0}(500)$, $a_{0}(980)$, and others, confirming their tetraquark nature.

Conclusion: The model successfully explains the meson spectra, strengthens tetraquark interpretations of observed states, and advises experimental efforts to locate additional tetraquarks.

Abstract: The low-lying light tetraquark states are investigated in the
non-relativistic quark model (NRQM) including the pseudoscalar meson exchange,
where two different confinement potential schemes, the Cornell potential and
the linear potential, are employed, along with the instanton-induced
interaction serving as the residual spin-dependent interaction. The numerical
results show agreement with masses of $f_{0}(500)$, $f_{0}(1370)$,
$f_{0}(1500)$, $f_{0}(2020)$, $f_{0}(2200)$, $h_{1}(1170)$, $h_{1}(1595)$,
$h_{1}(1900)$, $h_{1}(1965)$, $h_{1}(2215)$, $f_{2}(1430)$, $f_{2}(1640)$,

$K^{*}_{0}(1950)$, $K_{1}(1270)$, $K_{1}(1440)$, $K_{1}(1650)$, and
$K^{*}_{2}(1980)$. The results shed light on the spectrum of these mesons and
offer guidande to search for the tetraquarks in the future.

### [19] [Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894)
*Yukihiro Kanda,Naoya Kitajima*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that semilocal cosmic strings in the early universe efficiently produce massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which could form warm dark matter if they later acquire mass through symmetry-breaking terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how semilocal cosmic strings, formed during symmetry breaking phases in the early universe, contribute to particle production that might explain dark matter phenomena.

Method: Numerical simulations of semilocal string network evolution were conducted to analyze the production and spectral characteristics of emitted Nambu-Goldstone bosons.

Result: The simulations show a significant production of NG bosons with a momentum spectrum peaking at low values corresponding to the cosmic horizon scale.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that NG bosons from semilocal strings, if mass-acquired post-production, could constitute warm dark matter with very light particle masses.

Abstract: Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated
with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry
to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry. The broken phase has two massless
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes as dynamical fields, and they can be emitted by
semilocal strings. In this paper, we numerically show that such NG bosons are
copiously produced with the evolution of the semilocal string network in the
early universe. Our numerical analysis shows that the spectrum of produced
particles has a peak at low momenta corresponding to the horizon scale. If the
emitted NG bosons acquire mass due to soft-breaking terms, they can take the
role of dark matter. This scenario typically predicts very light pseudo NG
boson dark matter.

Abstract: The existence of cosmic fields made from yet unknown light bosons is
predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model. They are especially of
interest as possible constituents of dark matter. To detect such light and
weakly interacting fields, atomic precision measurements offer one of the most
sensitive platforms. In this work, we derive which atomic observables are
sensitive to what kind of cosmic field couplings. For this we consider fields
that couple either through scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, or
tensor couplings. We derive the corresponding non relativistic atomic
potentials. Based on their symmetry properties, these can induce direct energy
shifts or induce atomic electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole
as well as nuclear Schiff and anapole moments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement at the colliders which is independent of
the spin-analyzing powers. Taking $\Lambda(\to p\pi^-)\bar{\Lambda}(\to
\bar{p}\pi^+)$ as an example, we investigate whether quantum entanglement in
fermion pairs produced at colliders can be certified by using only angular
information from final-state decays, while remaining independent of the
parity-violating decay parameters $\alpha_\Lambda$ and
$\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$. Building on a general decomposition of any angular
observable in terms of Wigner d-functions, we show that the expectation value
must take the form
$\mathcal{O}_0+\mathcal{O}_1\alpha_\Lambda+\mathcal{O}_2\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}+\mathcal{O}_3\alpha_\Lambda\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$,
with coefficients $\mathcal{O}_i$ ($i=0,1,2,3$) linear in the spin-density
matrix elements $\alpha_{k,j}\alpha^*_{m,n}$. We obtain the value ranges of
observables over the general and separable spaces of $\alpha_{k,j}$, and
demonstrate a sufficient entanglement condition for pure states, extending it
to mixed states by convexity. In constructing an $\alpha_\Lambda$- and
$\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$-independent witness from angular observables alone, we
find that there are obstacles to probe quantum entanglement via the
inequality-type and ratio-type ways. Finally, we present the successful
constructions with additional spin information: for the process of $e^+e^-\to
J/\Psi\to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ at $e^+ e^-$ collider, independent spin
information provided by beam-axis selection enables the construction of
normalized observables $f_i~(i=1,2)$ that are insensitive to $\alpha_\Lambda$
and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$; if their measured values lie in
$\left[-1,-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\cup\left(\tfrac{1}{2},1\right]$, entanglement is
certified, irrespective of purity or mixedness.

### [22] [Neutrinoless double beta decay in a supersymmetric left-right model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08090)
*Vivek Banerjee,Sasmita Mishra*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study explores the impact of a supersymmetric left-right model on neutrinoless double beta decay (
0νββ
), finding that the parity-breaking scale
M
R
must exceed 1 TeV and could be pushed beyond 4-5 TeV by future experiments. Dark matter candidates like the lightest neutralino and sneutrino significantly influence the decay half-life, indicating potential detectability in upcoming experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate how the supersymmetric left-right model affects
0νββ
decay, which is a key probe for Majorana neutrinos and new physics beyond the Standard Model. This study aims to explore the interplay between low-energy phenomena and high-energy scales like
M
R
, as well as the role of dark matter candidates in the decay process.

Method: The decay amplitude is formulated via effective field theory, separating long- and short-range contributions. These are expressed using dimensionless particle physics parameters and nuclear matrix elements to analyze sensitivity to
M
R
and dark matter particles.

Result: The analysis establishes a lower bound of 1 TeV for
M
R
, with future experiments potentially extending this to 4-5 TeV. Dark matter candidates (neutralino and sneutrino) were found to contribute significantly to the decay's half-life.

Conclusion: Detection of supersymmetric particles in future experiments could validate the role of dark matter candidates in such models. The study underscores
0νββ
decay's utility in linking low-energy observations with high-energy physics scales and new particle discovery.

Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, an important low-energy
process, serves not only as a potential test of the Majorana nature of
neutrinos, but also as a sensitive probe for new physics beyond the Standard
Model. In this study, the supersymmetric left-right model is explored to
investigate its impact on $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Although the process takes
place at low energies as compared to the electroweak scale, it carries the
potential to provide indirect hints about the parity-breaking scale
$\text{M}_R$. In this work, we formulate the decay amplitude using an effective
field theory approach by separating long- and short-range contributions, each
expressed in terms of dimensionless particle physics parameters and nuclear
matrix elements. The analysis shows that the $\text{M}_R$ must lie above $1$
TeV, and future experiments may push it beyond $4 - 5$ TeV region. Another
important outcome of this work is the role played by the tentative dark matter
candidates, the lightest neutralino and sneutrino, which contribute
significantly to the half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. This suggests that if
any supersymmetric particle is detected in future experiments, dark matter
candidates will gain a permanent position in these extensions of the Standard
Model.

TL;DR: Neutrino oscillations indicate neutrino mass, requiring Beyond Standard Model physics. Next-gen experiments use high-intensity beams and new detection tech to explore new effects and particles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify physics beyond the Standard Model by studying neutrino oscillations and searching for new particles in neutrino facilities.

Method: Analysis of neutrino oscillation data and utilization of next-generation experiments with high-intensity beams and advanced detection technologies.

Result: Detection of new effects modifying neutrino oscillations or discovery of new particles through these experimental strategies.

Conclusion: Modern and upcoming neutrino experiments are crucial for uncovering BSM physics beyond neutrino mass, offering pathways to explore fundamental particle interactions.

Abstract: Neutrino oscillations are a phenomenon that has been observed for over two
decades and leads to the conclusion that neutrinos have mass. The Standard
Model predicts massless neutrinos, and so neutrinos require physics beyond the
Standard Model. Other signatures of BSM physics are detectable in modern
neutrino facilities -- this chapter explores those possibilities. These can
range from new effects modifying neutrino oscillations (beyond the expectations
when neutrinos have mass), to searches for new particles in neutrino
facilities. Next-generation experiments are particularly powerful for these
searches due to high-intensity neutrino beams and novel detection technologies.
We give an introduction to these search strategies, giving a non-comprehensive
overview of the field as it stands presently.

*Paul Caucal,Edmond Iancu,Farid Salazar,Feng Yuan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper provides the first complete calculation of real next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to dijet production in electron-ion collisions at small x, under the condition where P_perp >> K_perp and Q_s. The findings confirm TMD factorization with the same hard factor as tree-level and a NLO corrected Weizsäcker-Williams gluon TMD involving four Wilson-line operators. The study also recovers known quantum evolutions (B-JIMWLK, CSS, DGLAP) and isolates the gluon splitting function at high transverse momenta.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of complete NLO calculations for dijet production in electron-ion collisions at small x, particularly in the regime dominated by large P_perp relative to K_perp and Q_s. This fills a theoretical gap critical for precise predictions in high-energy scattering experiments and understanding quantum evolution effects.

Method: Performed a first-principles NLO amplitude calculation using TMD factorization framework, focusing on back-to-back dijet events with P_perp >> K_perp and Q_s. Derived explicit expressions for NLO corrections to the WW gluon TMD involving four Wilson-line operators. Analyzed various kinematic limits to connect with established evolution equations (B-JIMWLK, CSS, DGLAP).

Result: Confirmed TMD factorization holds at NLO with structure consistent with leading order. Explicit quantification of NLO corrections to the WW gluon TMD distribution. Successful derivation showing how different kinematic regimes recover all expected quantum evolution processes. Identification of the gluon splitting function via the high-momentum limit.

Conclusion: Establishes a robust theoretical framework for NLO dijet production analysis in small-x electron-ion collisions, providing critical inputs for future high-energy experiments like EIC. Demonstrates the interconnectedness of various quantum evolution equations under different kinematic conditions, validating the universality of the derived corrections.

Abstract: We revisit the calculation of the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to
dijet production in electron-ion collisions at small $x$. We focus on the
back-to-back configuration where the relative transverse momentum $P_\perp$ of
the measured jets is much larger than both their momentum imbalance $K_\perp$
and the target saturation momentum $Q_s(x,A)$. In this regime, we present for
the first time a complete calculation of the real NLO corrections at leading
power in $1/P_\perp$. Our result exhibits TMD factorisation, with the same hard
factor as at tree-level and a NLO correction to the Weisz\"acker-Williams (WW)
gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution which involves four
Wilson-line operators. By studying different kinematical regimes for $K_\perp$
and for the radiated gluon, we recover all the quantum evolutions that were
previously identified for this process at NLO: the B-JIMWLK high-energy
evolution and the CSS evolution of the gluon WW TMD, and the DGLAP evolution of
the gluon PDF. When both $K_\perp$ and the transverse momentum transferred by
the target are large compared to $Q_s$, all the Wilson-line operators boil down
to the unintegrated gluon distribution and our NLO result for the gluon TMD can
be used to isolate the transverse-momentum dependent gluon splitting function.

Abstract: We examine electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments within a
radiative neutrino mass model featuring TeV-scale scalar leptoquarks
$S(3,1,-1/3)$ and $R(3,2,1/6)$. We utilize textures with decoupling electron
and muon sectors, so that both electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole
moments could receive internal chiral enhancements from different heavy up-type
quarks while in the same time evading the stringent $\mu\to e\gamma$
constraint. A successful fit to neutrino oscillation data requires the
simultaneous presence of one- and two-loop neutrino mass contributions. This
severely constrains the parameter space of the model, which results in a
negligible new physics correction to the muon $g-2$. The electron $g-2$
discrepancy implied by the rubidium experiment, on the other hand, can be
resolved within $2\sigma$ uncertainty provided that neutrino mass ordering is
inverted. Lepton-flavor-violating tau decay rates, such as $\tau\to e\gamma$
and $\tau\to 3e$, are predicted to be within the sensitivities of
next-generation experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose three possible rapidity regulators for higher-order calculations
in low $x$ QCD with gluon saturation, as alternatives to the usual lower
cut-off for the integrals over the light-cone momentum $k^+$. These rapidity
regulators are closely related to the $\eta$ regulator and to the pure rapidity
regulator, which have been used primarily in studies of
transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization within the soft-collinear
effective theory (SCET). By choosing one of the three rapidity regulators that
we propose, formulated in terms of $k^+$, $k^-$ or rapidity respectively, one
can set from the start of the calculation in which of these three variables one
wishes to formulate the low $x$ evolution equations, which is one of the main
advantages of our approach.
  As a test of the viability of these rapidity regulators and of their
practical implementation in higher order calculations with gluon saturation
effects, we use them to revisit the calculation of the NLO corrections to the
dipole factorization of the $F_L$ structure function in inclusive DIS at low
$x$.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents two non-singular models for anisotropic spherical stellar configurations using Einstein's equations. By applying specific boundary conditions and matching with Schwarzschild metric, the models satisfy physical validity criteria and show anisotropy's superiority in compact stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role of anisotropy in compact stellar interiors and validate relativistic models that overcome limitations of perfect fluid assumptions, ensuring physical requirements like regularity and stability.

Method: Develop Einstein field equations for static spherical spacetime, apply two constraints involving radial geometric component and anisotropy. Solve differential equations with integration constants determined via Schwarzschild exterior metric matching at the interface. Use observational data of six stars to graphically assess physical properties.

Result: Both models meet all physical validation criteria. Anisotropy is shown to be critical for accurate description of compact objects, outperforming isotropic perfect fluid models.

Conclusion: The superiority of anisotropic fluid models over isotropic ones in describing compact stellar interiors is confirmed, highlighting the importance of anisotropy in relativistic astrophysics.

Abstract: Two distinct non-singular interior models that describe anisotropic spherical
configurations are presented in this work. We develop the Einstein field
equations and the associated mass function in accordance with a static
spherical spacetime. We then discuss certain requirements that must be
satisfied for compact models to be physically validated. Two distinct
limitations are taken into account to solve the field equations, including
different forms of the radial geometric component and anisotropy, which
ultimately leads to a couple of relativistic models. In both cases, solving the
differential equations result in the appearance of integration constants. By
equating the Schwarzschild exterior metric and spherical interior line element
on the interface, these constants are explicitly obtained. The disappearance of
the radial pressure on the hypersurface is also used in this context. We
further use estimated radii and masses of six different stars to graphically
visualize the physical properties of new solutions. Both of our models are
deduced to be well-aligned with all physical requirements, indicating the
superiority of the presence of anisotropy in compact stellar interiors over the
perfect isotropic fluid content.

Abstract: In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike
singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the
transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric
dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described
by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$
near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples
of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and
apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically
symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike
singularities. Our main results include:
  _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes
solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies
on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged
spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical
black hole.
  _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black
hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field
equations.
  In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior
only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon
$\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity
$\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$.
  Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting
null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance
in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this
phenomenon is conjecturally generic for the Einstein-scalar-field model, even
beyond spherical symmetry.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We perform time-domain evolutions of the ergoregion instability on a
horizonless spinning ultracompact spacetime in scalar theories with
potential-type and derivative self-interactions mimicking the nonlinear
structure of the Einstein equations. We find that the instability saturates by
triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, which transfers energy from the
most unstable and large-scale modes to small scales. The cascade's nonlinear
timescales of each mode are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding
linear e-folding times. Through this mechanism, the counter-rotating stable
light ring is filled with a spectrum of higher-order azimuthal modes forming a
ring-like shape. Thereby we demonstrate that turbulent processes are likely
also important during the fully gravitational saturation of the instability,
leaving imprints in the gravitational wave emission.

### [33] [Ergoregion instability in bosonic stars: scalar mode structure, universality, and weakly nonlinear effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07468)
*Nils Siemonsen*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the ergoregion instability in ultracompact spinning Proca and boson stars by analyzing scalar field instabilities using multiple methods. They identify universal mode features, including zero-mode onset, scaling relations between frequencies and growth rates, and efolding times around 10^4 M. Nonlinear backreaction shows gravitational wave emission and amplified instability, suggesting strong nonlinear effects during saturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the ergoregion instability in compact objects like Proca and boson stars, which are horizonless but rapidly spinning. Prior work has explored similar instabilities in Kerr spacetimes, but this extends analysis to these alternative compact objects, investigating universal behaviors and the role of nonlinear effects.

Method: Combined application of WKB approximation, frequency-domain analysis, time-domain simulations, and nonlinear backreaction modeling. Methods were used to study mode structures, growth rates, and gravitational wave emissions from unstable scalar fields in these spacetimes.

Result: Key results include universal mode characteristics (zero-mode signaling instability onset, frequency-growth scaling, eikonal limit behavior matching counter-rotating null geodesics), limited number of unstable overtone/polar modes, short e-folding times (~1e4 M). Nonlinear backreaction demonstrated growth rate shifts and increased gravitational wave emission, pointing towards amplified instability.

Conclusion: Ergoregion instability in horizonless spacetimes like Proca/boson stars follows similar universal patterns as Kerr-like objects. Nonlinear gravitational effects likely play critical roles in saturation phases. Study underscores importance of considering both universal linear properties and nonlinear dynamics in astrophysical compact object stability.

Abstract: Ultracompact spinning horizonless spacetimes with ergoregions are subject to
the ergoregion instability. We systematically investigate the instability of a
massless scalar field in a variety of rapidly spinning Proca stars and boson
stars using WKB-, frequency-, and time-domain methods. We find universal
features in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a
zero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple
scaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects),
the mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably
trapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal
mode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially
growing. The e-folding times are as short as $\tau\sim 10^4 M$ (in terms of the
spacetime's ADM mass $M$). Interestingly, we find a near universal relationship
between the frequencies and growth rates across all bosonic stars and also
compared with Kerr-like objects. Furthermore, we show that weakly nonlinear
backreaction of the instability induces a shift in growth rates as well as
emission of gravitational waves; we find evidence that these effects lead to an
amplification of the unstable process. This suggests that strongly nonlinear
interactions are important during the gravitational saturation of the
instability.

Abstract: We investigate a rotating black hole embedded in a five-dimensional flat bulk
by extending the Kerr metric through the Gurses-Gursey line element. Employing
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we reinterpret the black hole as a charged-like
object in five dimensions and analyze its horizon structure and shadow
morphology. Our results reveal that the shadow is shaped by an axially
symmetric gravitational field modulated by an extrinsic curvature term arising
from the higher-dimensional embedding. Simulations demonstrate that the
visibility amplitude and shadow profile of the Gurses-Gursey black hole align
with Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87 in the Kerr limit, while also
allowing measurable deviations that could be probed by future high-resolution
experiments.

It establishes a framework consistent with thermodynamic laws and holographic principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified framework for Bekenstein entropy extensions and ensure consistency with thermodynamic laws and the holographic principle, addressing limitations in previous entropy formulations.

Method: Applying the Clausius relation with Hawking temperature to derive the generalized mass-horizon relation, then extending this to entropy forms that incorporate statistical mechanics, quantum gravity, and phenomenological considerations.

Result: A generalized entropy framework was successfully formulated, demonstrating consistency with thermodynamic laws and the holographic principle across cosmological horizons.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust foundation for studying thermodynamics of cosmological horizons, offering a versatile tool for future research in quantum gravity and holography.

Abstract: We introduce a generalized mass-horizon relation applicable to cosmological
horizons. This formulation provides a unified framework for deriving a broad
class of Bekenstein entropy extensions motivated by statistical mechanics,
quantum gravity, and phenomenological considerations, through the application
of the Clausius relation together with the Hawking temperature. We further
introduce this notion as a foundational framework for constructing generalized

Motivation: Extend previous work on Kerr black hole perturbations to non-asymptotically flat spacetimes with (anti-)de Sitter boundaries, enabling applications in numerical studies of the holographic correspondence.

Method: Explicitly derives metric components (in ingoing/outgoing radiation gauges) from Weyl scalar modes using Hertz potentials, provides formulas in terms of separated radial/angular modes.

Result: Derives explicit expressions for perturbation metrics and Hertz potential-based formulas, offering tools for numerical analysis in holographic contexts.

Conclusion: These results will enhance numerical approaches to black hole perturbation theory, particularly in exploring gravitational dynamics via holographic methods.

Abstract: In this second paper of our series started with \cite{Berens2024}, we
investigate linearized gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black
hole in a non-asymptotically flat spacetime with (anti-)de Sitter boundary
conditions. Here, we explicitly write down the metric components (in both
ingoing and outgoing radiation gauge) of the perturbations that correspond to a
given mode of either Weyl scalar. We provide formulas involving Hertz
potentials (intermediate quantities with a holographic interpretation) as well
as some that involve only the separated radial and angular modes. We expect
these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies of black hole
perturbation theory in the context of the holographic correspondence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the metric signature can emerge dynamically and determine the conditions under which a stable Lorentzian phase, essential for causality, arises.

Method: A curvature-minimizing potential is constructed, whose degenerate minima correspond to different geometric phases. The stability and dynamics of these phases are analyzed under the model's framework.

Result: The model shows that Lorentzian signature is the only stable configuration allowing causal structure, while Euclidean and mixed phases are unstable.

Conclusion: The dynamical emergence of Lorentzian geometry is justified as necessary for causal physics, suggesting metric signature is not a priori fixed but an outcome of dynamical processes.

Abstract: A simple covariant model is presented where the signature of the metric is a
dynamical field. Degenerate minima of a curvature-minimizing potential
correspond to Euclidean, Lorentzian or mixed phases of geometry. The Lorentzian
phase emerges as the only stable configuration supporting causal propagation.

Abstract: In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean
anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been
thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it
exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous
investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities
peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin
$\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the
initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer
orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to
explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through
gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that
while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum
$L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy
$E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory
patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$.
By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral
to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across
all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of
$E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR),
post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the
inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the
observed oscillations. ...

Abstract: In this paper, we study the kinematic effects of spinning test particles
orbiting the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole. Employing with the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, we explore the dynamics of precessing
orbits and distinct orbital types, including circular orbits and innermost
stable circular orbits. Our results reveal the substantial impact of the
magnetic field on the trajectories of spinning particles, particularly in
regions characterized by significant radial distances. More importantly, our
study shows that an augmented magnetic field necessitates an increased orbital
angular momentum to uphold spinning particles within their characteristic
orbits at equivalent radial distances. Our result contributes valuable insights
to the understanding of the spinning celestial object motion around black holes
endowed with magnetic fields.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from
Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a
Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are
usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole
solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are
astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the
present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of
astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of
particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in
the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black
holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the
particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a
thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation
limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on
(near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Th spontaneous scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black
hole is performed in the EEH-scalar theory by introducing an exponential scalar
coupling (with $\alpha$ coupling constant) to the Maxwell term.Here, the EEH
black hole as a blad black hole is described by mass $M$ and magnetic charge
$q$ with an action parameter $\mu$. A choice of $\mu=0.3$ gurantees a single
horizon with unrestricted magnetic charge $q$. The onset scalarization of this
black hole appears for a positive coupling $\alpha$ with an unlimited magnetic
charge $q$. However, there exists a difference between $q\le1$ and $q>1$ onset
scalarizations. We notify the presence of infinite branches labeled by the
number of $n=0,1,2,\cdots$ of scalarized charged black holes by taking into
account the scalar seeds around the EEH black hole. We find that the $n=0$
fundamental branch of all scalarized black holes is stable against the radial
perturbations, while the $n=1$ excited branch is unstable.

*Mu-Chun Chen,Yan Cao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how dark scalar or vector fields sourced by eccentric supermassive black hole binaries can accelerate mergers via dipole radiation, extending the mass range for merges within a Hubble time. It also shows this affects the low-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background, analyzed using pulsar timing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the final-parsec problem by exploring mechanisms that accelerate binary mergers and to understand impacts on gravitational-wave backgrounds detectable by pulsar timing arrays.

Method: Derived radiation fluxes from eccentric charged Keplerian binaries using flat spacetime results, constructed a model for the gravitational-wave spectrum, and performed Bayesian analysis with pulsar timing data.

Result: Dipole radiation alone does not fully resolve the final-parsec problem but modifies the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic background. Bayesian analysis with current data supports these spectral changes.

Conclusion: Dark fields' dipole radiation contributes to merging binaries within cosmic times and alters gravitational-wave signals, offering new observational signatures for pulsar timing arrays to detect.

Abstract: The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding
the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a
scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric
binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation,
and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a
Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary
are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat
spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully
resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the
stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary
inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a
Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores gravitational perturbations on black holes in noncommutative spacetimes with specific commutator relations between coordinates. It develops an analytical effective potential for axial perturbations valid at all noncommutativity parameter orders using Bopp shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how noncommutative geometry affects black hole perturbations, particularly in extreme scenarios like Planck-scale black holes where noncommutativity and horizon scales compete.

Method: Analytically derives the effective potential for axial perturbations using star-products translated via Bopp shifts. Explores noncommutativity regimes characterized by arbitrary functions A(r) encompassing Moyal-type and κ-Minkowski spaces

Result: Obtains a general analytical expression for the effective potential applicable to all orders of noncommutativity parameters, valid across different regimes including Planck-scale black holes.

Conclusion: Noncommutative effects significantly influence black hole dynamics, especially at extreme scales. The derived potential provides a framework for future studies on noncommutative spacetime effects in strong gravity regimes.

Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbation theory of black holes in
noncommutative spacetimes with noncommutativity of the type
$[t\stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \alpha A(r)$ and $[\varphi \stackrel{\star}{,}
r] = i a \beta A(r)$ for arbitrary $A(r)$, which includes several Moyal-type
spaces and also the $\kappa$-Minkowski space. The main result of this paper is
an analytical expression for the effective potential of the axial perturbation
modes, valid to all orders in the noncommutativity parameter. This is achieved
by evaluating the $\star$-products using translations in the radial direction,
i.e., Bopp shift. We comment on various regimes, such as Planck-scale black
holes, where the noncommutativity length scale is of the same order of
magnitude as the black hole horizon.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper conducts a Hamiltonian constraint analysis of R² gravity, confirming its linearized spectrum around traceless-Ricci spacetimes (e.g., Minkowski, Schwarzschild, Kerr) is empty due to constraints becoming first-class. Higher-order perturbations also show no degrees of freedom, indicating these backgrounds are strong-coupling surfaces. Cosmological analysis shows the universe can cross the R=0 surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve controversies about the particle spectrum of R² gravity, clarify the nature of its constraints, and understand dynamics around singular backgrounds.

Method: Full Hamiltonian constraint analysis of R² gravity, linearization around Minkowski and other traceless-Ricci spacetimes, higher-order perturbation theory, cosmological phase-space analysis.

Result: Linearized spectrum around R=0 spacetimes is empty; constraints' class changes (ten second-class → ten first-class, three momentum → one). No degrees of freedom at any perturbation order. Strong-coupling surfaces prevent perturbative dynamics, but cosmological evolution can cross R=0.

Conclusion: R² gravity's dynamics exhibit nonperturbative behavior around certain backgrounds, challenging standard analysis. The evolving universe can traverse R=0 surfaces despite strong coupling, offering insights into gravitational theory and cosmological behavior.

Abstract: We perform a full Hamiltonian constraint analysis of pure
Ricci-scalar-squared ($R^2$) gravity to clarify recent controversies regarding
its particle spectrum. While it is well established that the full theory
consistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its
linearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that
this is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of
all traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the
Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon
is a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten
second-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three
momentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint. Furthermore, we show
that higher order perturbation theory around these singular backgrounds reveals
no degrees of freedom at any order. This is in conflict with the general
analysis and points to the fact that such backgrounds are surfaces of strong
coupling in field space, where the dynamics of perturbations becomes
nonperturbative. We further show via a cosmological phase-space analysis that
the evolving universe is able to penetrate through the singular $R=0$ surface.

### [45] [Scalar-tensor theories in the Lyra geometry: Invariance under local transformations of length units and the Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08433)
*E. C. Valadão,Felipe Sobrero,Santiago Esteban Perez Bergliaffa*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the Lyra geometry's potential to unify scalar-tensor theories by introducing a scale function that acts as a conformal factor, enabling transformations between different frames. It shows that Brans-Dicke and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories emerge as special cases under Lyra transformations, aligning with the Mach-Dicke principle. The study resolves the Jordan-Einstein frame ambiguity by framing them as representations of a single theory in Lyra manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate Lyra geometry's capacity to generalize scalar-tensor theories (Brans-Dicke, Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet) through a scale function source term, unifying their formulations and addressing the frame dependency conundrum. The goal is to geometrically interpret scalar fields as fundamental length-unit transformations under the Mach-Dicke principle.

Method: The paper constructs Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST) by encoding the scale function as the conformal factor governing local length units. It applies Lyra transformations to switch between frames, demonstrating how known scalar-tensor theories emerge in specific frames. A key step is analyzing frame transformations to unify different theories under Lyra geometry.

Result: By applying Lyra transformations, the paper derives General Relativity from LyST in a globally fixed frame, Brans-Dicke gravity, and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories in local frames. The Jordan-Einstein frame dilemma is resolved by showing they represent the same physics under Lyra geometry. Conservation laws in the Einstein frame are naturally preserved.

Conclusion: The Lyra formalism provides a coherent geometric framework for scalar-tensor theories, eliminating frame ambiguities by attributing frame differences to local length-unit variations. This approach emphasizes the role of the scale function as a geometric scalar field, consistent with Mach-Dicke principles, and establishes Lyra geometry as a foundational tool for unifying scalar-gravity models.

Abstract: The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely
geometrical scalar-tensor theories due to the natural presence of the Lyra
scale function. This paper explores further the scale function source term to
construct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of
both Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It
is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry
comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of
length units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally
fixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in
which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity
is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same
procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke
gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from
their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the
Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is
controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known
scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular
Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls
the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from
the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry
makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the
same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally.
The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring
scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of
the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein
frame.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the formation and evolution of supermassive black hole binaries, their observable signatures, and the impact of their interactions with galactic environments on gravitational wave predictions.

Method: Review of existing observational evidence for dual active galactic nuclei at various scales, analysis of gas and star interactions influencing binary hardening, and examination of potential gravitational wave detection technologies.

Result: Observational signatures of binaries from kpc to parsec scales are identified, with possible closer binaries detected in jetted systems. Interactions with host galaxies introduce uncertainties in gravitational wave models. Pulsar timing arrays may already hint at a background signal, while LISA promises direct merger observations.

Conclusion: Future missions like LISA and advancements in pulsar timing arrays are critical for confirming binary existence and refining gravitational wave predictions, despite current observational and theoretical challenges.

Abstract: We review the state of the evidence for the existence and observational
appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from
standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each
containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger
remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in
the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively
accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples
of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales.
Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in
jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy
significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to
uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers.
Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to
detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries. The
first signs of the combined background of inspiralling objects might have been
seen already.

Abstract: X-ray binary accretion disk winds can carry away a significant fraction of
the originally infalling matter and hence strongly affect the accretion flow
and the long-term evolution of the binary system. However, accurate
measurements of their mass outflow rates are challenging due to uncertainties
in our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption
line spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind
streamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid
this issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range
of sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present
the first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new
XRISM observatory and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a
time-resolved analysis and constrain the properties of the wind vertical
structure. Thanks to the precision spectroscopy of XRISM/Resolve, we directly
detect the Her X-1 orbital motion in the evolution of the outflow velocity.
After correcting for this effect, we observe an increase in velocity from 250
km/s to 600 km/s as the wind rises to greater heights above the disk. The wind
column density decreases with height, as expected, but its ionization parameter
only evolves weakly, and is consistent with freezing out as the wind expands
away. Additionally, we detect a new orbital dependence of the wind properties,
revealing a likely second wind component that appears only briefly after the
eclipse of Her X-1 by the secondary star.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of PSR J1023+0038 reveals an anti-correlation between X-ray flux and optical modulation amplitude, suggesting X-rays may not be the sole irradiation source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the irradiation mechanism in redback pulsar binaries by analyzing optical-X-ray correlations, leveraging XMM-Newton's superior X-ray sensitivity over gamma-ray observations.

Method: Analyzed 18 simultaneous XMM-Newton X-ray and B-band optical observations (717 ks total exposure) during the LMXB state. Tested for anti-correlation between X-ray flux and optical modulation amplitude. Extended analysis to Fermi-LAT GeV data and explored low-mode correlations.

Result: Observed anti-correlation between higher X-ray flux and lower optical modulation (1.7-3.1σ significance). No significant GeV gamma-ray correlations. Some observations showed X-ray/optical low-mode correlations with unclear origins.

Conclusion: X-ray irradiation's effect is stronger in fainter X-ray states, implying another dominant heating source exists besides X-rays. This challenges the assumption that X-rays are the primary optical modulation driver.

Abstract: X-ray emission is generally believed to be one of the major heating sources
for the optical modulation in redback pulsar binaries as we have seen similar
phenomena in many low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). While, e.g., MeV/GeV
gamma-rays from the neutron stars are also possible heating sources, X-ray
observations are currently much more sensitive, and therefore, joint
optical--X-ray data are observationally unique on the irradiation mechanism
investigation. Using 18 X-ray/B-band simultaneous XMM-Newton observations (717
ks in total) of the redback system PSR J1023+0038 taken during the LMXB state,
we find a general trend that the amplitude of the B-band orbital modulation was
lower when the observed X-ray flux was higher. Depending on the analysis method
adopted, the statistical significance of the anti-correlation can be from
1.7sigma to 3.1sigma. We also extended the analysis to the GeV gamma-ray band
using the Fermi-LAT data, but the result is insignificant to claim any
relations. Moreover, another X-ray/optical correlation regarding the low modes
of the system was found in some of the \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, and
the astrophysical reason behind is currently unclear yet. These
anti-correlations likely suggest that the irradiation is generally stronger
when the X-ray flux is in a fainter state, indicating that there is a more
dominant irradiation source than the X-ray emission.

*Tianzhe Zhou,Chun Huang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU-accelerated framework for pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of X-ray emission from millisecond pulsars, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency. This addresses previous limitations in balancing resolution and speed, allowing more precise constraints on pulsar properties and improving equation of state determinations for dense matter. Additionally, it corrects biases in atmosphere lookup table interpolations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the accuracy-speed trade-off in Bayesian PPM, which previously required low resolution (causing biases) or high-resolution computations (too slow for practical inference). This limits the reliability and feasibility of deriving accurate pulsar parameters and equation of state constraints.

Method: Developed a GPU-accelerated PPM framework achieving ~1e-3 accuracy, reducing computation time from minutes to milliseconds on an RTX 4080. Implemented a mixed-order interpolator to correct biases near boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, validated with two diagnostic tests.

Result: The framework enables high-fidelity PPM at speeds enabling practical Bayesian inference. Demonstrates removal of biases in hotspot geometry and atmosphere interpolation, broadening the feasible model space and reducing systematic errors in pulsar parameter estimation.

Conclusion: The advancements improve the reliability and scope of PPM analyses, supporting more accurate inferences for current/future X-ray missions. This enhances understanding of dense matter equations of state and pulsar properties through better-resolved, faster computational methods.

Abstract: Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered
millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius
$R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian
PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions
used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries
and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove
this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference
impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public
GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to
within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while
collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX
4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at
resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias
near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it
with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator.
Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce
key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray
missions.

Abstract: The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a natural environment
where stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can dynamically pair, undergo repeated
interactions, and eventually merge. It is commonly assumed that gas accretion
will both efficiently spin up disk-embedded black holes and align the orbits of
embedded binaries with the disk plane, leading to mergers with preferentially
positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Such predictions
have motivated the use of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a diagnostic for identifying
candidate AGN-embedded mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave
catalog. In this work, we perform post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations of nearly
planar binary-single encounters and apply an empirically motivated, gas-driven
alignment prescription to characterize the expected
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$-eccentricity correlations of AGN-embedded mergers. By
comparing the alignment and gravitational-wave inspiral timescales, we identify
the regions of parameter space, across both disk location and binary
properties, where full disk-spin-orbit alignment is effective and where it is
not. We find that quasi-circular binaries typically align by the time they
merge, supporting the standard picture of spin-orbit aligned orientations. By
contrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity
$e_{10\mathrm{Hz}}\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques
to act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding
more isotropic $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and
torque efficiencies are modest. This interplay naturally establishes a
correlation between binary eccentricity and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in AGN disks,
highlighting a new key observable of the AGN channel and a potential
explanation for massive events such as GW190521 and GW231123.

*Lin Yu,Tianxing Hu,Zhiyu Lei,Dong Wu,Suming Weng,Min Chen,Jie Zhang,Zhengming Sheng*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential correlation between fast radio bursts (FRBs) and cosmic rays (CRs), proposing that FRBs could contribute to CRs through localized particle acceleration mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether FRBs, with their extreme field strengths, can accelerate particles to ultra-high energies, potentially linking them to cosmic rays.

Method: The study examines particle acceleration driven by FRB-like electromagnetic pulses, identifying two regimes (wakefield and piston) based on field strength and plasma density. Predictions are validated against particle-in-cell simulations.

Result: Ultra-high energy neutral plasma sheets form via FRB pulse erosion. Two acceleration regimes are confirmed, with energy scalings matching simulations. A power-law spectrum resembling CRs is produced as FRBs diffuse.

Conclusion: FRBs may play a role in cosmic ray acceleration, offering a new avenue for multi-messenger astronomy through joint observations of FRBs and CRs.

Abstract: Two extreme events in the universe, fast radio bursts (FRBs) and cosmic rays
(CRs), could be corelated, where FRBs with extreme field strength near their
sources may contribute to CRs. This study investigates localized particle
acceleration driven by FRB-like ultra-relativistic electromagnetic pulses. It
is found ultra-high energy neutral plasma sheets form constantly via the front
erosion of an FRB pulse. There are two ion acceleration regimes depending upon
the field strength and the plasma density: the wakefield regime dominated by
charge separation fields, and the piston regime driven by the
$\mathbf{V}\times\mathbf{B}$ force of the pulses. The predicted energy scalings
align well with particle-in-cell simulations. A power-law energy spectrum
naturally arises with an index close to the CRs during FRB diffusion outward.
Joint observations of FRBs and CRs may provide an opportunity to understand
these extreme events and advance the development of multi-messenger astronomy.

Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors are observing an increasing number of binary
black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing a bimodal mass distribution of BBHs, which
hints at diverse formation histories for these systems. Using the rapid binary
population synthesis code MOBSE, we simulate a series of population synthesis
models that include chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By considering
metallicity-specific star formation and selection effects, we compare the
intrinsic merger rates and detection rates of each model with observations. We
find that the observed peaks in the mass distribution of merging BBHs at the
low-mass end (10\msun) and the high-mass end (35\msun) are contributed by the
common envelope channel or stable mass transfer channel (depending on the
stability criteria for mass transfer) and the CHE channel, respectively, in our
model. The merger rates and detection rates predicted by our model exhibit
significant sensitivity to the choice of physical parameters. Different models
predict merger rates ranging from 15.4 to $96.7\,\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ at
redshift $z$ = 0.2, and detection rates ranging from 22.2 to
148.3$\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ under the assumption of a detectable redshift range of
$z \le$ 1.0.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: MAGIC telescopes detected two GRBs (190114C and 201216C) at VHE energies, revealing a new sub-TeV emission component and expanding our understanding of GRB afterglow models. The results challenge current detection limits and raise questions about VHE emission in various GRB classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the sensitivity of MAGIC telescopes and explore VHE GRB emissions, particularly in understanding broadband emission models and the role of redshift in observed fluxes.

Method: Utilized MAGIC's improved sensitivity and automated follow-up to detect GRBs. Analyzed multi-wavelength data (17 orders of magnitude in energy) using a one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton model with internal γ-γ absorption.

Result: Detected VHE emissions in GRB 190114C and GRB 201216C. The former showed a new sub-TeV component; the latter was the most distant VHE source due to high redshift (z=1.1). No VHE emission was found in other observed GRBs (2013-2019) with z<2 and X-ray data.

Conclusion: These detections open new questions about sub-TeV emission in GRBs. Future observations aim to address detection challenges posed by redshift and expand understanding of GRB physics.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the main targets for the observations of
the MAGIC telescopes. As a result of the effort in improving the sensitivity of
the instrument and the automatic follow-up strategy, MAGIC detected two GRBs in
the very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) range, namely GRB 190114C and GRB
201216C. In GRB 190114C ($z=0.42$), the data collected by MAGIC revealed a new
emission component at sub-TeV energies in the afterglow of the GRB. The very
rich multi-wavelength dataset, spanning 17 orders of magnitude in energy,
allowed to perform a detailed modelling of the broadband emission. The
multi-wavelength data could be modelled within a one-zone synchrotron-self
Compton scenario with internal $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption, where the model
parameters are compatible with those found in previous GRB afterglow studies
below GeV energies. Similarly, GRB 201216C broadband emission could be
explained using the same model, although the amount of simultaneous
multi-wavelength data is reduced with respect to GRB 190114C. In particular,
GRB 201216C challenged the current MAGIC detection potential, as its redshift
was determined to be $z=1.1$, strongly reducing the observed gamma-ray flux but
making it the most distant source detected at VHE. These two detections,
accompanied by evidence of VHE emission from a few more GRBs, opened up new
questions such as the presence of sub-TeV emission in different classes and
phases of GRBs. In this contribution we will present the status of the MAGIC
GRB follow-up program, with an highlight on its detected GRBs. Moreover we will
show the results on the GRBs observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019 with no
evidence of VHE emission, in particular for those with simultaneous X-ray
observations and redshift $z<2$. We will discuss the implications of these
results for GRB physics and the challenges and prospects for future GRB
observations with MAGIC.

### [54] [A broadband study of FRB20240114A with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08367)
*P. Limaye,L. G. Spitler,N. Manaswini,J. Benáček,F. Eppel,M. Kadler,L. Nicotera,J. Wongphechauxsorn*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses the Effelsberg 100-m telescope to analyze FRB 20240110A, detecting over 700 bursts showing diverse morphologies, constant fractional bandwidths, and burst variability likely due to scintillation. Waiting-time distributions suggest mostly independent bursts with some clustering, and the findings improve understanding of repeating FRB emission mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the temporal and spectral properties of the repeating FRB source FRB 20240110A, newly discovered by CHIME/FRB, in order to understand the variability and emission mechanisms of such bursts.

Method: Effelsberg 100-m telescope observations (1.3-6.0 GHz UBB receiver) across four epochs, analyzing 700+ bursts for temporal/spectral traits like morphology, frequency drifts, burst widths, and waiting-time distributions.

Result: Four burst morphologies identified; emission is band-limited, burst widths narrow with frequency but fractional bandwidths remain constant. Scintillation may drive burst rate variability. Waiting times suggest random bursts with rare clustering (~10 ms timescale). Frequency drift analysis provides new insights.

Conclusion: Broadband observations reveal frequency-dependent burst behavior in FRB 20240110A, supporting scintillation effects and informing models of repeating FRB emission processes.

Abstract: We present Effelsberg 100-m telescope observations of the hyperactive
repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20240110A, discovered by CHIME/FRB in
January 2024. Using the Ultra BroadBand (UBB) receiver, spanning 1.3-6.0 GHz,
we detected over 700 unique bursts across four observing epochs. A
comprehensive analysis of their temporal and spectral properties reveals four
distinct spectro-temporal morphologies, including simple, complex and
frequency-drifting structures. No bursts were detected across the full UBB
band, confirming the band-limited emission typical of repeating FRBs. We find
modest frequency evolution in burst widths but constant fractional bandwidths,
and strong variability in burst rates that may be influenced by scintillation.
The waiting-time distributions indicate predominantly independent burst events,
with occasional clustering suggesting a characteristic emission timescale of
$\sim$10 ms. Additionally, this study presents a multi-frequency analysis of
waiting-time distributions, offering new insights into the complex frequency
drifts commonly observed in repeating FRBs. These broadband observations
provide a detailed view of the frequency-dependent burst behavior of FRB
20240110A and offer insights into the variability and temporal structure of
repeating FRB emission.

Abstract: The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype
of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations. Despite a
rich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and
origin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the
explosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely
from an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with
the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the
optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV
data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk
models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low
mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides
evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal
decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by
interacting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission
and interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even
later times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta
and circumstellar material.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The radioactive decay of unstable nuclei created in the rapid neutron capture
process release a large amount of $\gamma$-rays. When the ejecta is optically
thick, these $\gamma$-rays may contribute to an associated kilonova. Once
transparent, prominent spectral features will be directly observable in current
and future $\gamma$-ray detectors. In this work, we study and compare the
$\gamma$-ray spectra of a limited, weak, strong, and extended $r$-process
across a broad timescale, identifying the nuclei which significantly
contribute. We discuss these findings in the context of observability, noting
that there are several practical challenges to connecting observed signatures
to specific nuclei. However, if these challenges can be overcome, direct
observation of $\gamma$-rays from $r$-process sites can provide insight into
the fundamental physics underpinning the $r$-process.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected:
>10 TeV with LHAASO and >100 TeV with Carpet-3. Such energetic photons are
expected to be absorbed via electron-positron pair production on their way to
the Earth. Their observation might be explained by new physics, including
Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon mixing with axion-like particles
(ALPs). Here, we construct a joint fluence spectrum by combining flux
measurements from both experiments, and fit it under these hypotheses. LIV can
account for the Carpet-3 observation, providing a modest improvement over
standard physics in the overall fit. ALP mixing improves the description of
both LHAASO and Carpet-3 data, yielding a substantial enhancement in fit
quality for a specific region of the ALP parameter space.
