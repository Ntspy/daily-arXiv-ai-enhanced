The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections.

The model indicates correlations between spectral evolution, FRED-pulse narrowing at high energies, and the mass-supply-controlled envelope.

The $\u03b3$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (``double-burst'') structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $\u03b3$-rays at $\\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $\u03b3$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models.

We argue that such an analysis may have oversimplified the real physical scenario. To be more precise, a metric perturbation planted farther away from the black hole horizon might not always be appropriately approximated by a disjoint minor barrier.

Following this line of thought, this study conducts a refined analysis of the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential by closely examining a few physically relevant ingredients. While our analysis qualitatively confirms the main findings of previous studies, as the stability of the fundamental mode is primarily determined by the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency, we show that specific features of both the effective potential at spatial infinity and the metric perturbation can have a sizable impact on the instability.

This analysis utilizes the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray Observatory to indirectly search for dark matter (DM) by studying gamma ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Selected for their high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter, dSphs are useful for this type of search owing to the low background emission. In comparison to previous HAWC studies, we significantly improve our sensitivity to DM from dSphs due to improvements to our event reconstruction and reduced hadronic contamination. We expanded the number of dSphs studied, DM annihilation channels into the Standard Model (SM), and the amount of data collected on each previously studied dSph. We searched for DM signals in each dSph using the latest version of the algorithms used to reconstruct data from the primary detector of the HAWC instrument. We report that we do not detect evidence of DM from dSphs, so we place upper limits for the velocity-weighted DM annihilation cross-section ($\\langle\u03c3v \\rangle$) on the order of $10^{-23}~\\text{cm}^3\\text{s}^{-1}$ for a DM mass range of $1-10^4$ TeV.", "AI": {"tldr": "The HAWC Observatory did not find gamma ray signals from dark matter annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, setting upper limits on the annihilation cross-section for DM masses between 1-10\u2074 TeV.", "motivation": "To advance particle physics and test dark matter models by improving sensitivity in indirect dark matter detection using dSphs' high DM-to-baryonic matter ratio and low background emission.", "method": "Expanded analysis of 26 dSph galaxies with improved HAWC event reconstruction algorithms, covering more annihilation channels and data, reducing hadronic contamination.", "result": "No detected dark matter signal; upper limits set at ~10\u207b\u00b2\u00b3 cm\u00b3/s for \u27e8\u03c3v\u27e9 across 1-10\u2074 TeV DM masses.", "conclusion": "Results constrain DM annihilation models, particularly for high-mass particles, and demonstrate enhanced HAWC sensitivity for future studies."}}

We noted that asymmetric CCFs with lags of a few hundred secondsbetween soft and hard band LCs in the horizontal branch, whereas CCFs remained symmetric in normal and flaring branches. We also performed a CCF study during the flux transition duration and observed lags of the order of a few tens to hundreds of seconds. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the robustness of these CCFs, confirming their significance at a 95% confidence level. Spectral analysis during the flux transitions further suggests that the inner accretion disk extends close to the last stable orbit. We propose that the observed hard lags arise from the readjustment of the boundary layer/coronal region located near the inner edge of the accretion disk.

Determining how much deformation remains at present is crucial for gravitational-wave astronomy. This study is the first investigation into the evolution of quadrupole deformation during the solid crust formation phase to obtain a plausible value at present. The equilibrium structure before solidification is modeled using a fluid description, and the deformation is introduced through an assumed driving force. As the star cools, this force weakens, leading to a gradual decay of the deformation. Eventually, the deformation vanishes in the fluid region but partially remains in the crust, sustained by elastic forces, after solidification. By comparing the equilibrium models before and after solidification, we estimate the residual ellipticity and demonstrate that the spatial profile of the elastic shear is imprinted in the crust. The relic ellipticity is only a few percent of the original value, with its absolute magnitude depending on the deformation mechanism during the hot era, which cannot be specified owing to the lack of elaborate models. This work provides a first step toward linking early neutron star deformation with future gravitational-wave observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the decay of a neutron star's quadruple deformation over time, finding that residual ellipticity after solidification is only a few percent of the original value, influenced by early deformation mechanisms.", "motivation": "To determine the current level of deformation in neutron stars for gravitational-wave astronomy, as earlier deformations decay over time and their residual effects are crucial for observations.", "method": "Modeling the neutron star's evolution using fluid dynamics before solidification and elastic forces afterward, comparing preand post-solidification structures to estimate residual ellipticity.", "result": "Residual ellipticity is found to be a few percent of the original deformation, with its magnitude dependent on unknown early deformation mechanisms.", "conclusion": "Establishes a framework linking early neutron star deformation to gravitational-wave observations, highlighting the need for better models of hot-era deformation mechanisms."}}
