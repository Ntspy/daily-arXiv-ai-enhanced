Comments welcome", "summary": "Many asymmetric dark matter scenarios have been proposed to date. Among them, perhaps the most motivated ones are those in which the dark matter asymmetry is induced from the baryon/lepton asymmetries via chemical equilibration without any new sources of CP violation. However, most of the models put forward along these lines have been excluded by now and/or are based on complicated setups. In this letter, we present a new, simple, and viable scenario. It assumes only two new fields: a scalar singlet and an inert scalar doublet, and is based only on renormalizable interactions, that slowly generate the dark matter asymmetry from the Standard Model Higgs asymmetry. The model allows for the direct detection of dark matter in the upcoming generation of experiments, and the inert doublet is predicted to be light enough to be potentially produced and observed at the LHC and future colliders, $m_{H'}<580\\,{\\rm GeV}$."}

However, accurately grouping and linking a researcher's entire body of work with their individual identity is challenging because of widespread name ambiguity across the growing literature. Algorithmic author name disambiguation provides a scalable approach to disambiguating author identities, yet existing methods have limitations. Many modern author name disambiguation methods rely on comprehensive metadata features such as venue or affiliation. Despite advancements in digitally indexing publications, metadata is often unavailable or inconsistent in large digital libraries(e.g. NASA/ADS). We introduce the Neural Author Name Disambiguator, a method that disambiguates author identities in large digital libraries despite limited metadata availability. We formulate the disambiguation task as a similarity learning problem by employing a Siamese neural network to disambiguate author names across publications relying solely on widely available publication metadata-author names, titles and abstracts. We construct the Large-Scale Physics ORCiD Linked dataset to evaluate the Neural Author Name Disambiguator by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications ORCiD. By leveraging foundation models to embed metadata into features, our model achieves up to 94% accuracy in pairwise disambiguation and over 95% F1 in clustering publications into their researcher identities. We release the testing dataset as a benchmark for physics and astronomy, providing realistic evaluation conditions for future disambiguation methods. The Neural Author Name Disambiguator algorithm demonstrates effective disambiguation with minimal metadata, offering a scalable solution for name ambiguity in large digital libraries."}

The polarization levels seen throughout our observations are on average 0.87% +/- 0.05% higher than those of any Type Ib SN~yet studied, suggesting either that it is the most asymmetric of the sample, or if all SNe Ib have similar asymmetry, that it is viewed at a more optimum angle. Significant continuum polarization indicates that the photosphere exhibited a global departure from spherical symmetry at the level of 10%-40% at the earliest times (days 0--40), which decreased to 0%-20% by days 57--90. During the early photospheric phase, the ejecta maintained a near-constant orientation of 12°-20° on the sky, as shown by the dominant axis in the Stokes q-u plane. Polarization signatures in the Fe II λλλ4924, 5018, 5169 lines shared this axis. Meanwhile, high levels of polarization associated with the He I lines traced distinct q-u loops with a dramatic rotation away from the dominant axis, indicating that the early-time ejecta were also characterized by hot, fast, helium-rich material concentrated near the poles. At day 295, during the transition to the nebular phase, a new, highly elongated structure became prominent in the ejecta, with an axis orthogonal to the dominant axis that defined the photospheric phase. This dual-axis geometry may link SN 2012au's high luminosity and asymmetric structure to a magnetar powering mechanism."}

For PRIMA's Far-InfraRed Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) instrument, we have developed monolithic kilopixel silicon lenslet arrays to efficiently couple incident radiation from the telescope's fore-optics onto the KID absorber elements. These three-dimensional lenslet arrays are fabricated using grayscale lithography, followed by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), and are anti-reflection (AR) coated with a quarter-wavelength thick deposition of Parylene-C. The lenslet arrays are aligned and bonded to the KID arrays using a thin layer of epoxy through a flip-chip bonder. In this work, we report on the optimized fabrication, lens design, AR coating, and bonding processes developed for the FIRESS lenslet arrays. We characterize brassboard lenslet arrays fabricated to meet the specifications of the FIRESS low and high spectral bands, demonstrate stepped-thickness AR-coatings to achieve high efficiency across broad wavelength ranges, and present spectral transmission measurements of the AR coating and the epoxy bonding layers."}

Hendriks"], "title": "Widening of Binaries via Non-conservative Mass Transfer as a Formation Channel for Gaia Black Hole System", "comment": "12 pages, comments are very welcome", "summary": "The detected Gaia systems hosting compact objects challenge standard models of binary star evolution. In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, it is expected that they underwent a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal mass ratios, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to either a stellar merger or a final binary with a very short orbital period. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. With the aid of detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether fully non-conservative mass transfer, where mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two of the Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from the standard isotropic re-emission model, which assumes mass loss from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss model, without the need for fine-tuning, reproduces the observed orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well across a wide range of initial conditions. This scenario, therefore, offers a plausible formation pathway for these systems. We speculate that orbital widening during mass loss could result from the unequal Roche-lobe sizes of the components and eruptive mass loss driven by the donor's high-opacity subsurface layers. Similar mass loss may also be relevant for all other classes of post-mass-transfer binaries that face analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron star and white dwarf systems, binaries hosting stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries."}

We solve the equations and find that black holes generally attract the wavefunctions, localizing them near the horizon where the electrons are most likely to be trapped. These results imply that not only classical objects but also the quantum material and even the chemical properties of the atoms are affected by strong gravity. We also discuss black hydrogen molecules composed of multi-centered Majumdar-Papapetrou black holes."}

To support the image simulations for the main survey of the CSST mission, we present a mock catalogue of stars and galaxies. For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z~3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement. The catalogue provides a flexible dataset for the development of CSST image processing and can support a wide range of cosmological analyses within the CSST mission."}

Variability at very short timescales can push the boundaries between competing models offering us much needed discriminating power. This is particularly true for polarization variability that allows us to probe particle acceleration and high-energy emission models in blazars. Here we present results from the first pilot study of intra-night optical polarization monitoring conducted using RoboPol at the Skinakas Observatory and supplemented by observations from the Calar Alto, Perkins, and Sierra Nevada observatories. Our results show that while variability patterns can widely vary between sources, variability on timescales as short as minutes is prevalent in blazar jets. The amplitude of variations are typically small, a few percent for the polarization degree and less than 20 degrees for the polarization angle, pointing to a significant contribution to the optical emission from a turbulent magnetic field component, while the overall stability of the polarization angle over time points to a preferred magnetic field orientation."}

Within this framework, we construct an isotropic and homogeneous metric analogous to the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric but without a universal speed limit. Two distinct solutions of the Einstein-like field equations are obtained: (i) a vacuum configuration ($λ=0$) yielding an exponential--quadratic scale factor, and (ii) a dust-dominated universe ($λ=1$) described by a non-interacting nonrelativistic fluid. Upon dimensional reduction to $3+1$ spacetime through a specific embedding, the model naturally develops anisotropy in the scale factor and density, consistent with the near-zero spatial curvature inferred from Planck data. In the case of vanishing spatial curvature, the framework reproduces Milne's Newtonian cosmology because this condition leads to a vanishing pressure. This provides an independent nonrelativistic setting for cosmological dynamics within Galilean covariance."}

Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a ~480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3. This source shows a steep radio spectrum and a high degree of circular polarisation. These results underscore the strong potential of variance imaging for pulsar detection in full EMU and future radio continuum surveys planned with Square Kilometre Array (SKA)."}

Understanding the motion of this gas provides critical insight into processes such as mergers, turbulence, and energy dissipation in the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The Coma cluster is a nearby, massive system long suspected to be dynamically disturbed. Previous high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the XRISM mission revealed bulk motions in the cluster core and southern regions. Here we present new XRISM Resolve observations of a northern region in Coma, which reveal a coherent velocity gradient of nearly $530 km/s across the cluster from south to north. We find that the hot gas in this northern region exhibits modest line-of-sight motions and uniform thermodynamic properties, indicating relatively mild local disturbances. The consistent levels of turbulence throughout the cluster suggest that the energy from a past merger has been distributed on large scales. These findings provide compelling evidence for an off-axis merger event and demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can uncover subtle dynamical signatures in the ICM, offering important constraints for simulations of cluster evolution."}

The Cornell parameters are calibrated directly to the spin-averaged $B_c$ tower by anchoring the $1S$ centroid and scanning a grid in $(σ,κ)$, with the additive constant $V_0$ fixed at each point by the experimental ground state mass. The spectrum is obtained with a two stage Monte Carlo approach. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) provides optimized radial trial states with the desired nodal pattern. Fixed node Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) then projects the corresponding ground state energies for each $(n,\\ell)$ channel. Controlled scans over the GFMC time step, projection time, walker population, and radial grid identify plateau regions where discretization and projection systematics are quantitatively under control. At a representative best point in the low-RMSE valley, the predicted spin-averaged masses agree with the experimental centroids at the level of a few tens of MeV, and the fitted Cornell parameters are consistent with canonical heavy quarkonium analyses."}

We analyze the energy conditions, identifying where the null, weak, dominant and strong conditions hold or fail across the core and exterior. The parameter space for horizon formation is mapped and the thermodynamic propertie -- mass, Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity -- are derived; notably, the entropy depends only on the regularization scale while the string parameter modifies temperature and heat capacity. Employing Rényi non-extensive entropy and the topological thermodynamics approach, we show the non-extensive deformation stabilizes the system and removes the standard phase transition.

Such decays are very important for the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{ub}|$ and testing the nature of the excited light mesons. The mixing schemes for the isoscalar light mesons are considered. The possible assignment of the experimentally observed excited light mesons to the particular states is discussed. The form factors parameterizing weak decay matrix elements between the initial $B$ meson and final light mesons are calculated with the complete account of the relativistic effects, including contributions of the intermediate negative energy states and relativistic transformations of the meson wave functions from rest to the moving reference frame. As a result the transferred momentum squared, $q^2$, dependence of the form factors is explicitly determined in the whole accessible kinematical range. On the basis of the helicity formalism the decay branching fractions and asymmetry and polarization parameters are calculated. The obtained results for the semileptonic $B$ decays to the ground states of light mesons are confronted with available experimental data. On this basis the value of the $|V_{ub}|$ matrix element is determined. It is found in good agreement with the value extracted from inclusive decays. Predictions for the branching fractions of the semileptonic $B$ decays to radially ($2S$ and $3S$) and orbitally ($1P$ and $2P$) excited light mesons are given. Comparison with the previous calculations is performed. It is found that several decays to the excited light mesons have branching fractions of the order $10^{-4}$ and, thus, they can be measured at existing and future $B$ factories."}

For each galaxy in the Catalogue, we use the simulated mass and starformation to constrain the galaxy's star-formation history, and predict its contribution to the gravitational-wave energy density through CBC mergers. Combining such contributions from all galaxies in the Catalogue results in a prediction for the frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy of the CBC SGWB. We also compare this prediction to semi-analytical models of SGWB generated by compact binaries. We identify a set of effective parameters that capture the key features of these models, and we apply a Bayesian framework to infer these parameters assuming an ideal scenario of cosmic variance-limited search. This represents the first step toward developing a comprehensive framework that will eventually enable the correlation of SGWB anisotropy and \\textit{Euclid} galaxy data, potentially allowing us to extract valuable astrophysical information from this new observable."}

We present in this paper an approach to enable the simulation of SSSB conditions in a drop tower facility on Earth, which is being addressed as part of the AKUS (\"Activity of Comets under Partial Gravity\") project. This especially concerns their prevailing gravity levels, which range between 10^-2 g and 10^-4 g. In order to simulate the conditions of SSSB as accurately as possible, an acceleration system based on servo motors and spindle axes has been developed. The accelerations are transferred from the motors to the spindle axes containing a comet-like sample. These are together placed inside a vacuum chamber providing a vacuum quality of 10^-6 mbar. The whole setup is installed inside the Einstein-Elevator. Our results show that, with the current setup, we are able to generate conditions from 10^-2 g down to 10^-3 g. The maximum deviations under these conditions are +/-5x10^-4 g. Additionally, this setup offers the opportunity to conduct different kinds of experiments in which the described gravity levels and vacuum conditions are needed."}

We measure the properties of key emission features, namely those at 6300, 7300, and 7774 angstroms (associated with [O I], [Ca II]/[O II], and O I, respectively), and find that SLSNe exhibit much wider spectral diversity than normal SNe Ic, primarily in the line ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, which is highly sensitive to ejecta ionization. Some events exhibit weak [O I] and a clear [O II] contribution to the 7300 angstrom feature, enhancing the ratio, along with [O III] lines at 4363 and 5007 angstroms. Other SLSNe show weak or no lines of ionized oxygen. Moreover, we find that the population exhibits decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ over time, while a few outliers instead display sustained high or increasing ratios for extended periods. The ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ is also correlated with the rise and decline times of the light curves, with slower events exhibiting higher ionization, the first robust connection between early light curve and late-time spectral properties, likely due to the magnetar's impact: slower-evolving SLSNe are generally powered by engines with longer spin-down timescales, which deposit more energy at later phases. Among the events with decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, SLSNe with high ionization are on average powered by magnetars with higher thermalized spin-down power, a correlation that is most significant for events with $M_{\\rm ej}\\lesssim12$ M$_{\\odot}$. The ionization in the outliers with increasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ may be due to late CSM interaction. $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ and its evolution are therefore key diagnostics of SLSN engines and progenitor mass loss."}

Existing analytic models often show large discrepancies with numerical relativity (NR) data, while data-driven models are limited to mass ratios of q<=8 (aligned spins) and q<=4 (precessing spins) and break down when extrapolated outside their training ranges. Using ~5000 of NR simulations from the SXS and RIT catalogs up to q=128 and ~100 black hole perturbation theory simulations up to q=200, we present two classes of models: (i) gwModel_kick_q200 (gwModel_kick_q200_GPR), an analytic (Gaussian process regression) model for aligned-spin binaries. (ii) gwModel_kick_prec_flow, a normalizing-flow model for kick distribution from precessing binaries with isotropic spins. Our approach combines analytic insights from post-Newtonian theory with data-driven techniques to ensure correct limiting behavior and high accuracy across parameter space. Both gwModel_kick_q200 and gwModel_kick_prec_flow are valid from comparable to extreme mass ratios. Extensive validation shows all three models outperform existing ones within their respective domains. Finally, using both back-of-the-envelope estimates and 1404 detailed star cluster simulations incorporating our kick models, we find that the black hole retention probability in low mass globular clusters can vary noticeably when the gwModel_kick_prec_flow model is employed.

The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a \"dark photosphere\" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors."}

Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $Ω=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable."}

The main axis of the projected halo distribution is more likely to align with the direction of the main cluster than to be oriented perpendicularly. Similar X-ray distributions have been identified in the literature on numerical simulations. The filamentary structure forms in the following manner: as the gas is stripped by ram pressure near the pericenter, it gets dragged by tidal rotation. Once free from this rotation, the gas moves inertially in a direction parallel to the tangential velocity at the pericenter. The comma-shaped gas, with tails pointing in the opposite direction to the main cluster, is also formed by the current tidal rotation as it moves away from the main cluster. This warrants us that, although it is sometimes thought based on the X-ray morphology alone that the tail is pointing in the opposite direction to the merger motion, this is not necessarily the case. The information of the X-ray filamentary remnant from the cluster merger, together with the 2D WL shear data, provides constraints on the merger parameters, indicating an infalling velocity of approximately $1000\\, {\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}$ and an impact parameter of $0.9$ Mpc."}

In this framework, the structures of the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses are determined entirely by the symmetry.

Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $Ω=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable."}

A generic prediction of the framework is the presence of a further light scalar state, the dilaton, which naturally couples weakly to the Higgs boson. The implementation of the framework usually requires the presence of a third, heavier state, which plays the role of dark matter and ensures the couplings run so that the multi-phase criticality condition is met. In this paper we consider the multi-phase criticality limit of an extension of the Standard Model including two extra scalar singlets, addressing the scenario with effective field theory methods that are particularly suited for treating the hierarchical mass spectrum that this construction yields. The analysis improves on the approximated results available in the Literature and explores the phenomenology of the model at collider and dark matter experiments. We find that the running of scalar couplings in the EFT between the two scales cannot be ignored, but the quantum corrections from the dark matter candidate are not noticeably modified."}

Our analysis reveals that the presence of primordial black holes can reduce the effective action and might modify the nucleation rate due to their gravitational effects, potentially altering the dynamics of the phase transition in the early universe and producing new gravitational wave signals since the gravitational effects of the primordial black hole or other possible inhomogeneous sources could lead to nucleation of non-spherical symmetric bubbles."}

The dataset combines observations from the MeerKAT, Nançay, Lovell, and Murriyang telescopes, spanning a total baseline of approximately 14 years. The glitch occurred on MJD~59942(17), with a measured fractional spin frequency step of $Δν_g / ν=1.15(13) \\times 10^{-12}$. This event represents the third glitch detected in a MSP, following those in PSRs B1821$-$24A and J0613$-$0200. Although smaller in amplitude than the previous two, the glitch in PSR J0900$-$3144 is of a comparable order of magnitude. The updated MSP glitch rate is $2.5(1)\\times 10^{-3}$ glitches per pulsar per year, which suggests it is likely current PTAs will detect another MSP glitch within five years. Using simulations, we demonstrate that such small glitches can go undetected, especially in short datasets such as those from new PTAs, and can bias the inferred achromatic noise model parameters, potentially leading to the down-weighting of the pulsar in gravitational wave background searches."}

Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray--only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available."}

Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters.
