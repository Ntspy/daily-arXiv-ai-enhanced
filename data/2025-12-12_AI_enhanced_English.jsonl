This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, a theoretical linkage to possible CPT violation, and most importantly, a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumotions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any masses $>1 eV/c^2$ would be inconsistent with upper limits from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A is too great for the method to work.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We consider such a system and investigate the effect this reduced spin has on the jet power and its dependence on the cosmic string tension, $\u03bc$.

Its spectrum transitions from a blue to red continuum with clear blueshifted Fe II and Si II broad absorption features, allowing for a SN Ic-BL classification. We do not detect any transient radio emission and rule out the existence of an on-axis, energetic jet $\\gtrsim 10^{50}~$erg. In the model we invoke, the collapse gives rise to a long-lived magnetar, potentially surrounded by an accretion disk. Magnetically-driven winds from the magnetar and the disk mix together, and break out with a velocity $\\sim 0.35c$ from an extended circumstellar medium with radius $\\sim 10^{13}$ cm, generating X-ray breakout emission through free-free processes. The disk outflows and magnetar winds power blackbody emission as they cool, producing the first peak in the SN LC.

Such spatially extended dark matter models lead to distinctive phenomenology in these detectors, particularly when the dark matter also interacts through long-range forces with their own characteristic length scales. In this work, we study the sensitivity of quantum sensor arrays to composite, ultraheavy dark matter interacting via both gravity and a novel Yukawa force.

A major challenge in achieving a complete SM prediction and interpreting this discrepancy lies in the treatment of nonlocal hadronic effects. In $B \\to K\\ell^+\\ell^-$, these effects are cast in a single nonlocal form factor, a function of squared momentum transfer $q^2$ to the lepton pair. One of the previously used methods provides this form factor in the region of spacelike momentum transfer, $q^2<0$, matching the result to the hadronic dispersion relation, which is then continued to the physical region. The calculation done so far was a combination of QCD factorisation for hard-gluon contributions with light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) for soft-gluon ones. In this work, we calculate for the first time the complete nonlocal form factor at $q^2<0$ for one of the effective operators, the chromomagnetic operator $O_{8g}$, applying the method of LCSRs with $ B$-meson distribution amplitudes. We compute, both analytically and numerically, the operator-product expansion (OPE) diagrams with hard-gluon exchanges, analyse their structure and hierarchy, and obtain their spectral density entering the LCSR together with soft-gluon contributions.
