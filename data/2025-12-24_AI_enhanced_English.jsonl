Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfv\u00e9nic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency.

To identify lensed SNe in large imaging datasets, current surveys primarily rely on the {\\it magnification} effect of gravitational lensing -- searching for transients that appear brighter than expected \\cite{c3}.

This proposed method is most applicable to space-based imaging surveys from wide-field imaging observatories such as the upcoming Roman Space Telescope. To train and test our network, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging surveys. Due to the extreme rarity of lensed SNe, we cannot train a neural network on actual lensed SN data. Instead, we have used HST imaging data to generate simulated imaging datasets for both training and testing. Our simulations use astrophysical priors to define the separations, relative brightnesses, and colors of each multiply-imaged SN. We have also simulated false positives (image artifacts and unlensed supernovae), which are much more prevalent than true lensed SN. Our deep learning model is trained to identify lensed SNe from a single difference image (i.e., not using multiple epochs). This network achieves a recall score of 99\\% on simulated gravitationally lensed SNe.

Overall, given an equation of state, pressure anisotropy can increase the maximum mass of an stable configuration by up to ~30 % compared to the isotropic case. It also allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales once they become unstable.

Recent geometric approaches based on conic hulls and triangulations provide a systematic framework for computing multiple MB integrals in terms of multivariate series. These approaches have so far been limited to MB integrals whose integrands are ratios of products of Euler's gamma functions only. However, in Feynman integral calculus, MB integrals with polygamma functions naturally arise, for instance, after resolving singularities in the dimensional-regularisation parameter $\u03b5$ and expanding the MB integrand in powers of $\u03b5$, as done by the public codes MB.m and MBresolve.m.

The suppression of the forward particles can be explained by an application of the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) of perturbative QCD. In this paper we investigate whether this type of analysis can be carried out also for top-quark jets with the much higher heavy quark mass allowing for QCD tests in this new kinematic regime.

Former studies have shown that unlike the uncertainties arising from thermal field theory, more diligence in the hydrodynamics can sometimes have limited benefit. However, this was shown in the context of broken power law fits. We test the benefits of some recent calculations in modeling the spectrum, including new developments in adjustments of the low frequency tail to be consistent with causality, but we use the full velocity profile. We find the spectral shape information has a heightened sensitivity to the speed of sound which can be demonstrated analytically, however for our benchmark model this still results in a modest difference. The reason for a heightened sensitivity is because the velocity at the boundary is quite sensitive to the speed of sound, which in turn means a small change to the speed of sound can have a large change to the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, even modest changes in the product $\u03b1\u03ba$ can make non-trivial changes to the shape around the peak. Finally, there are many points where adjusting the infrared behavior to be consistent with causality is affecting the spectrum near its peak.

Under such conditions, the standard framework of quantum field theory (QFT) requires a finite temperature extension, wherein propagators -- and hence the fundamental structure of the theory -- are modified to reflect thermal background effects. These thermal modifications are central to understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) as a high temperature phase transition, potentially leading to qualitatively different vacuum structures for the Higgs field as the universe cooled. Finite temperature corrections naturally regulate ultraviolet divergences in propagators, hinting at a possible route toward ultraviolet completion. However, these same thermal effects exacerbate infrared pathologies and can lead to imaginary contributions to the effective potential, particularly when analysing metastable or multi-vacuum configurations. Additional theoretical challenges, such as gauge dependence and renormalization scale ambiguity, further obscure the precise characterization of the electroweak phase transition even in minimal extensions of the Standard Model (SM). This review presents the theoretical foundations of finite temperature QFT with an emphasis on how different field species respond to thermal effects, identifying the bosonic sector as the primary source of key theoretical subtleties.

This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ''accidents'', which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles.
