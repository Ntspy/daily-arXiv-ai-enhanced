Abstract: We implemented a real-time data processor (rta-dp) framework that can be used
to develop real-time analysis pipelines and data handling systems to manage
high-throughput data streams with distributed applications in the context of
ground and space astrophysical projects and high-energy instruments. The rta-dp
is based on the ZeroMQ in-memory communication framework to receive input data,
share data between distributed processes, and send or receive commands and
pipeline configuration. The rta-dp framework has a flexible architecture that
allows the implementation of distributed analysis systems customized to the
requirements of several scenarios. The rta-dp framework also provides
monitoring capabilities for the running processes and sends housekeeping,
logging, alarms, and informative messages that a monitoring process can
acquire. We are using the rta-dp in several contexts, such as acquiring and
processing data from X-ray detectors to the data quality system of the ASTRI
Project, as well as reprocessing and archiving data.

### [2] [Event Reconstruction for Radio-Based In-Ice Neutrino Detectors with Neural Posterior Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03910)
*Nils Heyer,Christian Glaser,Thorsten Glüsenkamp,Martin Ravn*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep neural network for reconstructing UHE neutrino properties using in-ice radio arrays, achieving improved resolution over previous methods through neural posterior estimation with conditional normalizing flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHE neutrino detection is crucial for astrophysical studies, and existing reconstruction algorithms need improvement in accuracy and handling stochastic events like νe CC interactions.

Method: A deep neural network uses raw radio antenna waveforms to predict neutrino direction, energy, and topology, employing conditional normalizing flows for posterior PDF estimation to provide uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieved median resolutions of 0.30 log(E) and 18°² (shallow) / 0.08 log(E) and 28°² (deep) for NC events at 1 EeV. Successfully reconstructed νe CC events and evaluated systematic uncertainties with a goodness-of-fit score.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms prior approaches, enabling precise UHE neutrino reconstructions with uncertainty estimates, essential for next-gen experiments like those in Greenland/South Pole.

Abstract: The detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in the EeV range is the
goal of current and future in-ice radio arrays at the South Pole and in
Greenland. Here, we present a deep neural network that can reconstruct the main
neutrino properties of interest from the raw waveforms recorded by the radio
antennas: the neutrino direction, the energy of the particle shower induced by
the neutrino interaction, and the event topology, thereby estimating the
neutrino flavor. For the first time, we predict the full posterior PDF for the
energy and direction reconstruction via neural posterior estimation utilizing
conditional normalizing flows, enabling event-by-event uncertainty prediction.
We improve over previous reconstruction algorithms and obtain a median
resolution of 0.30 log(E) and 18 square degrees for a 'shallow' detector
component and 0.08 log(E) and 28 square degrees for a 'deep' detector component
for neutral current (NC) events at a shower energy of 1 EeV. This deep learning
approach also allows us to reconstruct the more stochastic $\nu_e$ - charged
current (CC) events. We quantify the impact of different antenna types and
systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction and derive a goodness-of-fit
score to test the compatibility of measured neutrino signals with the Monte
Carlo simulations used to train the neural network.

### [3] [Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04122)
*Adiba Amira Siddiqa,Sayed Shafaat Mahmud,Cosmin Ilie*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents a neural network trained on synthetic spectra of Dark Stars (DS) to identify spectroscopic DS candidates using JWST's NIRSpec data, validating the model against four Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates. It improves speed by 10,000x over prior methods and sets a foundation for large-scale cosmic exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect and characterize DS using spectroscopy and improve efficiency, enabling large-scale analysis of early-universe objects.

Method: Development of a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra; validation via application on four SMDS candidates from previous studies.

Result: Confirmed the four candidates' consistency with SMDS spectra; demonstrated ~10,000x faster parameter prediction than Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: The FFNN enables rapid DS analysis, suitable for Bayesian uncertainty studies and public NIRSpec data, advancing understanding of DS roles in cosmic evolution.

Abstract: Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM)
annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS),
offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the
formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants.
In \cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network
(FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize
dark star {\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data
taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to
identify {\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's
NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real
data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates
recently identified in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and
reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo
have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The
main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte
Carlo parameter estimator used in
\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach
introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster
than the traditional method used in
\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN
model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian
uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data
for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool
for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.

### [4] [Cutana: A High-Performance Tool for Astronomical Image Cutout Generation at Petabyte Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04429)
*Pablo Gómez,Laslo Erik Ruhberg,Kristin Anett Remmelgas,David O'Ryan*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Cutana is a memory-efficient tool for batch processing of large astronomical datasets like the Euclid Q1 release, enabling fast extraction of source-specific cutouts compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to process massive datasets such as Euclid Q1's 30 million sources efficiently, as existing tools like Astropy's Cutout2D are too slow for large-scale operations.

Method: Cutana uses vectorized NumPy operations for batch processing, memory-aware scheduling, and supports Zarr/FITS outputs with normalization schemes. It also includes a user interface for configuration and monitoring.

Result: Cutana outperforms Astropy, achieving near linear scaling and processing thousands of cutouts per second. It can process the entire Euclid Q1 in under four hours using four threads.

Conclusion: Cutana provides a scalable solution for big data astronomy, ready for integration with ESA's Datalabs and future releases like Euclid's DR1.

Abstract: The Euclid Quick Data Release 1 (Q1) encompasses 30 million sources across
63.1 square degrees, marking the beginning of petabyte-scale data delivery
through Data Release 1 (DR1) and subsequent releases. Systematic exploitation
of such datasets requires extracting millions of source-specific cutouts, yet
standard tools like Astropy's Cutout2D process sources individually, creating
bottlenecks for large catalogues. We introduce Cutana, a memory-efficient
software tool optimised for batch processing in both local and cloud-native
environments. Cutana employs vectorised NumPy operations to extract cutout
batches simultaneously from FITS tiles, implements automated memory-aware
scheduling, and supports both Zarr and FITS output formats with multiple common
normalisation schemes (asinh, log, zscale). Cutana outperforms Astropy in all
tested Q1 subset scenarios achieving near linear scaling and processing
thousands of cutouts per second. On just four worker threads, Cutana can
process all of Q1 in under four hours. The tool includes an ipywidget interface
for parameter configuration and real-time monitoring. Integration with ESA
Datalabs is underway for the Euclid DR1 release, with open-source release
pending ESA open-source licensing processes.

### [5] [Photon Orbit Signatures in Spectra of Black Hole Accretion Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03834)
*Daniel C. M. Palumbo,George N. Wong,Angelo Ricarte*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines how light paths and magnetic fields around accreting black holes affect synchrotron spectra. Using models and simulations, it identifies distinctive spectral signatures in flux and polarization, showing indirect images can dominate direct ones at certain frequencies. Observations above 300 GHz could detect photon rings without imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the spectral imprints caused by multiple light paths and varying magnetic fields near black holes, especially in the photon ring. Existing unresolved spectra may miss subtle effects which cumulative light paths introduce, necessitating the study for accurate observations.

Method: Three approaches are used: a minimal one-zone model isolating two sub-images to test magnetic field variations, a semi-analytic RIAF model showing frequency-dependent flux dominance of indirect images, and GRMHD simulations demonstrating spectral corrections. These methods analyze synchrotron spectra considering lensing effects.

Result: Spectral signatures in intensity and polarization emerge due to differing magnetic field angles along light paths. The first indirect image can surpass direct image brightness at specific frequencies. Corrections near the turnover frequency reach ~10% and increase with viewing angle. Significant effects occur at frequencies above 300 GHz.

Conclusion: Spectral studies above 300 GHz on M87* and Sgr A* can detect photon rings via spectral features, even without direct imaging. These findings highlight the importance of considering multi-path light effects in interpreting black hole observations.

Abstract: Light orbiting an accreting black hole may impact the disk or jet multiple
times before escaping to the observer, at a variety of angles with respect to
the local magnetic field. In this letter, we characterize the imprints of these
long path lengths and disparate magnetic field impacts in synchrotron spectra
of hot accretion disks, as the strongly lensed ``photon ring'' exhibits a
higher synchrotron turnover frequency in each lensed sub-image. We apply tools
of varying complexity: first, we develop a minimal, unlensed one-zone model
that isolates the first two sub-images of the accretion flow. By varying the
magnetic field geometry encountered by each sub-image, we show that distinctive
spectral signatures emerge in both total intensity and fractional linear
polarization. Second, we examine a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient
accretion flow (RIAF) model, in which we find that there is generally a
frequency at which the first indirect image outshines the direct image even in
total flux density. Lastly, we demonstrate that even general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation snapshots show this spectral character.
We find a typical correction to the unresolved spectrum of order $10\%$ near
the turnover frequency that grows with increasing viewing inclination, growing
to order unity at higher frequencies. We predict sensitive spectral studies of
the cores of Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* at frequencies exceeding $300$ GHz
to constrain the existence of the photon ring even without imaging, with
prospects for photon ring detection even in other sources with unresolved
shadows.

### [6] [Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03926)
*Yize Dong,V. Ashley Villar,Anya Nugent,Griffin Hosseinzadeh,Ryan J.

Jones,Chien-Cheng Lin,Michael Lundquist,Curtis McCully,Darshana Mehta,Anthony L. Piro,Aravind P. Ravi,Nicolás Meza Retamal,César Rojas-Bravo,S. Karthik Yadavalli,Qinan Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes SN 2024acyl, a Type Ibn supernova 35 kpc from its host galaxy, and identifies two spectral groups based on color and He I line width. Group I has bluer colors, narrower lines, and higher luminosity, while Group II (including SN 2024acyl) shows redder colors and broader lines. The diversity correlates with explosion and circumstellar conditions, suggesting progenitor mass, binary parameters, or different progenitor types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of Type Ibn supernovae and the cause of their observed diversity, particularly regarding progenitor identities and explosion mechanisms.

Method: 1. Observational analysis of SN 2024acyl's large offset and low local star-formation rate. 2. Spectral classification of Type Ibn SNe 20-35 days post-maximum light, grouping them by color, line width, and luminosity. 3. Comparing group characteristics with host galaxy environments and pre-explosion activity data.

Result: two distinct spectral groups (I and II) in Type Ibn SNe with persistent differences into late phases. No clear link to host environment/pre-explosion activity, but diversity correlated to CS material/energetics. SN 2024acyl placed in Group II. Progenitor diversity implied.

Conclusion: Type Ibn diversity likely stems from progenitor differences (binary configurations, helium star mass) impacting CS environment/explode energy. Further data needed to resolve continuity between groups or if they represent distinct channels.

Abstract: In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type
Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35~kpc) from its host
galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the
possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive
star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn
supernovae around 20--35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct
groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I
emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and
broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The
diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed
around peak and to persist into late phases ($>80$ days after peak). Given its
redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to
Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between
this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or
their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely
reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion
energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor
properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion
type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse
progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups
remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A head-tail galaxy is thought to be a radio galaxy with bent active galactic
nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of
head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of
shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and
cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail
galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega"
structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy
using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be
brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be
attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data
suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation
direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic
rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of
the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the
origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the
jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the
early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail
galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin
vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.

### [8] [Hadronic Processes in Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow as the Origin of TeV Excesses in BL Lac Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04202)
*Ji-Shun Lian,Ze-Rui Wang,Jin Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses a two-zone lepto-hadronic model to explain the TeV gamma-ray excess in BL Lac objects, attributing it to photomeson processes in ADAFs with specific proton spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observed TeV gamma-ray emission in some BL Lacs exceeds predictions of one-zone leptonic models, necessitating an alternative explanation.

Method: Selected five BL Lacs with hard TeV spectra; applied two-zone lepto-hadronic model where synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton explains lower energy bands, while photomeson (pγ) interactions in ADAFs account for TeV excess.

Result: Model successfully reproduces SEDs with protons having spectral index ~1.6-1.7 and cutoff energies 30-90 TeV. Cascaded electrons produce a keV-MeV bump but are outshone by jet emissions. Hadronuclear (pp) process is less favored due to requiring harder spectra.

Conclusion: Photomeson processes in ADAFs with specific proton acceleration mechanisms (magnetic reconnection/stochastic acceleration) likely explain TeV excess, offering a superior model over one-zone leptonic and pp alternatives.

Abstract: The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs)
exhibit an additional hard $\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that
surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of
this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs
whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and
successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic
model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV
$\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron
and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons
in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\gamma$-ray emission
resulting from the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process via $\pi^0$ decay occurring
within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a
hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff
energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius.
Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are
likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within
ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump
in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although
the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would
necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared
to the $p\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the
observed TeV excess.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dynamic processes in the accretion flow near black holes produce X-ray flux
variability, sometimes quasi-periodic. Determining its physical origin is key
to mapping accretion geometry but remains unresolved. We perform a novel
phase-resolved analysis on a newly discovered quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)
in the active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654. For the first time in a
supermassive black hole (SMBH), we detect a unique `U'-shaped QPO lag-energy
spectrum and observe coronal spectral variability over the QPO phase. We find
that the QPO is adequately explained by plasma resonant oscillations within a
corona. Modeling of QPO spectral properties and reverberation mapping reveal
that the corona is contracting and confined to only a few gravitational radii
regions near the SMBH, consistent with theoretical predictions for a decreasing
QPO period of near 10 minutes. These results present the first observational
evidence for an oscillating and contracting compact corona around an SMBH.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Thanks to a recent observation with XMM-Newton, we discovered periodic
pulsations at P= 9.6652 +/- 0.0002 s in a new ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX)
in the galaxy NGC 4631. This source, dubbed as X-8, shows one of the largest
spin-up rates ever observed, dP/dt = (-9.6 +/- 0.5)*1E-8 s/s. These findings
indicate that the compact object is a neutron star, and X-8 is a new member of
the pulsating ULX class. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity of X-8 is ~3.4E39 erg/s, and
its X-ray spectrum can be described by an absorbed disk blackbody or a cut-off
power law, similar to what is observed in other pulsating ULXs. We discuss two
possible causes for the large spin-up rate: Doppler shift from orbital motion
of the neutron star and intrinsic spin-up due to accretion torque. This new ULX
pulsar adds a key source to the small known population, and will enable future
studies to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for their
super-Eddington luminosities.

### [11] [The TeV emission of 3C273: inverse Compton radiation from shear-accelerated high-energy electrons in the large-scale jet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04433)
*F. Tavecchio*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study proposes that the VHE gamma-ray emission from 3C273 is generated in kiloparsec-scale jets via inverse Compton scattering of ultra-high-energy electrons accelerated by shear, linking it to X-ray knot emissions and suggesting a recollimation shock as a timescale explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observed VHE gamma rays in 3C273 don't align with standard blazar models of inner jets, requiring an alternative explanation for their origin and connection to X-ray emissions in large-scale jets.

Method: Proposes shear acceleration of electrons (γ~10^8) in kpc-scale jets producing inverse Compton emission. Links this to X-ray knots seen by Chandra in quasars, integrating emission from prominent 3C273 jet knots.

Result: The model explains VHE emission as summed emissions from two brightest knots. The ~3-year emission decay could stem from compact regions downstream of a recollimation shock.

Conclusion: Kpc-scale jet emission via shear-accelerated electrons provides a unified explanation for both VHE and X-ray observations, offering new insights into quasar jet dynamics.

Abstract: The VERITAS Collaboration recently reported the detection of very-high-energy
(VHE) gamma-ray emission from the prototypical radio quasar 3C273. The temporal
and the spectral properties of this component do not appear compatible with the
extrapolation of the beamed blazar-like emission of the inner, pc-scale jet. We
explore the possibility that the VHE component is produced in the jet at kpc
scale through the inverse Compton emission of a population of ultra-high energy
electrons (with Lorentz factor $\gamma\sim 10^8$). In the model these electrons
are accelerated through the shear acceleration mechanism, and they also account
for the still puzzling X-ray emission of knots detected by {\it Chandra} in the
large-scale jets of several powerful quasars (including 3C273). In our scenario
the VHE component can be interpreted as the integrated emission from the two
brightest knots of the 3C273 jet. We speculate that the decay of the emission
on the timescale of $\sim 3$ years could be accounted for by the scenario if
the VHE radiation is produced in some compact regions in the downstream flow of
a recollimation shock.

### [12] [Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources II: Joint detections of eccentricity and phase shifts in binary sub-populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04540)
*Lorenz Zwick,Kai Hendriks,Pankaj Saini,János Takátsy,Connar Rowan,Johan Samsing,Jakob Stegmann*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Eccentric gravitational wave (GW) signals improve the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental effects (EEs) by factors up to ℓ_max^(1−n), significantly boosting SNR. For high-eccentricity binaries (e ≳ 0.2), detectable phase shifts can be orders of magnitude smaller than in circular signals. Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET) are expected to ubiquitously observe EEs in eccentric binaries, even for typical scenarios like Roemer delays and gas drag, with SNR enhancements up to 10⁵. Current catalogs may already hint at EEs if some binaries form in AGN migration traps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how eccentricity affects the detectability of environmental effects on GW signals, which is crucial for interpreting upcoming observations from advanced detectors like CE and ET. Understanding this can help constrain astrophysical environments and formation channels of binary systems.

Method: The study modeled eccentric GW harmonics up to ℓ_max, considering frequency scaling (n) of dephasing effects from EEs. Population analyses were performed using eccentricity distributions for LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A#), CE, and ET sensitivities. Simulations evaluated detectability thresholds for phase shifts in high-eccentricity binaries.

Result: Eccentric signals boost EE-induced GW phase shift detectability via SNR enhancements of up to ℓ_max^(1−n). For typical EEs (e.g., Roemer delays), SNR increases by 10²−10⁵. High-eccentricity binaries (e ≳ 0.2) can detect phase shifts an order of magnitude smaller than circular signals. CE/ET will observe EEs as common features in eccentric mergers. Current data may show EEs if AGN traps contribute to some binaries.

Conclusion: Eccentricity dramatically enhances EE detection prospects, making future detectors like CE and ET essential for probing astrophysical environments. Observing EEs in eccentric binaries can reveal formation channels and environmental interactions, necessitating updated analysis frameworks to account for eccentricity-EE correlations.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the properties of eccentric gravitational wave (GW)
signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental
effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to
$\ell_{\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where
$\ell_{\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the
frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We
investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity
distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\#
sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope
(ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \gtrsim
0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\ell_{\rm max}^{1 -
n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be
detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect
amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET,
our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail
of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation
channel. Additionally, we find that the joint analysis of eccentricity and
phase shift is already plausible in current catalogs if a fraction of binaries
merge in AGN migration traps.

*Ryan Golant,Luca Comisso,Philipp Kempski,Lorenzo Sironi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper investigates intermittent collisionless turbulence in electron-positron plasmas through fully kinetic simulations, revealing modified magnetic field-curvature scalings and enhanced instability conditions compared to MHD. These findings impact cosmic ray dynamics in astrophysical contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome MHD's limitations in describing collisionless plasma environments common in the universe, the study explores how kinetic effects influence turbulent structures critical for particle acceleration.

Method: 3D fully kinetic simulations of electron-positron plasmas varying δB/B₀ and scale separations, analyzing pressure anisotropy effects on magnetic field curvature and instabilities.

Result: Pressure anisotropy steepens B ∝ K_∥^(-3/4) scaling, hardens curvature PPDF slope from -2.5 to -2.0, and increases mirror/firehose instability volumes with higher δB/B₀.

Conclusion: Kinetic effects in collisionless turbulence significantly affect magnetic structures and instabilities, altering particle transport/acceleration mechanisms in interstellar/intracluster media.

Abstract: Large-amplitude turbulence -- characterized by a fluctuating magnetic field
component, $\delta B$, that is stronger than the mean component, $B_0$ -- is
generically intermittent, populated with intense localized structures such as
sharp field-line bends and rapid field reversals. Recent MHD simulations
suggest that these structures play an important role in particle transport and
acceleration; however, MHD is inapplicable in most of our Universe, where the
plasma is so hot or diffuse that Coulomb collisions are negligible. Therefore,
in this paper, we analyze the intermittent properties of collisionless
large-amplitude turbulence in electron-positron plasmas via fully kinetic 3D
simulations, exploring a wide range of $\delta B / B_0$ and scale separations
between the turbulence driving scale, $L$, and kinetic scales, $c/\omega_{\rm
p}$. The steady-state collisionless turbulence in our simulations broadly
resembles that of MHD, but the development of pressure anisotropy steepens the
scaling between magnetic field strength, $B$, and scalar field-line curvature,
$K_\parallel$ -- yielding $B \propto K_\parallel^{-3/4}$ -- and consequently
modifies the power-law slope of the probability density function of
$K_\parallel$; this slope hardens from $K_\parallel^{-2.5}$ to
$K_\parallel^{-2.0}$ as $\delta B / B_0$ increases from 4 to 140. Pressure
anisotropy also triggers mirror and firehose instabilities, with the
volume-filling fractions of these fluctuations increasing with $\delta B /
B_0$; for our largest $\delta B / B_0$, $20\%$ of the volume is mirror-unstable
and $6\%$ is firehose-unstable. Both the curvature and the Larmor-scale
fluctuations in collisionless large-amplitude turbulence are expected to
significantly influence cosmic ray transport and acceleration in the
interstellar medium of our Galaxy and the intracluster medium of galaxy
clusters.

Abstract: We present an analytic, first-order description of how black hole ringdown
imprints on the operational signature of near-horizon thermality. Building on a
static Schwarzschild baseline in which a freely falling two-level system
coupled to a single outgoing mode exhibits geometric photon statistics and a
detailed-balance ratio set by the surface gravity, we introduce an even-parity,
axisymmetric quadrupolar perturbation and work in an ingoing
Eddington-Finkelstein, horizon-regular framework. The perturbation corrects the
outgoing eikonal through a gauge-invariant double-null contraction of the
metric, yielding a compact redshift map that, when pulled back to the detector
worldline, produces a universal, decaying-oscillatory modulation of the
Boltzmann exponent at the quasinormal frequency. We derive a closed boundary
formula for the response coefficient at the sampling radius, identify the
precise adiabatic window in which the result holds, and prove that the
modulation vanishes in all stationary limits. Detector specifics (gap,
switching wavepacket width) enter only through a smooth prefactor, while the
geometric content is captured by the quasinormal pair and the response
coefficient. The analysis clarifies that near-horizon "thermality" is robust
but not rigid: detailed balance persists as the organizing structure and is
gently driven by ringdown dynamics. The framework is minimal yet extensible to
other multipoles, parities, and slow rotation, and it suggests direct numerical
and experimental cross-checks in controlled analog settings.

*Amitayus Banik,Jeong Han Kim,Xing-Yu Yang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates a binary system consisting of a boson star (formed from ultra-light dark matter) and a central black hole. Numerical and analytical methods are used to explore system configurations, density profiles, and gravitational wave dephasing effects for potential detection via LISA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure and dynamics of self-gravitating ULDM boson stars around black holes, and to explore how such systems could be detected through gravitational wave observations.

Method: Numerically solving hydrostatic equilibrium equations in the non-relativistic limit, incorporating black hole gravity. Developed an analytic density profile model and performed Fisher matrix analysis for gravitational wave dephasing.

Result: Successful numerical solutions showing possible BS-BH configurations. Analytic model matches numerical results for attractive interactions and certain mass ratios. Fisher analysis identified parameter spaces detectable by LISA.

Conclusion: BS-BH systems with ULDM could provide observable gravitational wave signatures. The study highlights LISA's potential to probe ULDM properties through dephasing measurements, opening new avenues for dark matter detection.

Abstract: We study a system of a self-gravitating condensate, a boson star, formed from
scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM), with a black hole hosted at its center.
We numerically solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the
non-relativistic limit, consistently incorporating the gravitational potential
of the black hole, to obtain all possible configurations of this BS-BH system
for different boson star masses, interaction types, and black hole masses. We
also propose an analytic expression for the density profile and compare it with
the numerical results, finding good agreement for attractive interactions and
for a finite range of mass ratios between the black hole and boson star.
Finally, considering the inspiral of this BS-BH system with a second, smaller
black hole, we study the dephasing of gravitational waves due to the presence
of the ULDM environment. A Fisher matrix analysis reveals the regions of
parameter space of the ULDM mass and self-coupling that future
gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA can probe.

*Akhil Uniyal,Indu K. Dihingia,Yosuke Mizuno,Luciano Rezzolla*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how future telescope projects like ngEHT and BHEX can distinguish between different black hole images, showing that a 2-5% image mismatch can effectively test deviations from the Kerr solution in general relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the capability of upcoming missions to distinguish black hole images and thereby test theories of gravity, especially identifying deviations from the Kerr metric.

Method: Used general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and radiative-transfer simulations to generate images of accreting BHs differing from Kerr. Calculated image mismatches using various metrics.

Result: Future missions can differentiate non-Kerr BHs when image mismatches exceed 2-5%, depending on the comparison metric, requiring percent-level image fidelity for meaningful gravitational tests.

Conclusion: Future horizon-scale imaging with improved fidelity will allow robust observational constraints on strong-field general relativity predictions and deviations from the Kerr metric.

Abstract: The horizon-scale images of supermassive black holes (BHs) by
  the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) have provided new
  opportunities to test general relativity and other theories of
  gravity. In view of future projects, such as the next-generation Event
  Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Black-Hole Explorer (BHEX), having
  the potential of enhancing our ability to probe extreme gravity, it is
  natural to ask: \textit{how much can two black-hole images differ?} To
  address this question and assess the ability of these projects to test
  theories of gravity with black-hole shadows, we use
  general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and radiative-transfer
  simulations to investigate the images of a wide class of accreting BHs
  deviating from the Kerr solution. By measuring the mismatch between
  images of different BHs we show that future missions will be able to
  distinguish a large class of BHs solutions from the Kerr solution when
  the mismatch in the images exceeds values between $2\%$ and $5\%$
  depending on the image-comparison metric considered. These
  results indicate future horizon-scale imaging with percent-level
  image fidelity can place meaningful observational constraints on
  deviations from the Kerr metric and thereby test strong-field
  predictions of general relativity.

Abstract: We examine the claimed observations of a gravitational external field effect
(EFE) reported in Chae et al. We show that observations suggestive of the EFE
can be interpreted without violating Einstein's equivalence principle, namely
from known correlations between morphology, environment and dynamics of
galaxies. While Chae et al's analysis provides a valuable attempt at a clear
test of Modified Newtonian Dynamics, an evidently important topic, a

the presence of an EFE or to distinguish this interpretation from that proposed

TL;DR: The paper explores spacetime metrics that mimic black holes without an event horizon, examines their scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and observational signatures like shadows and echoes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study singularity-free, geodesically complete spacetime metrics that lack an event horizon and understand their properties through perturbations and observational features.

Method: Analyzing metrics without Z_2 symmetry, studying effective radial potentials for scalar perturbations across different metric configurations, investigating quasinormal modes, and examining observable characteristics like shadows and echoes.

Result: Identified how varying metrics affect radial potentials and quasinormal modes, explored the possibility of observational signatures such as altered shadows and potential echo effects absence/presence.

Conclusion: Mimicker metrics offer a viable alternative to black holes, with distinct observational features that could be tested against astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of
black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are
constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically
complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and
may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on
scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting
effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the
mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes
and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for
potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the
possible presence or absence of echo effects.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores charged black holes in Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), showing how the coupling parameter α and charge Q affect thermal stability, light deflection, shadow geometry, and quantum properties. Observational tests for STVG are proposed using gravitational lensing and accretion disk data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate STVG theory by identifying distinct observational signatures in black hole physics, addressing limitations of Einstein's gravity and providing testable predictions for upcoming astronomical observations.

Method: Topological analysis of STVG black holes using Gauss-Bonnet theorem, quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms, calculations of gravitational lensing, shadow geometry, Hawking emission, and accretion disk simulations.

Result: α enhances thermal stability and light deflection/shadow size, while Q reduces them. Phase transitions in microscopic regimes occur. Certain α-Q combinations can mimic Kerr black hole radiation patterns, complicating observational identification. Concrete tests via upcoming telescopes are outlined.

Conclusion: STVG produces unique observable features in black hole systems that diverge from Einstein's predictions, offering pathways to confirm or constrain the theory through next-generation astronomical data.

Abstract: We explore charged black holes in Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG),
unveiling their distinctive features across multiple physical domains. Our
topological analysis reveals that the STVG coupling parameter $\alpha$ bolsters
thermal stability while electromagnetic charge $Q$ weakens it. Using the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we find that $\alpha$ amplifies light deflection and
enlarges shadow silhouettes, with $Q$ generating opposite effects. Our
quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms pinpoint phase
transitions in the microscopic regime, modifying conventional thermodynamic
relationships. Calculations of strong gravitational lensing, shadow geometry,
and Hawking emission show clear STVG signatures that diverge from Einstein's
predictions. Notably, our accretion disk analysis uncovers an intriguing
phenomenon: specific combinations of $\alpha$ and $Q$ can produce radiation
patterns resembling spinning Kerr black holes, creating potential
identification challenges for observers. These findings establish concrete
observational tests for STVG theory through next generation astronomical
imaging and lensing campaigns. By connecting theoretical predictions to
measurable quantities, we outline specific pathways to confirm or constrain
STVG using data from current and future space telescopes.

### [20] [Apparent horizon as a membrane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03959)
*Daniel R. Terno*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the near-horizon geometry of physical black holes formed from collapse, deriving their properties and comparing them to eternal black holes. It introduces a membrane description with viscous stress tensors and recovers surface gravity through near-horizon acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the observable differences between physical (formed by collapse) and eternal black holes by analyzing their near-horizon geometries and developing a consistent membrane model.

Method: Constructing an approximate near-horizon metric for physical black holes, deriving expressions for redshift, proper acceleration, extrinsic curvature, and assigning a 2D viscous-fluid stress tensor using junction conditions. Also, analyzing dynamical generalizations of surface gravity.

Result: Closed-form expressions for key geometric quantities, a membrane description framework with viscous stress tensors, insights into Rindler-near-horizon geometry relations, and confirmation of surface gravity via near-horizon acceleration.

Conclusion: The membrane paradigm approach successfully models physical black holes' dynamics, highlighting unique properties distinct from eternal black holes and providing a new perspective on surface gravity and geometry relations.

Abstract: The requirement that a trapped spacetime domain forms in finite time for
distant observers is logically possible and sometimes unavoidable, but its
consequences are not yet fully understood. In spherical symmetry, the
characterization of the near-horizon geometry of these physical black holes is
complete and shows marked differences from their eternal counterparts. Whether
these differences lead to observable signatures remains unclear. We construct
an approximate near-horizon metric that encapsulates them and is suitable for
modeling. The timelike apparent horizon of physical black holes provides a
natural surface for a consistent membrane description: we obtain closed-form
expressions for the redshift, proper acceleration, and extrinsic curvature, and
assign a two-dimensional viscous-fluid stress tensor via junction conditions.
These results also provide an additional perspective on the relation between
Rindler and near-horizon geometries. Among dynamical generalizations of surface
gravity, only a subset applies to these models. We complete their analysis and
recover the intuitive definition of surface gravity -- the acceleration in the
frame of a near-horizon observer, redshifted to infinity -- directly from the
membrane acceleration.

### [21] [Scalar superradiance in the charged black-bounce spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04007)
*Zhiming Shuai,Xiangdong Zhang,Gui-Rong Liang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how a charged scalar field's superradiant amplification and black hole bomb mechanisms are affected by a quantum parameter (λ) in a charged black-bounce spacetime. Key findings include weakened superradiance due to the parameter's effect on the effective potential, differing influences of field/black hole charge on frequency ranges, and distinct eigen-modes in Type I vs. Type II bomb configurations with no amplification observed in high mass scenarios for Type II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of quantum parameters (λ) and other factors on superradiance phenomena in charged black-bounce spacetimes, which could provide insights into quantum gravity effects and black hole stability.

Method: Numerical investigations of charged scalar field scattering and black hole bomb models (Type I and II) in charged black-bounce spacetimes. Analyzed effects of parameters like λ, field mass, charges, and mirror positions on superradiant amplification and eigen-modes.

Result: Superradiant amplification is weakened by λ and field mass across all frequencies. Black hole/field charge affects high vs. low frequency regions differently. Type I bombs show new eigen-modes at high λ, absent in Type II. Heavy field masses in Type II configurations prevent amplification.

Conclusion: Quantum parameters significantly modulate superradiance and black hole bomb dynamics, suggesting that quantum effects can suppress instabilities. The findings highlight parameter dependencies critical for understanding black hole physics in quantum gravity frameworks.

Abstract: We numerically investigate the superradiant amplification effect of a charged
scalar filed in the scattering experiment and the black hole bomb model in a
charged black-bounce spacetime. Due to the shallowing effect on the effective
potential by the introduced quantum parameter $\l$, superradiance in both the
above cases are verified to be weakened. In a scattering experiment, the
quantum parameter and the field mass suppress the amplification in all
frequency ranges, while the black hole and field charge influence it
differently in high and low frequencies. In a Type I black hole bomb model,
where the reflective mirror is placed outside the ergo-region, we find a new
distinct eigen-mode for the scalar field evolution in a high $\l$ value, which
is however absent in the case of Type II black bomb where the mirror is set
inside the ergo-region. Moreover, we investigate the heavy field mass scenario
in a Type II black hole bomb and find no amplification effect in this confined
configuration.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: According to General Relativity (GR), gravitational waves (GWs) should travel
at the speed of light $c$. However, some theories beyond GR predict deviations
of the velocity of GWs $c_{\rm gw}$ from $c$, and some of those expect vacuum
dispersion. Therefore, probing the propagation effects of GWs by comparing the
wave format detectors against the one at emission excepted from GR. Since such
propagation effects accumulate through larger distance, it is expected that
super-massive black holes binary (SMBHB) mergers serve as better targets than
their stellarmass equivalent. In this paper, we study with simulations on how
observations on a population of SMBHs can help to study this topic. We simulate
LISA observations on three possible SMBHB merger populations, namely
Pop\MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 3}, Q3-nod and Q3-d over a 5-year mission. The
resulting constraints on the graviton mass are \(9.50\), \(9.33\), and \(9.05
\times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{eV}/c^2\), respectively. We also obtain the
corresponding constraints on the dispersion coefficients assuming different
dispersion scenarios. If the electromagnetic wave counterparts of SMBHB merger
can be detected simultaneously, the $c_{\rm gw}$ can be constrained
waveform-independently to \(\Delta c/c\) to \(10^{-13}-10^{-12}\),
corresponding to graviton mass constraints of \(10^{-26}-10^{-24}
\mathrm{eV}/c^2\).

*Dražen Glavan,Alexander Vikman,Tom Zlosnik*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the accretion of a complex scalar field with a global U(1) symmetry onto a Schwarzschild black hole, finding that beyond the gradient expansion's lowest order, accretion rates drop compared to perfect fluid models, suggesting black holes can distinguish between perfect fluids and their scalar field counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how relativistic Bondi accretion differs when considering a complex scalar field instead of a perfect fluid, and to assess whether black hole accretion observations could probe the underlying field's ultraviolet structure.

Method: The study uses the test-field approximation for spherically symmetric, stationary accretion of a complex scalar field with canonical kinetic terms and quartic potentials (with or without spontaneous symmetry breaking). The analysis goes beyond the gradient expansion's lowest order to compare with perfect fluid results.

Result: Accretion rates of the scalar field are systematically lower than perfect fluid models when higher-order gradient terms are included, indicating that deviations from perfect fluid behavior can be observed through accretion dynamics.

Conclusion: Black hole accretion observations may distinguish between perfect fluid and complex scalar field models, highlighting the importance of considering ultraviolet completions in cosmological and astrophysical scenarios.

Abstract: Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and
astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such
a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field
approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a
simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with
canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either
preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is
well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such
a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate
that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate
with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to
distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the
complex scalar field.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: It is widely believed that Sgr A$^*$, located at the center of our Galaxy, is
a supermassive black hole. Recent observations of its shadow and long-term
monitoring of the S2 star have provided compelling evidence supporting this
hypothesis. These observational advancements also offer valuable opportunities
to explore the physical properties of the black hole and its surrounding
environment. Since a dark matter halo is expected to exist in the Milky Way and
around Sgr A$^*$, investigating the behavior of the Galactic Center black hole
embedded in such a halo provides a crucial means to simultaneously probe both
black hole physics and dark matter properties. In this work, We develop a black
hole metric that incorporates a generalized double power law dark matter halo,
and analyze the corresponding null and timelike geodesics to investigate how
the halo parameters affect the black hole shadow and the motion of the S2 star.
Furthermore, by comparing our theoretical predictions with observational data
of the shadow and the S2 orbit, we constrained the dark matter halo parameters.
The results of this study provide both theoretical and phenomenological
insights into the nature of Sgr A$^*$ and the distribution of dark matter in
our Galaxy.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a geometric framework (MPS) that connects spacetime curvature with thermodynamic behavior of massive particles around black holes, showing synchronization of geometric quantities with phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the known correspondence between Gaussian curvature and Lyapunov exponent from null orbits to timelike orbits and explore its implications for black hole thermodynamics.

Method: Introduced the massive particle surface (MPS) framework and constructed a geometric quantity G, demonstrating its proportionality to -λ² on unstable timelike orbits. Analyzed behavior near first-order phase transitions.

Result: Showed G synchronizes with λ's multivaluedness near phase transitions, yielding critical exponent δ=1/2, proving geometry encodes thermodynamic info.

Conclusion: Successfully extended geometry-dynamics correspondence to massive particles, providing a geometric approach to study black hole phase transitions.

Abstract: The deep connection between black hole thermodynamics and spacetime geometry
remains a central focus of general relativity. While recent studies have
revealed a precise correspondence for null orbits, given by $K = -\lambda^2$
between the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, its
validity for timelike orbits had remained unknown. Our work introduces the
massive particle surface (MPS) framework and constructs a new geometric
quantity $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{G} \propto -\lambda^2$ on
unstable timelike orbits, thus establishing the geometry-dynamics
correspondence for massive particles. Crucially, near the first-order phase
transition of a black hole, $\mathcal{G}$ displays synchronized multivalued
behavior with the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and yields a critical exponent
$\delta=1/2$. Our results demonstrate that spacetime geometry encodes
thermodynamic information, opening a new pathway for studying black hole phase
transitions from a geometric perspective.

### [26] [Equivalence of scalar-tensor theories and scale-dependent gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04467)
*Philipp Neckam,Christian Käding,Benjamin Koch,Cristobal Laporte,Mario Pitschmann,Ali Riahinia,Angel Rincon*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper establishes an equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and a subset of scalar-tensor theories, showing bidirectional mappings between their actions and field equations while highlighting their dynamical and structural relationships. Key findings include the promotion of the scale-setting function k(x) to a dynamical field in the action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and formalize the relationship between scale-dependent gravity theories and scalar-tensor theories, aiming to unify their frameworks and clarify their interconvertibility. This addresses the need to understand how different gravitational theories can be expressed in terms of each other and how dynamical aspects like conformal couplings emerge.

Method: The method involves constructing mathematical mappings between scale-dependent gravity actions and scalar-tensor actions with canonical kinetic terms. The authors derive equivalence at both the action level and field equations level, analyze the uniqueness of embedding scale-dependent theories into scalar-tensor frameworks, and examine the dynamics of the scale-setting function k(x) by introducing a kinetic term for it.

Result: Results confirm a unique embedding of well-behaved scale-dependent theories into scalar-tensor theories but show scalar-tensor theories can map to scale-dependent ones in multiple ways. The dynamic treatment of k(x) as a field and the compatibility with existing equivalences to f(R) gravity are key outcomes. Explicit examples validate the equivalence framework.

Conclusion: The conclusion affirms the robust equivalence between the two theories, emphasizing its implications for unifying gravitational frameworks and offering a new tool for translating models between them. This allows for leveraging insights from one theory to the other, potentially simplifying model analysis and enabling cross-theoretical comparisons.

Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and
scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical
kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric
tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent
gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique
way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a
scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of
the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context
of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to
a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic
term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new
equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the
aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence
relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and
scalar-tensor theories.

Motivation: Understanding the behavior of relativistic objects in strong gravitational fields. Testing equilibrium configurations of extended matter distributions in Kerr spacetime.

Result: Derived analytical frequency expressions for fundamental modes under both types of perturbations. Established stability criteria for the rotating loops based on perturbation responses.

Conclusion: Circular string loops in Kerr spacetime exhibit distinct stability properties depending on rotation parameters. Derived oscillation frequencies provide new insights into matter dynamics near rotating black holes.

Abstract: We study stability of the circular string loops rotating in the equatorial

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper establishes a formalism connecting modified entropy functions to spacetime metrics and entropic matter, addressing inconsistencies in black hole physics through an emergent anisotropic fluid derived from entropy derivatives. Applying this to various modified entropy models, it derives their effective matter sectors and examines their physical viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve inconsistencies in black hole physics arising from modified entropy models by establishing a consistent framework linking entropies to spacetime and matter.

Method: Starting from the first law of black hole thermodynamics, the authors derive a correspondence between entropy derivatives and spacetime metrics, forming an emergent stress-energy tensor as an effective anisotropic fluid. They apply this to several modified entropy models including Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Rényi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications.

Result: Demonstrates that modified entropy models generate distinct effective matter sectors with anisotropic fluid properties. Analysis confirms these satisfy energy conditions in certain regimes, offering solutions to previous inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The formalism successfully links modified entropies to viable entropic matter sectors, providing a robust framework to test and interpret entropy modifications in black hole physics without contradictions.

Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to
a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of
entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity,
starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an
explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function,
which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an
anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may
resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with
modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide
class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis,
logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications,
and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical
properties and energy conditions.

Conclusion: Lorentz-Finsler geometry offers a powerful, flexible toolset with wide applicability in both theoretical and applied physics, suggesting promising future research directions in quantum gravity and discretized spacetime models.

Abstract: Finslerian extensions of Special and General Relativity -- commonly referred
to as Very Special and Very General Relativity -- necessitate the development
of a unified Lorentz-Finsler geometry. However, the scope of this geometric
framework extends well beyond relativistic physics. Indeed, it offers powerful
tools for modeling wave propagation in classical mechanics, discretizing
spacetimes in classical and relativistic settings, and supporting effective
theories in fundamental physics. Moreover, Lorentz-Finsler geometry provides a
versatile setting that facilitates the resolution of problems within
Riemannian, Lorentzian, and Finslerian geometries individually. This work
presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts,
key applications, and future prospects.
  The reviewed topics include (i) basics on the setting of cones, Finsler and
Lorentz-Finsler metrics and their (nonlinear, anisotropic and linear)
connections, (ii) the global structure of Lorentz-Finsler manifolds and its
space of null geodesics, (iii) links among Riemannian, Finsler and Lorentz
geometries, (iv) real world applications for wildfires and seisms, and
discretization in classical and relativistic settings with quantum prospects,
and (v) Finslerian variational approach to Einstein equations. The new results
include the splitting of globally hyperbolic Finsler spacetimes, in addition to
the analysis of several extensions as the case of timelike boundaries.

### [30] [Twist and higher modes of a complex scalar field at the threshold of collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04649)
*Krinio Marouda,Daniela Cors,Hannes R. Rüter,Alex Vaño-Viñuales,David Hilditch*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies the threshold of collapse for a massless complex scalar field in axisymmetric spacetimes with varying angular modes (m=1 and m=2). They find that critical exponents and echoing periods depend on m, maintaining universality within each mode but not across them, and rule out extremal black holes at the threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous research on gravitational collapse by exploring higher angular modes and understanding how angular momentum affects critical phenomena and black hole formation.

Method: Using the pseudospectral code 'm-cartoon' along with a twist-compatible apparent horizon finder to simulate near-critical initial data for m=1 and m=2 modes. They analyze the scaling laws and horizon properties.

Result: For m=1, recovered known values of Δ≈0.42 and γ≈0.11. For m=2, found smaller Δ≈0.09 and γ≈0.035. Angular momentum's effect was minimal at collapse threshold, leading to non-extremal black holes.

Conclusion: Critical behavior (DSS and scaling) holds within each m-mode but varies between them. Angular momentum does not cause extremal horizons or bifurcations in this model.

Abstract: We investigate the threshold of collapse of a massless complex scalar field
in axisymmetric spacetimes under the ansatz of Choptuik et al. 2004, in which a
symmetry depending on the azimuthal parameter $m$ is imposed on the scalar
field. This allows for both non-vanishing twist and angular momentum. We extend
earlier work to include higher angular modes. Using the pseudospectral code
bamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon,
and a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve
near-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest
nontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete
self-similarity with echoing period $\Delta\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling
with exponent $\gamma\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work. For $m=2$ we
find that universality is maintained within this nonzero fixed-$m$ symmetry
class but with smaller period and critical exponents, $\Delta\simeq0.09$ and
$\gamma\simeq0.035$, establishing an explicit dependence of the critical
solution on the angular mode. Analysis of the relation between the angular
momentum and the mass of apparent horizons at the instant of formation,
$J_{\mathrm{AH}}{-}M_{\mathrm{AH}}$, shows that the effect of angular momentum
is minimal at the threshold, with
$\chi_{\mathrm{AH}}=J_{\mathrm{AH}}/M_{\mathrm{AH}}^2\to0$, and, therefore,
excludes extremal black holes for the families under consideration. Our results
demonstrate that while universality and DSS hold within each $m$-sector, the
critical universal values vary with $m$, and neither extremality nor
bifurcation occur in the complex scalar field model within the families
considered here.

### [31] [Asymptotic Freedom for Holographic Energy Correlators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03778)
*Csaba Csáki,Ameen Ismail,Larissa Kiriliuk*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines energy correlators in a holographic model that combines asymptotic freedom and confinement by modifying the AdS geometry with a logarithmically varying warp factor. The model interpolates between a Randall-Sundrum hard wall and a running coupling geometry. Shockwave analysis reveals a decaying correlator at small angles and exponential falloff in the back-to-back limit, differing from AdS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model QCD-like theories incorporating both asymptotic freedom and confinement, which are challenging to study in pure AdS. Existing models (e.g., hard wall) lack running couplings, so this hybrid geometry aims to bridge these phenomena in holographic QCD.

Method: Develop a bulk metric with a logarithmically running warp factor connecting Randall-Sundrum and AdS-like geometries. Use numerical methods to solve shockwave profiles from a high-energy scalar source, computing the resulting two-point energy correlators.

Result: The energy correlator decays at small angular separations due to the running coupling, contrasting AdS's flat correlator. In the back-to-back limit, an exponential falloff similar to hard-wall models emerges, indicating confinement effects.

Conclusion: Holographic models with geometry-modulated running couplings can capture both asymptotic freedom and confinement behaviors. Numerical shockwave methods provide insights into energy correlator structures beyond traditional AdS/QCD approaches.

Abstract: We calculate energy correlators in a holographic model incorporating elements
of asymptotic freedom and confinement. We model a running coupling by
considering a geometry with a warp factor that deviates logarithmically from
anti-de Sitter (AdS). A novel aspect of our bulk metric is that it smoothly
interpolates between a Randall-Sundrum solution with a hard wall and a geometry
corresponding to a logarithmic running typical of gauge theories. By studying
shockwave deformations of this metric, we compute a two-point energy correlator
assuming a high-energy scalar source. This extends techniques recently
developed for correlators in asymptotically AdS geometries. We use numerical
methods to find the profile of shockwaves along the extra dimension, as it does
not admit an analytical form. The running coupling leads to a decay of the
two-point correlator at small angular separation, unlike the flat correlator
one finds in AdS. In the back-to-back limit we observe an exponential falloff
similar to other hard-wall models.

### [32] [Direct Detection of Mechanism-Agnostic Fast-Moving Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03780)
*Haider Alhazmi,Doojin Kim,Kyoungchul Kong,Aishah Sumayli*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for interpreting electron recoil signals from fast-moving dark matter, covering relativistic kinematics and atomic effects. It emphasizes the importance of this approach for distinguishing boosted DM scenarios and highlights the complementary roles of direct detection and neutrino experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to address alternative dark matter scenarios beyond traditional WIMPs, especially those involving boosted DM from annihilation, decay, or acceleration. Existing experiments' null results prompt a reevaluation of detection strategies for relativistic DM.

Method: The framework uses relativistic kinematics and ionization form factors to model electron recoils, accounting for atomic effects at low energies and transitioning to free-electron approximations at high energies. It provides differential cross-section predictions for both detection regimes.

Result: Shows atomic effects diminish at high energies, validating simplified models in certain regions. Demonstrates how experiments with differing thresholds (low vs. high) can synergize to probe a wider range of DM kinematic parameters.

Conclusion: The formalism offers a model-independent tool for current and future searches of relativistic DM, facilitating unified interpretation of experimental results across diverse detection methods.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for interpreting electron recoil signals
induced by fast-moving dark matter (DM), applicable across a wide range of
theoretically motivated models. Amid both null results in conventional weakly
interacting massive particle searches and growing interest in alternative DM
scenarios, we focus on (semi-)relativistic DM components that can arise from
mechanisms such as DM annihilation, decay, or cosmic-ray acceleration. These
boosted DM candidates produce distinct experimental signatures that differ
qualitatively from non-relativistic DM, necessitating a dedicated treatment.
Our framework incorporates relativistic kinematics and atomic effects through
ionization form factors, enabling accurate predictions of differential cross
sections in both low- and high-energy regimes. We demonstrate how atomic
effects become negligible at high recoil energies, validating the free-electron
approximation in specific parameter regions. Furthermore, we highlight the
complementarity between low-threshold direct detection experiments and
high-threshold neutrino observatories in probing fast-moving DM across broad
kinematic domains. This formalism provides a robust and model-independent
foundation for interpreting current and future searches for relativistic DM.

### [33] [Light new physics and the $τ$ lepton dipole moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03786)
*Martin Hoferichter,Gabriele Levati*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the challenges in testing new-physics scenarios involving third-generation particles like the tau lepton, focusing on contributions from light new particles (spin-0 and spin-1 bosons) to tau dipole moments. It provides a detailed interpretation of asymmetry measurements in e+e-→τ+τ- processes for extracting dipole moments and explores decoupling to the effective field theory (EFT) limit. A key application is the study of a tauphilic vector boson at Belle II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome experimental difficulties in testing third-generation new-physics scenarios, particularly comparing tau lepton dipole moment constraints to those of lighter leptons. Existing methods relying on EFT require a sufficiently large NP scale, limiting their applicability. This work aims to enable analysis of light NP contributions directly and provide model-specific insights.

Method: The authors perform a comprehensive analysis of light NP scenarios contributing to tau dipole moments, focusing on e+e-→τ+τ- process asymmetries. They consider specific cases of new spin-0 and spin-1 bosons, study their decoupling to the EFT limit, and compare with constraints from other processes. A tauphilic gauge vector boson is studied in detail as a case study for Belle II.

Result: The analysis clarifies the interpretation of asymmetry measurements for extracting dipole moments from tau pair production. It shows how light NP contributions differ from EFT predictions and demonstrates the complementarity of constraints from different processes. The tauphilic vector boson case provides concrete examples of parameter spaces probed by Belle II reachable with upcoming datasets.

Conclusion: The work establishes a framework for testing light NP contributions to tau dipole moments through precision measurements in e+e- colliders. It emphasizes the importance of considering both model-independent EFT approaches and model-specific scenarios, especially in the context of Belle II's capabilities. Future collider data can more effectively distinguish between light NP and EFT regimes.

Abstract: Testing New-Physics (NP) scenarios that couple predominantly to the third
generation is notoriously difficult experimentally, as exemplified by comparing
limits for the $\tau$ lepton dipole moments to those of electron and muon. In
this case, extracting limits from processes such as $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$
often relies on effective-field-theory (EFT) arguments, which allows for
model-independent statements, but only applies if the NP scale is sufficiently
large compared to the center-of-mass energy. In this work we offer a
comprehensive analysis of light NP contributions to the $\tau$ dipole moments,
providing a detailed account of the interpretation of asymmetry measurements in
$e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ that are tailored towards the extraction of dipole
moments, for the test cases of new light spin-$0$ and spin-$1$ bosons.
Moreover, we study the decoupling to the EFT limit in these scenarios and
discuss the complementarity to constraints from other related processes, such
as production in $e^+e^-$ reactions. While covering a wide range of light NP
scenarios, as specific case study we present a detailed discussion of a
tauphilic gauge vector boson at Belle II.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Dirac leptogenesis mechanism using post-inflationary reheating, transferring asymmetry from scalar sector decays to baryons via Yukawa interactions and sphalerons, while naturally explaining small neutrino couplings and potentially detectable N_eff contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a viable leptogenesis mechanism compatible with small neutrino Yukawa couplings and observable effects in N_eff for testing with future cosmological data.

Method: Uses CP-violating inflaton decays during reheating to generate scalar sector asymmetry, transferred to chiral neutrinos via Yukawa interactions, then to baryons via electroweak sphalerons. Focuses on minimal model implementation.

Result: Demonstrates a mechanism naturally accommodating small neutrino couplings and predicting testable N_eff contributions through upcoming cosmological observations.

Conclusion: This Dirac leptogenesis approach offers a testable framework for baryogenesis, linking particle physics parameters to observable cosmological signatures like N_eff.

Abstract: We present a novel realization of Dirac leptogenesis based on the
post-inflationary reheating phase of the early universe. An asymmetry generated
within the scalar sector via CP-violating and out-of-equilibrium inflaton
decays is transferred to chiral neutrinos through Yukawa interactions and then
to baryons via electroweak sphalerons. We describe in detail a minimal
realization of this mechanism that naturally accommodates small neutrino Yukawa
couplings and results in contributions to the effective number of relativistic
species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, testable in upcoming cosmological observations.

Abstract: The observation of seeming hydrodynamic-like behavior in proton-proton and
proton-nucleus collisions presents us with the conceptual problem of how the
initial state of such a hydrodynamic evolution should be characterized. This is
an issue because, while nuclei can reasonably be approximated as ``large''
systems w.r.t. the characteristic Fermi momentum of their constituents, this is
no longer true for nucleons. Hence, one would need to match a ``quantum''
theory, whose observables are described via highly non-commuting operators, to
a ``classical'' hydrodynamics. Operationally assuming a ``fast''
thermalization, we survey what kind of object is best suited to such a matching
condition. We show that it cannot be any of the objects usually associated with
``the 3D structure of the nucleon'' but rather a measure associated with
entanglement entropy.

Abstract: In this paper, pair production of Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs bosons,
$hh$, is studied through $\gamma\gamma$ scattering at future electron-positron
colliders, in the framework of the Inert Doublet Model with two Active
Doublets, i.e., the I(1+2)HDM for short. The relevance of the process
$\gamma\gamma\to hh$ for such a Beyond the SM (BSM) scenario stems from the
fact that it is a one-loop process at lowest order, wherein inert charged
states $\chi^\pm$ contribute alongside with $W^\pm$, $H^\pm$ and heavy fermions
(primarily, bottom and top quarks), crucially, at the same perturbative order.
{{Given that $\chi^\pm/H^\pm$ masses and $hS^+S^-$ ($S^\pm=\chi^\pm, H^\pm$)
couplings are very mildly constrained,}} there exist regions of the parameter
space of the I(1+2)HDM where the former can be rather light and the latter
rather large. After imposing up-to-date theoretical and experimental
constraints on the I(1+2)HDM, it is found that the production rates of such
process at future $\gamma\gamma$ machines can be enhanced up to a factor of
$\approx$ $50$ with respect to the SM, significantly exceeding typical yields
of conventional 2-Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs). Further, thanks to the level of
control that one can attain at such facilities on the photon kinematics,
leading to excellent invariant mass resolution of the incoming photon pairs, we
show how it is possible to extract from this process the value of the
$\chi^\pm$ mass (along that of the active $H^\pm$ states) with high precision,
whichever the decays of the $hh$ pair, both with and without beam polarization.

TL;DR: Modular flavor symmetries impose strict constraints on observable combinations, making them resistant to quantum corrections even without supersymmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how modular invariance and holomorphicity in non-supersymmetric models can lead to observable combinations that are protected against quantum effects, which is significant for flavor physics and model building.

Method: The paper examines modular flavor symmetries in non-supersymmetric frameworks, analyzing the impact of modular invariance and holomorphicity on the quantum corrections of specific observable combinations.

Result: The study reveals that certain observable combinations remain highly constrained and immune to quantum corrections even in the absence of supersymmetry, contrary to expectations.

Conclusion: This unexpected resilience suggests a deeper underlying principle in modular symmetries, offering new avenues for constructing realistic flavor models without requiring supersymmetry.

Abstract: Theories of flavor operate at various scales. Recently it has been pointed
out that in the context of modular flavor symmetries certain combinations of
observables are highly constrained, or even uniquely fixed, by modular
invariance and holomorphicity. We find that even in the absence of
supersymmetry these combinations are surprisingly immune against quantum
corrections.

Abstract: Jet quenching is a phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions arising from jet
interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Its study is complicated by the
interplay of multiple physics processes that affect jet observables. In
addition, detector effects may influence the results and must be accounted for
when identifying quenched jets. We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network trained on jet substructure, incorporating parton shower
history, to predict jet-by-jet quenching levels. Using photon-jet samples from
the \textsc{Jewel} event generator, we show that the LSTM predictions strongly
correlate with true jet energy loss. This validates that the model effectively
learns the features of jet-QGP interaction. We simulate detector effects using
\textsc{Delphes} simulation framework and demonstrate that the method
identifies quenching effects in a realistic environment. We test the approach
with photon-jet momentum imbalance, jet fragmentation function, and jet shape,
which were not included in the training, confirming its ability to distinguish
true quenching features.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the strange double-charm pentaquark $P_{ccs}^{++}$ by calculating its strong decay widths and production branching ratios via $\Xi_{bc}^+$ decay. The total decay width is 84.58 MeV, and the predicted production branching ratio is $4.32\times10^{-6}$, indicating potential observability in experiments like LHCb.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the properties of the newly predicted $P_{ccs}^{++}$ pentaquark state, focusing on its stability (via decay width) and detectability (via production rates) to guide experimental searches.

Method: Three-point QCD sum rules for decay width calculations and a rescattering mechanism analysis for production branching ratios using $\Xi_{bc}^+$ decay processes.

Result: Calculated total strong decay width of $84.58^{+19.25}_{-18.80}$ MeV into $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ and $\Omega_{cc}\pi$ channels, and a production branching ratio of $(4.32_{-1.47}^{+2.02})\times10^{-6}$.

Conclusion: The narrow decay width and measurable production rate suggest the $P_{ccs}^{++}$ could be experimentally observed, particularly at LHCb.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the decay and production properties of the
strange double-charm pentaquark $P_{ccs}^{++}$ with strangeness $S=-1$.
Building upon our previous work predicting its $J^P=1/2^-$ molecular
configuration, we employ three-point QCD sum rules to calculate its strong
decay widths and estimate its production branching ratios via $\Xi_{bc}^+$
baryon decays. The total strong decay width into the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ and
$\Omega_{cc}\pi$ final-state channels is determined as
$84.58^{+19.25}_{-18.80}$ MeV. Furthermore, using a rescattering mechanism, we
analyze the $\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D_s^{\ast-}\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow
D^-P_{ccs}^{++}$ process and estimate the production branching ratio to be
$\mathcal{B}r(\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow
D^-P_{ccs}^{++})=(4.32_{-1.47}^{+2.02})\times10^{-6}$. The relatively narrow
width and detectable branching ratio suggest that this pentaquark state could
be observed in experiments such as LHCb.

TL;DR: The paper investigates thermal photon emission from a chiral quark-gluon plasma using Hard Thermal Loop approximation, finding enhanced emission due to chiral imbalance through additional terms involving quark and chiral chemical potentials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how chiral imbalance affects thermal photon production in high-energy QCD plasmas, which is crucial for interpreting signals of chirality in heavy-ion collisions.

Method: Used Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) approximation to analyze quasiparticle/plasmino dispersions under chiral imbalance, calculating photon emission rates via retarded self-energy components.

Result: Discovered chiral imbalance causes L/R-mode mass splitting and dispersion differences, leading to soft-photon emission enhancements proportional to squared chemical potentials.

Conclusion: Chiral chemical potential significantly impacts thermal photon spectra, offering observable signatures for detecting chiral symmetry restoration in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Abstract: We evaluate the thermal photon emission rate from a chirally asymmetric quark
gluon plasma using the Hard Thermal Loop approximation. The quasiparticle and
plasmino modes prevalent at finite temperature split into L and R-modes in the
presence of chiral imbalance and are found to disperse differently acquiring
different thermal masses. The soft contribution to the thermal photon emission
rate obtained from the retarded self-energy is found to contain additional
terms proportional to the square of the quark and chiral chemical potentials
which is found to cause an enhancement to thermal photon emission in the
presence of chiral imbalance.

TL;DR: Investigates predictive neutrino mass matrices with one texture zero and one vanishing sub-trace in the scotogenic model, analyzing twelve textures. Eleven predict TeV-scale dark matter with correlated bounds on |M_{ee}|, while some show weaker correlations or are excluded due to unrealistic parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore connections between neutrino masses, dark matter, and neutrinoless double beta decay in the scotogenic framework, identifying textures that link low-energy observables to high-scale parameters.

Method: Analyzes twelve viable texture structures (B_{1,4,5}, C_{1-5}, D_{4,5}, F_{5,6}) in the scotogenic model, parametrizing neutrino mass matrix entries in terms of |M_{ee}| and examining their implications for dark matter mass and neutrino observables.

Result: Eleven textures predict TeV-scale dark matter with testable bounds on |M_{ee}| for 0νββ experiments. Textures D4/F5-F6 show weaker correlations; C5 is excluded due to large Yukawa couplings and inability to sustain TeV dark matter.

Conclusion: Subset of predictive textures within the scotogenic model consistently relates dark matter phenomenology and 0νββ observables, highlighting testable predictions for future experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a predictive class of neutrino mass matrices
characterized by one texture zero and one vanishing sub-trace within the
framework of the scotogenic model, wherein neutrino masses, dark matter, and
neutrinoless double beta decay are intrinsically correlated. We analyze twelve
viable texture structures -- namely $B_{1,4,5}$, $C_{1,2,\ldots,5}$, $D_{4,5}$,
and $F_{5,6}$ -- and examine their implications for the effective Majorana mass
$(|M_{ee}|)$ governing neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$.
Remarkably, all non-zero entries of the neutrino mass matrix can be
parametrized in terms of this effective Majorana mass, establishing a direct
theoretical link between low-energy observables and high-scale parameters of
the model.Among the twelve textures, eleven predict dark matter masses of order
TeV and yield correlated bounds on $|M_{ee}|$ -- making them testable in
current and forthcoming $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments -- while the textures
$D_4$ and $F_{5,6}$ exhibit comparatively weaker correlations. In contrast, the
texture $C_5$ is excluded due to its requirement of unrealistically large
Yukawa couplings and its inability to realize dark matter in the TeV regime.
Our analysis thus identifies a subset of predictive neutrino mass textures that
consistently relate dark matter phenomenology and neutrinoless double beta
decay observables within the scotogenic paradigm.

### [42] [Reply to "Clearing up the Strong $CP$ problem"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04216)
*Wen-Yuan Ai,Björn Garbrecht,Carlos Tamarit*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper refutes a recent critique of CP conservation in QCD, addressing two main points: the quantum rotor analogy and the low-energy effective theory approach. It argues that the critique's assumptions about topological susceptibility and CP violation are flawed, affirming that CP remains a symmetry in QCD under the established frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address and counter the arguments presented in arXiv:2510.18951 which challenge the validity of prior works (arXiv:2001.07152 and arXiv:2403.00747) demonstrating CP conservation in QCD. The authors seek to defend the original findings by identifying critical flaws in the critique's reasoning.

Method: First, the paper uses the quantum rotor model as an analogy to QCD, demonstrating that the topological susceptibility does not vanish under the limiting procedure as claimed in the critique. This is shown by emphasizing the role of canonical commutation relations independent of disputed limits. Second, the paper critiques the low-energy effective theory approach proposed in the critique, arguing that it assumes non-general coupling choices that force CP violation, contrary to spurion analysis which allows CP-conserving configurations consistent with UV computations.

Result: The paper successfully refutes both arguments from arXiv:2510.18951. It shows the quantum rotor model does not invalidate CP conservation and demonstrates that the critique's low-energy approach is based on non-robust assumptions about couplings. This maintains the validity of original CP conservation claims.

Conclusion: CP conservation in QCD remains intact under the frameworks established in prior works. The critique's objections are shown to rely on flawed premises, reinforcing the conclusion that QCD does not inherently violate CP symmetry unless external factors beyond the Standard Model’s effective couplings are considered.

Abstract: The conservation of $CP$ in QCD has been shown to follow from a careful
treatment of the path integral and canonical quantization in arXiv:2001.07152
and arXiv:2403.00747. Here, we refute the critique of these results put forth
in arXiv:2510.18951. First, using the quantum rotor as an analogue of QCD, it
is argued in arXiv:2510.18951 that the topological susceptibility vanishes when
using the limiting procedure of arXiv:2001.07152. When translated to QCD, this
would contradict the observed $\eta^\prime$-mass. We show that this is not the
case because the susceptibility is defined from the vacuum correlator of the
topological charge density, which for the rotor is just fixed by the canonical
commutation relation. The latter does not depend on the disputed order of
limits. Second, it is suggested in arXiv:2510.18951 that $CP$ violation in QCD
can be established by considering the low-energy effective theory alone. We
show that here the argument relies on assuming from the start choices of
couplings that lead to $CP$ violation but are not of the most general form
allowed by spurion analysis. No valid reason is given for why allowed choices
leading to $CP$ conservation, that match the computation of ultraviolet
correlators as shown in arXiv:2001.07152 and arXiv:2403.00747, would be
inconsistent.

### [44] [Determination of quark-gluon-quark interference within the proton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04294)
*Alexey Vladimirov,Guillermo Portela,Simone Rodini*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: First direct determination of twist-three parton distribution functions from experimental data, revealing quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states and flavor-dependent correlations in the proton.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum effects beyond the naive parton picture, specifically quark-gluon-quark correlations, are not captured by ordinary parton densities. This work aims to quantify these effects through twist-three PDFs.

Method: Unified global fit combining collinear and transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems at leading-order QCD evolution for twist-three level analysis. Direct extraction from experimental data.

Result: Extracted distributions show statistically significant (2-3σ) non-zero values with flavor-dependent patterns, confirming quantum interference effects and non-trivial partonic correlations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the proton's genuinely quantum nature via measurable quark-gluon-quark correlations, opening new avenues for precision studies in quantum chromodynamics.

Abstract: Quarks and gluon, as quantum particles, are subjects to various effects that
go beyond the naive parton picture and are not captured by ordinary parton
densities. In this work, we investigate the twist-three parton distribution
functions, which encode quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states,
and for the first time, determine them directly from experimental data. The
analysis combines observables described by collinear and
transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems within a unified global
fit, incorporating a complete leading-order QCD evolution at the twist-three
level. The extracted distributions reveal a clear flavor-dependent patterns and
distinct from zero at a statistically significant level ($2-3\sigma$). These
findings provide the first quantitative evidence for quark-gluon-quark
correlations within the proton, revealing its genuinely quantum nature and
opening a new direction for precision studies of partonic correlations.

### [45] [Exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair with large invariant mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04315)
*Saad Nabeebaccus,David Perez,Lech Szymanowski,Samuel Wallon*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair in the reaction γN → N' M₁M₂ using collinear factorization, focusing on large invariant mass and small nucleon deflection. It automates cross-section calculations for GPD extraction at JLab 12 GeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new exclusive 2→3 reaction channels for extracting Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs) through the study of di-meson photoproduction in a specific kinematic regime.

Method: The authors use collinear factorization to separate the process into perturbative hard parts and non-perturbative GPDs/Distribution Amplitudes (DAs). They calculate the fully differential cross section at leading twist/order and automate this for JLab 12 GeV kinematics.

Result: Present numerical results from automated calculations, showing this method enables GPD extraction via experimental measurements of such exclusive processes.

Conclusion: Such di-meson photoproduction processes offer additional exclusive channels to complement existing methods for studying GPDs, enhancing our understanding of nucleon structure.

Abstract: We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair with large
invariant mass, $\gamma N \rightarrow N' M_1M_2$, in the framework of collinear
factorisation. The mesons considered $M_1$ and $M_2$ are either pions or rho
mesons, charged or neutral. We consider the kinematic regime characterised by a
large invariant mass of the two-meson system, and a small deflection of the
nucleon in the centre-of-mass frame. In this kinematic domain, the amplitude
factorises into a perturbative hard part and non-perturbative parts described
by Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs) and Distribution Amplitudes (DAs).
We automate the calculation of the fully differential cross section at leading
twist and leading order, and we present some numerical results at JLab 12 GeV
kinematics. This class of processes provides yet more exclusive $2 \to 3$
channels that can be used to extract GPDs.

### [46] [Emerging Narrow Resonance at 152 GeV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04335)
*Srimoy Bhattacharya,Mukesh Kumar,Rachid Mazini,Bruce Mellado*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents evidence for a new scalar resonance at 152 GeV observed in multi-lepton events at the LHC, potentially indicating physics beyond the Standard Model through its decay into lighter scalars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of the Higgs boson completed the Standard Model (SM), but the possibility of additional scalars exists. Anomalies in LHC multi-lepton events hint at beyond-SM physics, motivating the search for new scalar bosons.

Method: Analysis of combined LHC data from γγ, Zγ, and WW decay channels to identify a new scalar resonance via growing excesses with a mass of 152 ±1 GeV. A simplified model of a heavy scalar decaying into two lighter scalars is used to explain the anomalies.

Result: Observed combined global significance indicating the presence of a 152 GeV scalar resonance, aligning with the decay model and explaining multi-lepton excesses.

Conclusion: The findings advance the search for new scalar bosons at the electroweak scale. Future HL-LHC precision data is required to confirm the resonance's nature and potential extensions to the SM.

Abstract: The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC completed the Standard Model
(SM), yet the possibility of additional scalars remains open, provided their
contributions to electroweak symmetry breaking are sufficiently small. Recent
analyses of LHC data have revealed statistically significant anomalies in
multi-lepton final states - events characterized by multiple leptons, missing
transverse energy, and ($b$-)jets. These anomalies provide intriguing hints of
physics beyond the SM. In this work, we present the signature of growing
excesses for a new scalar resonance with a mass of \(152 \pm 1\) GeV, observed
in the \(\gamma\gamma\), \(Z\gamma\), and \(WW\) channels. The combined global
significance reaches a level that points toward the growing signature of this
resonance. The findings align with a simplified model in which a heavy scalar
boson decays into two lighter scalars, thus providing a consistent framework
explaining the observed multi-lepton anomalies.
  These results significantly advance the search for new scalar bosons at the
electroweak scale. Future investigations, including precision studies with
upcoming HL-LHC data, will be crucial for confirming the nature of this
resonance and exploring its implications for extending the SM.

### [47] [Diboson production in the SMEFT at dimension-8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04338)
*Hesham El Faham,Giuseppe Ventura,Eleni Vryonidou*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes dimension-8 and dimension-6 effects in fully leptonic WZ and WW production at the LHC using SMEFT, showing that dimension-8 effects remain significant unless new physics scales exceed 3 TeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of dimension-8 operators on diboson production measurements, evaluate their interplay with dimension-6 contributions, and ensure robustness of SMEFT analyses in the presence of higher-dimensional operators.

Method: Comprehensive SMEFT analysis of dimension-6 and -8 operators in quark-(anti)quark-initiated WW/WZ production. Used polarization-sensitive observables and LHC data to perform parameter fits, marginalizing over dimension-8 operators to test dimension-6 analysis robustness.

Result: Dimension-8 effects dominate over SM backgrounds below 3 TeV new-physics scales and significantly affect dimension-6 parameter extractions, showing that prior studies ignoring these effects may have underestimated uncertainties.

Conclusion: Dimension-8 contributions cannot be neglected in diboson production analyses at current/future LHC scales (<3 TeV). Marginalization over dimension-8 operators is essential for reliable dimension-6 SMEFT interpretation of data.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of dimension-8 and dimension-6 effects in
fully leptonic $WZ$ and $WW$ production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
within the Standard Model (SM) Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We focus on
dimension-8 operators with maximal energy growth in the
quark-(anti)quark-initiated production channel and assess their impact
differentially through a variety of observables, including
polarisation-sensitive ones. Leveraging existing data from measurements at the
LHC, we perform fits to quantify the sensitivity of current and future data to
dimension-8 effects and evaluate their interplay with squared dimension-6
contributions. By marginalising over the dimension-8 operators we examine the
robustness of a dimension-6 SMEFT analysis in diboson production. We find that
dimension-8 effects become subdominant only for new-physics scales above 3 TeV.

### [48] [Emergence of kaonium as a sharp resonance in photon-photon to meson-meson cross-sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04392)
*Alireza Beygi,S. P. Klevansky,R. H. Lemmer*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates the binding energies of kaonium (K+K−) using elastic scattering amplitudes and chiral perturbation theory, revealing it as a sharp resonance near 992 MeV. This resonance significantly improves fits to cross-section data for γγ → π⁰π⁰ and γγ → π⁰η, especially showing a 9:1 cross-section ratio in the latter. Direct detection is difficult due to kaonium's short lifetime (~10⁻¹⁸ s) and narrow width (~0.4 keV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the properties of kaonium (a hypothetical mesonic atom) and explain discrepancies in experimental cross-section data for photon-photon interactions, particularly the pronounced resonance peaks observed in γγ → π⁰η processes.

Method: The authors used the Kudryavtsev-Popov eigenvalue equation approach with K+K− elastic scattering amplitudes and applied chiral perturbation theory to model kaonium's behavior. They analyzed cross-section ratios to validate their findings against existing experiments.

Result: Kaonium is identified as a sharp resonance at ~992 MeV, closely linked to f₀(980) or a₀(980) mesons. The cross-section ratio σ(γγ → π⁰η)/σ(γγ → π⁰π⁰) reaches approximately 9 near the resonance. Including kaonium in calculations improves agreement with experimental data.

Conclusion: While direct detection remains challenging due to kaonium's short lifetime and narrow width, its theoretical inclusion enhances the accuracy of experimental data fitting, confirming its role in explaining observed photon-photon interaction resonances.

Abstract: We calculate the binding energies of the hypothetical mesonic atom, $K^+ K^-$
(kaonium), using the $K^+ K^- \to K^+ K^-$ elastic scattering amplitude. Our
findings are in line with previously reported results, which involve solving an
eigenvalue equation of the Kudryavtsev-Popov type. Using chiral perturbation
theory, we show that kaonium manifests itself as a sharp resonance around 992
MeV accompanying $f_0 (980)$ or $a_0 (980)$ in cross-sections for processes
$\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ or $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta$. The latter
process is particularly striking: the peak at the kaonium resonance energy is
highly pronounced, with the ratio of the cross-sections $\sigma (\gamma \gamma
\to \pi^0 \eta) / \sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0) \approx 9$. Due to the
short lifetime of kaonium ($\sim 10^{-18}$ s) and its small decay width ($\sim
0.4$ keV), direct detection of this exotic atom poses a significant challenge
and requires high experimental resolution. However, we show that once the
formation of kaonium is considered in the cross-section, a better fit to the
available experimental data is obtained.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate how the interference of the SM with ten four-light quark
operators in the SMEFT can be constrained thanks to multijet and $Z,W,\gamma$
VBF production in association with jets. The differential distributions for
each process are generated at LO for different jet multiplicities, that are
then merged and showered. We check which observables provide better bounds on
the Wilson coefficients, and what directions in the ten-dimensional coefficient
space they are able to probe. We discuss the relevance of the quadratic
contributions with respect to the linear terms.

### [50] [On the origin of CP symmetry violations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04536)
*Jean-Marcel Rax*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how Earth's gravitational field influences meson oscillations, leading to CP violation effects through coupling of flavor oscillations with quark zitterbewegung. This gravity-induced mixing predicts CP violation parameters matching experiments and suggests a mechanism for the universe's baryonic asymmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical origin of CP violation, which remains unexplained despite being accounted for via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. Existing interpretations don't address the fundamental cause, prompting investigation into gravitational effects as a potential source.

Method: Analyses the impact of Earth's gravity on meson oscillations, showing gravitational coupling links flavor oscillations with quark zitterbewegung (rapid quark motion). This interaction creates a superposition of CP eigenstates, producing three types of CP violation effects. Theoretical calculations predict violation parameters consistent with experimental measurements.

Result: Derives CP violation parameters aligned with experimental data, showing violation amplitude is linearly proportional to gravitational strength. This implies gravitational effects could influence cosmological processes.

Conclusion: Gravitational coupling provides a physical mechanism explaining CP violation's origin, offering a pathway to explain the universe's observed baryonic asymmetry through cosmological gravitational interactions.

Abstract: Experiments devoted to charge parity (CP) violation are normally interpreted
by adjusting the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix to the
measured violation parameters. However, the physical origin of these violations
remains an open issue. To resolve this issue, the impact of Earth's gravity on
meson oscillations is analysed. The effect of gravity is to couple flavour
oscillations to quark zitterbewegung oscillations, and this coupling induces a
superposition of CP eigenstates. The three types of CP violation effects result
from this gravity-induced mixing. The three associated violation parameters are
predicted in agreement with experimental data. The amplitude of the violation
is linear with respect to gravity, so this new mechanism allows us to envisage
cosmological evolutions that provide the observed baryonic asymmetry of the
universe.

### [51] [Probing quantum entanglement with Generalized Parton Distributions at the Electron-Ion Collider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04537)
*Yoshitaka Hatta,Jakob Schoenleber*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates spin density matrices for exclusively produced quark-antiquark pairs in Deep Inelastic Scattering using GPDs, revealing entanglement, Bell nonlocality, and non-stabilizerness. It predicts high polarization (50-80%) for massive quarks in Electron-Ion Collider runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the entanglement and quantum correlations in quark-antiquark pairs produced in Deep Inelastic Scattering, leveraging GPDs' complex amplitudes. The study aims to map kinematic regions exhibiting quantum phenomena and predict measurable polarization effects for massive quarks.

Method: Using collinear factorization with GPDs, the authors compute spin density matrices for various quark-antiquark pairs (uubar, ddbar, ssbar, ccbbar, bbarb). They analyze the real and imaginary parts of GPD amplitudes to assess entanglement, Bell violations, and non-stabilizerness. Polarization predictions use theoretical frameworks validated by hyperon polarization analogies.

Result: Entanglement, Bell nonlocality, and non-stabilizerness are observed in specific kinematic regions. Massive quarks (s, c, b) show significant transverse polarization (50-80%) in certain low-energy EIC conditions, analogous to hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions.

Conclusion: GPD-based analysis successfully uncovers quantum correlations in DIS-produced quark pairs, highlighting regions with measurable entanglement signatures. The predicted high polarization for strange/charm/beauty quarks offers clear experimental targets at the Electron-Ion Collider for probing QCD dynamics and quark-gluon correlations in nucleons.

Abstract: Within the collinear factorization framework based on Generalized Parton
Distributions (GPDs), we calculate the spin density matrix of exclusively
produced quark and antiquark pairs $u\bar{u}$, $d\bar{d}$, $s\bar{s}$,
$c\bar{c}$, $b\bar{b}$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering. The presence of both real
and imaginary parts in the GPD amplitudes leads to a rich pattern of
entanglement between the quark and the antiquark. We map out kinematical
regions where the pairs exhibit entanglement, Bell nonlocality and
non-stabilizerness (`magic'). We also predict that massive quarks and
antiquarks are transversely polarized, similar to the well-known transverse
hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions. In strangeness, charm and
bottom productions, the polarization can reach 50-80% in certain kinematic
regions in the low-energy runs of the Electron-Ion Collider.

### [52] [Flavour universality of the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ fermionic couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04587)
*Antonio Pich*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the lack of a dynamical explanation in the Standard Model for the existence of distinct fermion families, discussing empirical evidence supporting the universality of lepton and quark couplings through precise tests of W± and Z interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Standard Model's replication of the same gauge structure three times without explaining why different fermion families exist motivates the investigation into the universality of fermion couplings. The study aims to review experimental evidence supporting equal coupling strengths among families.

Method: The authors conduct an overview of empirical evidence and discuss the most precise experimental tests on lepton and quark coupling universality, covering both charged-current (W±) and neutral-current (Z) interactions.

Result: The analysis confirms the consistency of experimental data with the universality of lepton and quark couplings as predicted by the Standard Model, particularly in W± and Z interactions, though ongoing precision studies continue to test these parameters.

Conclusion: The observed universality of fermion couplings aligns with the Standard Model's assumption of three replicated families but leaves open questions about the dynamical origin of family replication, motivating further theoretical and experimental research.

Abstract: The Standard Model does not provide any dynamical explanation of the
existence of different families of fermions. To account for this experimental
fact, it just replicates three times its single-family gauge structure. The
equal-charge fermions of the different families couple to the gauge bosons with
exactly the same coupling strength. We overview the empirical evidence
supporting this important property. The currently most precise experimental
tests on the universality of the lepton and quark couplings are discussed. Both
charged-current ($W^\pm$) and neutral-current ($Z$) interactions are reviewed.

Abstract: Within a well-motivated 3-Higgs doublet model, in which the extended dark
