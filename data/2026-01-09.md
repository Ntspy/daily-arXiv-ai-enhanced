### [1] [A New Bayesian Framework with Natural Priors to Constrain the Neutron Star Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04294)
*Boyang Sun,Tianqi Zhao,James M. Lattimer*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework parameterizing mass-radius space for neutron star EOS inference, offering improved coverage, efficiency, and reduced prior dependency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address prior uncertainties and enhance the robustness and efficiency of neutron star EOS inference by moving from pressure-energy density to mass-radius parameterization.

Method: A new Bayesian framework using priors in mass-radius space with direct inversion approximations to map to EOS, compared against traditional parameterizations.

Result: The method provides broader coverage in mass-radius space, better for small radii, reduces computational load, and less dependent on prior assumptions.

Conclusion: Direct parameterization in observed space is a superior approach for neutron star EOS studies, reducing prior uncertainty influences and improving efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a new Bayesian framework to infer the neutron star equation of state (EOS) from mass and radius observations and neutron matter theory by defining priors that directly parameterize mass-radius space instead of pressure-energy density space. We use direct and accurate inversion approximations to map mass-radius relations to the underlying EOS. We systematically compare its EOS inferences with those inferred from traditional EOS parameterizations, taking care to quantify the systematic prior uncertainties of both. Our results show that prior uncertainties should be included in all Bayesian approaches. The more natural alternative framework provides broader coverage of the physically allowed mass-radius space, especially small radius configurations, and yields enhanced computational efficiency and substantially reduced dependence on prior choices. Our results demonstrate that direct parameterization in observed space offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

### [2] [Disk-to-Corona State Transition and Extreme X-ray Variability in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2019teq](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04311)
*Vera Berger,Erin Kara,Joheen Chakraborty,Megan Masterson,Kevin Burdge*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study analyzes the TDE AT2019teq's X-ray behavior over five years, revealing extreme variability, a transitioning from soft to hard X-ray states, and a long-lived corona. The observed sub-mHz QPOs and radio brightening suggest similarities to X-ray binaries but at higher luminosity and faster speeds. The derived black hole mass is lower than estimates from host galaxy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unusual X-ray properties and evolutionary path of AT2019teq, particularly its late hard X-ray emission and state transitions, which differ from typical TDEs and could provide insights into accretion physics and black hole mass estimation.

Method: X-ray spectral and timing analysis using multi-wavelength data. Techniques include MCMC-based red-noise simulations to interpret quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), X-ray spectral fitting to track state transitions, and comparing results with X-ray binary behavior. Multiple mass estimation methods (spectral and variability properties) were applied.

Result: AT2019teq shows an unprecedented soft-to-hard X-ray transition with late corona dominance. Significant sub-mHz QPOs detected. Radio emission correlates with the state change. Black hole mass estimates from X-ray methods are ~0.5 dex lower than host galaxy scaling predictions.

Conclusion: The unique evolution of AT2019teq links TDEs to X-ray binaries in accretion dynamics but operates at extreme scales. Discrepant mass estimates highlight potential issues with current galaxy-based scaling relations or emphasize the need for TDE-specific models in black hole mass determination.

Abstract: We present a five-year X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the optically selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT2019teq, which displays extreme variability, including order-of-magnitude changes in flux on minute-to-day timescales, and a rare late-time emergence of hard X-ray emission leading to the longest-lived corona in a known TDE. In one epoch, we detect sub-mHz quasi-periodic oscillations with significance tested via MCMC-based red-noise simulations (p $\leq 0.03$). AT2019teq exhibits a clear spectral evolution from a soft (blackbody-dominated) state to a hard (power-law-dominated) state, with a late-time radio brightening that may be associated with the state transition. We identify similarities between AT2019teq's evolution and X-ray binary soft-to-hard state transitions, albeit at higher luminosity and much faster timescales. We use the presence of both a disk-dominated and a corona-dominated state to apply multiple mass estimators from X-ray spectral and variability properties. These techniques are mutually consistent within $2σ$ and systematically yield a lower black hole mass ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 5.67 \pm 0.09$) than inferred from host galaxy scaling ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=6.14 \pm 0.19$).

### [3] [Simulating the Formation of the Young "Fermi Bubbles" in the Circinus Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04317)
*Shaokun Xie,Fulai Guo,Ruiyu Zhang,B. Mingo,Fangzheng Shi,Jiang-Tao Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses hydrodynamic simulations to show that AGN jets, not winds or starburst activity, form the Circinus galaxy's bubbles, similar to the Fermi bubbles in the Milky Way, highlighting AGN jets as a key driver of galactic feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve debates on the origin of Fermi and eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way by studying analogous structures in the Circinus galaxy through simulations.

Method: Hydrodynamic simulations of AGN jets and winds in the Circinus galaxy, comparing simulated bubble characteristics, X-ray emissions, and hotspot regions with observational data.

Result: Simulations show AGN jets form bubble morphology matching observations, with non-thermal emissions contributing to radio/X-ray signals. AGN winds produce inconsistent spherical bubbles. Hotspots and axis misalignment rule out starburst winds.

Conclusion: AGN jet-driven shocks are the primary mechanism for galactic bubbles, suggesting widespread relevance in disk galaxies' evolution via AGN feedback.

Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way represent an archetypal case of galactic nucleus feedback, yet their origin remains highly debated. Here we use hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of the "Fermi bubbles" in the nearby Circinus galaxy, a pair of kpc-scaled elliptical bubbles seen in both radio and X-ray observations. We find that a pair of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets drive forward shocks in the circumgalactic medium, and after evolving for ~0.95 Myr, the shock-delineated bubble pair roughly matches the observed Circinus bubbles in size and morphology. Our mock X-ray image and spectrum reproduce the observed edge-brightened X-ray surface brightness distribution and spectrum quite well, and suggest that non-thermal emissions from the jet ejecta also contribute substantially to radio and X-ray emissions from the inner "hotspot" region. We further show that AGN winds tend to produce more spherical bubbles with a wider base near the galactic plane, inconsistent with observations. The hotspot emissions and the misalignment between the galaxy rotational axis and the bubble's axis argue against a starburst wind origin. Our study thus corroborates the AGN jet-shock model for the origin of both the Circinus bubbles and the Fermi bubbles, and suggests that AGN jet feedback may be a common origin of extended gaseous bubbles in regular disk galaxies, potentially playing an important role in their evolution.

### [4] [Formation of Recycled Pulsars in Common Envelope Binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04355)
*Yu-Dong Nie,Yong Shao,Jian-Guo He,Ze-Lin Wei,Shi-Jie Gao,Xiao-Jie Xu,Xiang-Dong Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines the evolution of L/IMXBs with neutron stars and varying donor masses using MESA simulations, showing dynamically unstable mass transfer leading to common envelope phases. It finds that efficient CE ejection (α_CE=3.0) aligns with observed NS-WD binaries and identifies pathways for forming millisecond pulsars like PSR J1928+1815 through CE decoupling and mass transfer phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolutionary paths of low/intermediate-mass X-ray binaries, particularly how common envelope phases and CE ejection efficiencies influence the formation of recycled pulsars and their companion properties compared to observations.

Method: Simulations using MESA to model binary systems with 1.4 solar mass neutron stars and donors from 1-8 solar masses. Parameters include CE ejection efficiencies (α_CE 0.3-3.0) to track post-CE outcomes and mass transfer phases (CEDP, Case BA/BB/BC) leading to millisecond pulsar formation.

Result: Donors >3.5 solar masses evolve into NS-C/O or O/Ne WD binaries (0.5-1.4 solar masses WDs). Higher α_CE=3.0 best matches observed pulsar-WD systems. NSs accrete enough mass during CEDP phases to become millisecond pulsars, with two channels reproducing PSR J1928+1815's characteristics.

Conclusion: CE decoupling phases are critical in shaping binary outcomes and pulsar recycling. Optimal CE ejection efficiency (α_CE≈3) bridges simulated and observed systems, providing constraints for binary evolution models.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (L/IMXBs) consisting of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star (NS) and a donor star of mass $1-8\,M_{\odot}$. Using grids of detailed MESA simulations, we show that for donor masses of $2-8\,M_{\odot}$, mass transfer may be dynamically unstable, leading to a common envelope (CE) phase. By adopting CE ejection efficiencies in the range $α_{\rm CE} = 0.3-3.0$, we find that post-CE binaries frequently experience a CE decoupling phase (CEDP), which plays a critical role in determining their final orbital and compositional properties. Systems with initial donor masses $\gtrsim 3.5\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly evolve into NS binaries with carbon-oxygen or oxygen-neon white dwarfs (WDs) with masses between $0.5\,M_{\odot}$ and $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. Comparison with the observed population of binary pulsars with a WD companion shows better agreement with higher CE ejection efficiencies ($α_{\rm CE} = 3.0$). Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSs can accrete a sufficient amount of matter ($\gtrsim 0.01\,M_{\odot}$) during the CEDP and subsequent Case BA/BB/BC mass transfer phases to be effectively recycled into millisecond pulsars. We identify two distinct evolutionary channels capable of reproducing the observed characteristics of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1928+1815 with a helium-star companion. Our results highlight the importance of the CEDP in the formation of recycled pulsars and provide constraints on the CE ejection efficiency during binary evolution.

### [5] [Can tidal disruption event models reliably measure black hole masses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04406)
*C. R. Angus,A. J. Smith,D. Magill,P. Ramsden,N. Sarin,M. Nicholl,B. Mockler,E. Hammerstein,R. Stein,Y. Yao,T. de Boer,K. C. Chambers,M. E. Huber,C. -C. Lin,T. B. Lowe,E. A. Magnier,S. J. Smartt,R. J. Wainscoat*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper tests the reliability of tidal disruption event (TDE) models using three repeating partial TDEs, finding consistent black hole mass estimates between flares and host-galaxy proxies, but highlighting limitations in existing models and the need for better near-UV light curve data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the robustness of current TDE models which assume full disruptions, despite expectations that partial disruptions dominate, and ensure accurate mass estimates for black holes using TDE data, especially for upcoming large surveys.

Method: Analyzing three spectroscopically confirmed repeating partial TDEs (AT 2020vdq, 2022dbl, 2023adr) by independently modeling their flares with multiple methods (fallback-accretion, stream-stream collisions, empirical luminosity relations, cooling-envelope fits) and comparing derived black hole masses with host-galaxy proxies.

Result: All models generally produce consistent black hole mass estimates between flares and comparable to host-galaxy proxies within 0.3-0.5 dex, but fallback models show issues with unphysical stellar parameters. Improved near-UV light curve coverage is critical for accurate constraints.

Conclusion: Current TDE models can reliably estimate black hole masses in partial disruptions but require improved model grids and observational strategies (prioritizing near-UV data) to avoid systematic errors, especially for future large-scale surveys.

Abstract: Tidal disruption event (TDE) light curves are increasingly used to infer the masses of quiescent supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm{BH}}$), offering a powerful probe of low-mass black hole demographics independent of host-galaxy scaling relations. However, the reliability of most semi-analytic TDE models assume full stellar disruption, despite theoretical expectations that partial disruptions dominate the TDE population. In this work we test the robustness of current TDE models using three repeating partial TDEs (rpTDEs), in which the multiple flares produced by the same surviving stellar core must yield consistent black hole masses. We present spectroscopic observations establishing AT 2023adr as a rpTDE, making it the third such spectroscopically confirmed event. We independently model the flares of the three rpTDEs; 2020vdq, 2022dbl, and 2023adr, applying fallback-accretion fits, stream-stream collision scaling relations, luminosity-based empirical relations, and cooling-envelope fits. After accounting for statistical and model-specific systematics, we find that all TDE models generally return self-consistent $M_{\rm{BH}}$ values between flares, and are broadly consistent with host-galaxy $M_{\rm{BH}}$ proxies, recovering $M_{\rm{BH}}$ to within 0.3-0.5 dex. However, the convergence of fallback models towards unphysical stellar masses and impact parameters reveals limitations in the existing fallback model grids. We also show that light curve coverage, particularly in the near-UV, is critical for constraining model parameters. This has direct implications for interpreting the thousands of TDE light curves expected from upcoming surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where from simulations, we find that $M_{\rm{BH}}$ may be underestimated on average by 0.5 dex without additional follow-up.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper discusses how nuclear yields from supernovae can act as probes for understanding supernova engines and dense matter physics, highlighting the need to reduce uncertainties through improved nuclear physics data and astrophysical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize nuclear yields as direct probes of supernova engines and dense-matter physics, while addressing uncertainties in both nuclear physics and astrophysical models. The rise of advanced gamma-ray detectors necessitates minimizing these uncertainties to fully leverage these probes.

Method: Review of current nuclear physics and astrophysical uncertainties affecting nucleosynthetic yields. Emphasis on combining lab experiments and nuclear theory to reduce nuclear uncertainties, and developing higher-fidelity stellar evolution and supernova models to address astrophysical uncertainties.

Result: Identifies key areas of study needed to maximize the potential of supernova yields as informative probes, stressing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between nuclear physicists and astrophysicists.

Conclusion: Future advancements in both nuclear physics experiments, theoretical models, and more detailed supernova simulations are critical to unlocking the full diagnostic power of nuclear yields in studying astrophysical transients and fundamental physics like dense matter and neutrino interactions.

Abstract: Nuclear yields are powerful probes of supernova explosions, their engines and their progenitors. In addition, as we improve our understanding of these explosions, we can use nuclear yields to probe dense matter and neutrino physics, both of which play a critical role in the central supernova engine. Especially with upcoming gamma-ray detectors that can directly detect radioactive isotopes out to increasing distances from gamma-rays emitted during their decay, nuclear yields have the potential to provide some of the most direct probes of supernova engines and stellar burning. To utilize these probes, we must understand and limit the uncertainties in their production. Uncertainties in the nuclear physics can be minimized by combining both laboratory experiments and nuclear theory. Similarly, astrophysical uncertainties caused by simplified explosion trajectories can be minimized by higher-fidelity stellar-evolution and supernova-engine models. This paper reviews the physics and astrophysics uncertainties in modeling nucleosynthetic yields, identifying the key areas of study needed to maximize the potential of supernova yields as probes of astrophysical transients and dense-matter physics.

### [7] [Identifying the poynting-flux-dominated outflow of Fermi GRBs with non-thermal spectrum and its energy-resolved light curve fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04468)
*Xue-Zhao Chang,HouJun Lü,Zhao-Wei Du,Xing Yang,En-Wei Liang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes 129 pulses from 88 GRBs to determine jet compositions, finding that high magnetization in some bursts supports Poynting-flux dominated outflows. Spectral classifications and pulse width-energy correlations provide evidence for non-thermal processes and magnetic energy dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand GRB energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms by investigating jet compositions, specifically addressing the role of magnetization and outflow origins through spectral analysis and light curve modeling.

Method: Analyzed 129 pulses from Fermi/GBF-detected GRBs with measured redshifts. Spectra were fit using Band, CPL, BB, NDP, Band+BB, and CPL+BB models. For non-thermal spectra, magnetization lower limits were calculated. Light curve fits with FRED model checked for correlations between pulse width and energy.

Result: 80 pulses showed purely non-thermal spectra (30 in 21 GRBs had σ >5 at photosphere), 35 hybrid, and 14 thermal spectra. A correlation between pulse width and energy in 13 GRBs with high σ supports Poynting-flux outflows.

Conclusion: High magnetization GRB outflows are likely Poynting-flux dominated. Spectral and timing analyses provide independent evidence reinforcing the need for magnetic energy in jet dynamics.

Abstract: The jet compositions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are very important to understand the energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms, but it remains an open question in GRB physics. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively. By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($σ$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $σ>5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $σ$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $σ$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow.

*Shrabani Kumar,G. C. Dewangan,K. P. Singh,P. Gandhi,L. Mallick,G. C. Stewart,S. Bhattacharyya,S. Chandra*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes the UV/X-ray spectra of four Seyfert 1 galaxies using AstroSat data, revealing insights into accretion disk structures, varying corona sizes, and potential state transitions in active galactic nuclei.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the accretion processes and coronal structures in Seyfert galaxies through joint UV/X-ray spectral analysis, particularly focusing on Eddington ratios and corona dynamics.

Method: Used UV and X-ray data from AstroSat's telescopes with OPTXAGNF and FAGNSED models to model the accretion disk and Comptonization by warm/hot coronae. Analyzed spectral variations linked to corona size and disk parameters.

Result: Found compact warm coronae (<18 rg) in SWIFT J1835.0+3240 vs larger sizes (>32 rg) in others. Determined spin parameter (a*=0.76) for PG 0804+761. Observations suggest a possible state transition in SWIFT J1835.0+3240 from high/soft to low/hard state due to disk cooling and reduced accretion.

Conclusion: Variability in corona sizes and spectral states correlates with accretion rate and disk temperature. The study advances understanding of active galactic nuclei behavior across different accretion states.

Abstract: We present the UV/X-ray joint spectral analyses of four Seyfert~1 galaxies (PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, SWIFT J1921.1-5842, and SWIFT J1835.0+3240) using the data acquired with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and Soft X-ray Telescope onboard AstroSat. We model the intrinsic UV/X-ray continuum with the accretion disk, warm and hot Comptonization using the OPTXAGNF and FAGNSED models, where the disk seed photons are Comptonized in the warm and hot corona. The Eddington ratio of the four Seyferts ranges from 0.01 to 1. In the case of SWIFT J1835.0$+$3240, we infer a compact warm corona ($ R_{warm} - R_{hot} \lesssim 18 r_{g}$) while, PG 0804+761, NGC 7469, and SWIFT J1921.1-5842 may exhibit a larger warm Comptonizing region ($\gtrsim 32r_{g}$). We could constrain the spin parameter in PG 0804+761, $a^{\star} = 0.76_{-0.20}^{+0.08}$ (1$σ$ error), with the FAGNSED model. In SWIFT J1835.0+3240 and SWIFT J1921.1-5842, the UV/X-ray spectral variability may be driven by the thermal Comptonization of the disk seed photons in the hot corona. Furthermore, the observed spectral hardening with the decrease in disk temperature and accretion rate compared to earlier observations may indicate a state transition in SWIFT J1835.0+3240 from a high/soft to a low/hard state.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of Abell 3571 using EP-FXT data reveals ongoing dynamical activity post a minor merger, despite its relaxed X-ray appearance, showing sloshing motions and asymmetries in temperature/entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamical state of Abell 3571, a nearby X-ray bright cluster in the Shapley Supercluster, by extending measurements beyond its R500 radius and exploring post-merger signatures.

Method: Wide-field X-ray observations with EP-FXT covering 1×1 degrees, analyzing surface brightness, temperature, pressure, and entropy profiles to detect merger-related features like sloshing motions.

Result: Detected surface-brightness excesses in northern/southern regions with temperature/entropy asymmetries, no cold fronts/shocks, consistent with sloshing from an off-center minor merger, indicating a post-merger phase.

Conclusion: A3571 is dynamically active post-minor merger, showcasing EP-FXT's efficacy in studying cluster outskirts. The cluster's symmetric appearance masks ongoing recovery from past mergers.

Abstract: Abell 3571 is a nearby, X-ray bright galaxy cluster located in the Shapley Supercluster. Although it appears morphologically relaxed in X-ray images, multiwavelength observations reveal subtle indications of residual dynamical activity, likely associated with past merger events. Using wide-field ($1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$) data from the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT), we extend measurements of the cluster's properties beyond its $R_{500}$ radius. We detect surface-brightness excesses on both the northern and southern sides, consistent with previous XMM-Newton results. The temperature, pressure, and entropy in the northern excess region are lower than the average values, whereas those on the southern side are slightly higher. However, we find no evidence for cold fronts or shocks. These features can be interpreted as sloshing motions triggered by an off-center minor merger. Our findings suggest that, despite its symmetric appearance, A3571 is still recovering from a minor merger and is currently in a post-merger phase. This work also demonstrates the excellent capability of EP-FXT for probing the outskirts of galaxy clusters.

### [10] [Long-term evolution of cyclotron resonant scattering features in the accreting pulsar Vela X-1: A pulse-to-pulse approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04851)
*Yu-Jia Du,Peng-Ju Wang,Lorenzo Ducci,Long Ji,Ling-Da Kong,Qing-Cui Bu,Chirag Mehrotra,Andrea Santangelo*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents long-term observations of Vela X-1 showing that the decay of cyclotron line energy (E_cyc,H) has ceased, with a transient increase between 2020-2023 indicating magnetic/accretion changes. E_cyc,H correlates weakly with luminosity, while the fundamental line (E_cyc,F) remains stable at 25 keV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the long-term evolution of cyclotron line energies and their relationship with luminosity in Vela X-1, addressing gaps in understanding magnetic field and accretion dynamics in high-mass X-ray binaries.

Method: Analysis of 2005-2024 Swift/BAT archival data and 2012-2024 NuSTAR pulse-to-pulse observations, focusing on cyclotron line energy measurements and luminosity correlations.

Result: E_cyc,H decay has halted; a 2020-2023 transient increase in E_cyc,H detected; E_cyc,H shows luminosity dependence (lower at low luminosities, flattens above ~1.21e37 erg/s); E_cyc,F remains stable at 25 keV.

Conclusion: Magnetic field and accretion geometry likely underwent sudden changes in 2020-2023. The observed trends support models where E_cyc,H reflects instantaneous accretion conditions, while the stable E_cyc,F suggests a more fundamental neutron star property.

Abstract: We investigated the long-term evolution of the cyclotron line energy, as well as the relationship between cyclotron line energy and luminosity in the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1, based on archival Swift/BAT monitoring from 2005 to 2024 and pulse-to-pulse analysis of nine NuSTAR observations from 2012 to 2024. Our results provide the first confirmation that the long-term decay of the harmonic line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,H}$) in Vela X-1 has ended. We further report the first detection of a transient increase in $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ between 2020 and 2023, which suggests a sudden and significant change in the magnetic field configuration or accretion geometry. In addition, $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ shows slightly lower values at low luminosities and tends to flatten at higher luminosities, in the range of $(0.13\text{--}1.21) \times10^{37} $erg $\rm{s}^{-1}$. The fundamental line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,F}$) exhibits no significant variation with time or luminosity, remaining stable at approximately 25 keV.

*Aryabrat Mahapatra,Adarsh Pandey,Pritam Banerjee,Tapobrata Sarkar*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates how a spinning intermediate-mass black hole affects interactions with a close white dwarf binary, showing that black hole spin significantly influences tidal dynamics and mass fallback rates, which depend strongly on the initial inclination angles of the binary's spin and orbital angular momentum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of a spinning black hole on stellar binary encounters, particularly focusing on tidal interactions and how the black hole's spin interacts with the binary's angular momentum configurations.

Method: Three-body problem analysis using point particle approximation, followed by SPH simulations. Geodesic equations for the spinning black hole were integrated, while Newtonian gravity handled hydrodynamics and star interactions. Parameters included equatorial/off-equatorial orbits and varying initial inclinations between binary spin and orbital angular momentum.

Result: Black hole spin clearly affects tidal dynamics. Observables like mass fallback rates show strong dependence on initial inclination angles. For certain configurations, the Hills mechanism produces a three-hump fallback rate structure from tidal debris interactions.

Conclusion: Black hole spin influences tidal interactions in distinct ways depending on binary's initial alignment. The study highlights the necessity of considering spin and inclination in modeling relativistic astrophysical phenomena involving close encounters.

Abstract: When a stellar binary encounters a spinning black hole, interesting phenomena might result due to the mutual interaction between the binary spin, orbital angular momentum and the black hole spin. Here we consider such encounters between an intermediate mass spinning black hole and a close identical white dwarf binary system whose center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory. After studying a corresponding three-body problem in the point particle approximation, we perform a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics based numerical simulations of such scenarios. For this, we integrate the geodesic equations for the spinning black hole, while considering the hydrodynamics and the self and mutual gravitational interactions of the stars in a Newtonian approximation, an approach justified by the choice of parameters in the theory. We consider various initial configurations of the binary center of mass leading to equatorial and off-equatorial orbits, as also various initial inclinations between the binary's initial spin angular momentum and its initial orbital angular momentum. We find that the effects of black hole spin manifest clearly in the tidal dynamics of the binary components, while the observables of tidal encounters such as mass fallback rates are strongly dependent on the initial inclination angle. We show that the influence of the black hole spin emerges in distinct ways for different initial configurations of the binary's spin alignment. We establish that within the ambits of the Hills mechanism, in certain cases, the fallback rate may show a three-hump structure, due to interactions between tidal debris of the individual stars.

TL;DR: This paper presents a first study of the time-varying spectro-polarimetric properties of the millisecond pulsar J2144-5237, revealing orbital-phase-dependent spectral and polarization behaviors, and demonstrating the potential of such analyses for understanding pulsar emission mechanisms and magnetospheric processes.

Motivation: To explore uncharted temporal variations in pulsar spectro-polarimetry, which can uncover emission mechanisms, magnetic field geometry, and propagation effects in pulsar magnetospheres.

Method: Developed a package to analyze time-varying spectral behavior of full Stokes parameters, applied to MSP J2144-5237 using Parkes UWL receiver data, measuring RM variations and tracking Poincaré sphere polarization changes.

Result: Observed correlated spectral variations in Stokes I/Q/V across orbital phases, Stokes U showing both correlation/anticorrelation with I depending on phase, and systematic Poincaré sphere trajectory shifts for the main component with orbital phase.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of temporal spectro-polarimetry in pulsar studies, advocating for扩展 these analyses to a broader pulsar sample to advance understanding of magnetospheric physics and binary interactions.

Abstract: While the temporal variations of the spectro-polarimetric nature of pulsars remains unexplored, this investigation offers significant potential for uncovering key insights into pulsar emission mechanisms, magnetic field geometry, and propagation effects within the magnetosphere. We developed a package for investigating time-varying spectral behavior for full Stokes parameters and demonstrate it on a millisecond pulsar (MSP) J2144-5237 in a binary system (orbital period ~10 days) using the Parkes UWL receiver. In this study we report rotation measure (RM) variation with orbital phase. We find that the temporal variations in the spectra of Stokes I, Q, and V are generally correlated throughout the orbit, while Stokes U exhibits intervals of both correlation and anticorrelation with Stokes I, depending on the orbital phase. We also provide a Poincare sphere representation of the polarization properties of J2144-5237, demonstrating a systematic temporal change of Poincare sphere location for the main component with orbital phase. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of time-varying properties of the spectro-polarimetric nature of any pulsars or MSPs. Extending this study to probe the spectro-temporal nature of full Stokes data on a larger sample of MSPs or pulsars has the potential to provide vital information on emission mechanisms inside the magnetosphere, interstellar propagation effects, and binary interactions.

### [13] [Triaxial Magnetars as Sources of Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04953)
*J. I. Katz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes that the enigmatic temporal behaviors of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) could arise from dynamically triaxial magnetars, where FRB repeaters and non-repeaters are distinguished based on the alignment of their rotation axes and open magnetic field lines with the observer's line of sight. Slight triaxiality in magnetars causes periodic or aperiodic variations in FRB activity, while significant triaxiality drastically reduces detectability, potentially explaining non-repeating FRBs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the varied temporal characteristics of FRBs, such as repetition rates and activity fluctuations, which remain unaccounted for by existing models. The dynamic triaxiality of magnetars provides a plausible mechanism for these observations without requiring distinct progenitor populations for repeaters and non-repeaters.

Method: Theoretical analysis of magnetar dynamics and radiation patterns. The study examines how a triaxial moment of inertia tensor affects the orientation of open magnetic field lines and emission regions relative to Earth, leading to observable FRB activity fluctuations. It also considers the implications for gravitational wave detection.

Result: The model demonstrates that slight triaxiality in magnetars can cause aperiodic variations in emission visibility (explaining active/inactive phases of repeaters), while highly triaxial systems result in extreme broadening of the radiation pattern's duty cycle, making bursts rare or unrepeatable. Additionally, triaxial dynamics complicate gravitational wave signal integration from fast-rotating neutron stars.

Conclusion: FRB temporal diversity likely stems from magnetar triaxiality's geometric effects, unifying repeaters/non-repeaters within a single framework. Future observations tracking FRB activity variability provide tests for this model. Gravitational wave studies of neutron stars must account for triaxiality-induced signal distortion.

Abstract: I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars. If the bursts are narrowly collimated along open field lines, then observed repeating FRB may be those in which the moment of inertia tensor is only slightly triaxial and the rotation axis, open field lines and radiation point nearly to the observer. Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst vary aperiodically. The dynamics of triaxial bodies may also thwart the coherent integration of gravitational signals from fast-rotating accreting neutron stars.

### [14] [Probing millisecond magnetar formation in binary neutron star mergers through X-ray follow-up of gravitational wave alerts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04990)
*Clara Plasse,Alexis Reboul-Salze,Jérome Guilet,Diego Götz,Nicolas Leroy,Raphaël. Raynaud,Matteo Bugli,Tito Dal Canton*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the viability of detecting neutron star remnants from binary neutron star mergers through joint gravitational wave and X-ray observations, estimating detection rates with current and future instruments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The remnant nature of BNS mergers is uncertain, with X-ray observations suggesting a neutron star could be the engine of GRBs. Joint GW-X-ray observations can constrain this.

Method: Simulated GW signals and X-ray emission from magnetar-powered ejecta. Used numerical codes modeling spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical relativity.

Result: 2-16% of BNS mergers form magnetars; up to 70% detectable with current instruments (1/yr during LVKI O5), increasing to 3 orders of magnitude with next-gen GW detectors. Optimal detection times around 2-4 hours post-merger.

Conclusion: Detecting magnetar spin-down emission is feasible now and enhanced future, crucial for understanding BNS merger outcomes and NS physics.

Abstract: The nature of the remnant of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is uncertain. Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies. Although more likely with upcoming GW interferometers, detecting the spin-down emission of a millisecond magnetar may already be within reach, warranting sustained theoretical and observational efforts given the profound implications for mergers, GRBs, and NS physics of a single detection.

### [15] [Jet launching from the Kerr black hole magnetosphere: An electrogeodesic approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05048)
*Jibril Ben Achour,Ileyk El Mellah,Eric Gourgoulhon*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents an analytical model for relativistic jet launch from Kerr black hole magnetospheres using charged particle trajectories, leveraging the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in Kerr monopole fields. Key results include a stability criterion for polar jets, quantification of frame-dragging effects, and a blueshift condition for observed particles. The model identifies specific magnetization and spin-dependent regions where particle acceleration occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRMHD/GRPIC simulations reproduce relativistic jets but lack simple analytical models explaining particle dynamics. Analytical approaches are needed to understand how individual charged particles form jets and emit radiation.

Method: The authors use conservation laws and separability of electrogeodesic equations in Kerr geometry's monopole magnetosphere. By solving integrable particle motion equations, they derive analytical conditions for jet stability, frame-dragging effects, and blueshift observations. They also review magnetosphere construction using Kerr's hidden symmetries.

Result: 1. Polar axis stability criterion for jet formation
2. Frame-dragging effect expression
3. Blueshift condition for distant observers
4. Acceleration region determined by black hole spin/magnetization
5. Foundiation for future analytical jet models via symmetry-based magnetospheres

Conclusion: Analytical models using Kerr geometry symmetries can successfully describe jet launches at fundamental level. The model highlights critical parameters (spin, magnetization) controlling particle acceleration regions. Future work should extend to more complex magnetospheres and test predictions against simulation data.

Abstract: The launch of relativistic jets of plasma on astrophysical to cosmological scales are observed in a variety of astrophysical sources, from active galactic nuclei to X-rays binaries. While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work.

*Itamar Giron,Menahem Krief,Nicholas C. Stone,Elad Steinberg*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper extends the RICH radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) code to multigroup flux-limited diffusion (FLD), enhancing its applicability to high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Validation tests and a pilot study of a tidal disruption event (TDE) with an intermediate-mass black hole show promising results, including a predicted X-ray flash before the optical peak.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of grey FLD in accurately modeling complex radiation processes in astrophysical systems with extreme dynamic ranges and strong radiation forces.

Method: Extended RICH code to multigroup FLD, implemented on an unstructured moving mesh with a convergence acceleration scheme for optically thick cells. Validated via analytic benchmarks (including a new Doppler term test) and applied to an IMBH TDE scenario.

Result: Successful validation against benchmarks and initial TDE simulations producing an X-ray flash consistent with observations and prior post-processed models.

Conclusion: Multigroup RICH enables more realistic modeling of systems with multiwavelength emission and radiation dynamics, emphasizing its utility for phenomena like TDEs involving extreme conditions.

Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge astronomy's perception as distant or luxurious by showing its practical benefits for communities and align the field with socio-economic development goals.

Method: Case studies from South Africa, Chile, Indonesia, and India analyzing impacts of astronomical initiatives on education, economy, and local enterprises. The study also identifies challenges and proposes a framework based on participatory engagement and UN SDGs.

Result: Demonstrates astronomy's potential through examples of local economic stimulation, job creation, and STEM engagement but highlights issues like unequal benefits and sustainability after external funding ceases. A framework is proposed for effective, inclusive initiatives.

Conclusion: Investment in astronomy can yield tangible local benefits when designed with participatory approaches and SDG alignment. The proposed guidelines aim to enhance accessibility and sustainability of such initiatives worldwide.

Abstract: Astronomy, often perceived as a distant or luxury science, holds immense potential as a driver for sustainable local socio-economic development. This paper explores how astronomy can create tangible benefits for communities through education, tourism, technology transfer, and capacity building. Using case studies from South Africa, Chile, Indonesia, and India, we demonstrate how astronomical facilities and initiatives have stimulated local economies, generated employment, supported small enterprises, and enhanced STEM participation, while simultaneously inspiring a sense of shared global heritage. The analysis identifies both successes and challenges, including unequal benefit distribution, limited local ownership, and sustainability gaps once external funding ends. Building on these lessons, we propose a practical framework/guidelines for designing, implementing, and evaluating astronomy-based community initiatives, rooted in participatory engagement and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper positions astronomy as a catalyst for inclusive growth, demonstrating that investment in the cosmos can translate into grounded, measurable benefits for people and places on Earth.

### [18] [Exploring Metal Additive Manufacturing in Martian Atmospheric Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04232)
*Zane Mebruer,Wan Shou*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This study explores using CO2 from the Martian atmosphere as a substitute for argon in selective laser melting (SLM) to enable sustainable in-space manufacturing, showing CO2 can produce viable parts despite some drawbacks compared to argon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the logistical challenges of transporting materials to Mars and the impracticality of using argon in SLM, which requires costly inert environments unattainable on Mars.

Method: Fabricated 316L stainless steel specimens using SLM under argon, CO2, and ambient air conditions with varied laser parameters, analyzing surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation.

Result: CO2-produced parts had slightly lower quality than argon but were far better than ambient air. Balanced laser parameters maintained thermal equilibrium for acceptable results.

Conclusion: CO2-based SLM is feasible for Martian manufacturing and offers terrestrial cost-saving potential as an alternative shielding gas.

Abstract: In-space manufacturing is essential for achieving long-term planetary colonization, particularly on Mars, where material transport from Earth is both costly and logistically restrictive. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications.

*Munazza K. Alam,Leonardo Ubeda,Qinyan,Lu,Nestor Espinoza,Nikolay Nikolov*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study examines charge migration and residual non-linearity in JWST/NIRSpec G395H detectors using WASP-121b observations. It finds significant deviations in NRS1 vs. NRS2 and phase-dependent charge distribution effects specific to NRS1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the long-term non-linearity behavior and charge migration effects in NIRSpec detectors, crucial for accurate data interpretation in high-precision observations like those of ultra-hot Jupiters.

Method: Analyzed 37.8-hour BOTS phase curve data of WASP-121b. Evaluated charge distribution changes across planetary phases, comparing NRS1 and NRS2 detectors.

Result: NRS1 shows ~3x larger linearity deviations (charge losses at center, excesses at edges) than NRS2. Charge distribution varies with orbital phase for NRS1, altering spectral trace morphology; no such effect in NRS2.

Conclusion: Detector non-linearities and charge migration must be accounted for in NIRSpec data analysis, particularly for long duration observations requiring high photometric precision.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of charge migration and residual non-linearity on the JWST/NIRSpec G395H NRS1 and NRS2 detectors using Bright Object Time Series (BOTS) observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b. These full-orbit phase curve observations were taken over 37.8 hours (1.57 days), and provide an excellent testbed of the non-linearity behavior of NRS1 and NRS2 over long timescales. For both detectors, our analysis demonstrates charge losses at the center of the spectral trace and charge excesses at the trace edges. We find that the NRS1 detector displays ~3x larger deviations from linearity compared to NRS2. Given the large transit (~1.5%) and eclipse (~0.5%) signals for WASP-121b, we also investigate variations in the distribution of charge throughout the time-series observation. Our results show that charge distribution varies at different planetary orbital phases for NRS1, which manifests as a change in the morphology and shape of the spectral trace over the course of the time-series. The effect of charge distribution on the trace shape is not evident for NRS2.

Result: No new significant events detected. The method achieved 28% better sensitivity and 5x lower computational costs than existing methods.

Conclusion: The new method is scalable and efficient for future gravitational-wave observations, enabling better precessing BBH detection.

Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) exhibiting spin-induced orbital precession offer unique insight into compact-binary formation channels, cosmology, and tests of general relativity. We conduct a dedicated search for precessing BBHs in Advanced LIGO's third observing run (O3) using the harmonic decomposition method of precessing waveforms. We introduce a novel scheme to reduce the number of filters in a harmonic search. With our new approach, our template bank requires $5\times$ fewer filters compared to another proposed precessing search in the same region. We do not find any new significant events. Our new search method achieves up to $\sim 28\%$ improvement in sensitivity and up to $5\times$ lower computational costs compared to existing precessing search pipelines. Our method enables scalable, sensitive searches for precessing BBHs in future gravitational-wave observing runs.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new computational framework for multiple-frequency periodograms that offers super resolution beyond the Rayleigh criterion, handles arbitrary sampling, and uses statistical weighting and tapering. It demonstrates applications on synthetic data, sunspot numbers, and white dwarf pulsations, with code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional periodograms restricted by the Rayleigh criterion and handle unevenly sampled data, providing a versatile tool for time series analysis across各种数据类型.

Method: The framework uses multiple-frequency time series models with arbitrary basis functions (sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal) to compute "omnigrams". It incorporates statistical weighting, tapering, and super resolution techniques, demonstrated through examples like autoregressive models for time-domain super resolution.

Result: Successful super resolution in synthetic and real-world datasets (sunspots, white dwarf J0135+5722 pulsations), with code repository即将推出 to facilitate implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed omnigram method provides a flexible, high-resolution alternative for time series analysis, applicable to both sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal data, with potential扩展到其他应用领域 beyond frequency analysis.

Abstract: Multiple-frequency periodograms -- based on time series models consisting of two or more independent sinusoids -- have long been discussed. What is new here is the presentation of a practical, simple-to-use computational framework implementing this concept. Our algorithms have super resolution that evades the Rayleigh criterion, as well as provision for statistical weighting and tapering. They can be used for essentially any time series (e.g. time-tagged events or point measurements) with arbitrary sampling -- even or uneven. Examples of super resolution of synthetic data, sunspot numbers, and the rich pulsations of white dwarf J0135+5722, demonstrate practical applications. Appendices derive generalized periodograms using an arbitrary number of arbitrary basis functions (following Bretthorst, 1988)and define several examples of non-sinusoidal bases for these ``omnigrams.'' Application beyond the frequency domain is demonstrated with an autoregressive model exhibiting super resolution in the time domain. A GitHub repository containing omnigram code, and symbolic algebra scripts for generating it, will soon be available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently classify hundreds of thousands of unidentified Chandra sources, understand feature contributions via XAI, and enable deeper studies with limited data.

Method: Extended LightGBM model application on 277,069 Chandra sources, using SHAP values to analyze feature importance and interactions for AGN, Stars, YSOs. Focused on infrared-optical/X-ray decision boundaries.

Result: Classified 54,770 sources (>3σ) including 14,066 at >4σ. Identified infrared-optical boundaries for AGN/Stars and infrared-X-ray for YSOs. Demonstrated XAI's utility in large astronomical datasets.

Conclusion: ML with XAI reveals physically meaningful patterns beyond classification, aids in interpreting features. Public interactive catalog enables future detailed feature analysis.

Abstract: Extensive astronomical surveys, like those conducted with the {\em Chandra} X-ray Observatory, detect hundreds of thousands of unidentified cosmic sources. Machine learning (ML) methods offer an efficient, probabilistic approach to classify them, which can be useful for making discoveries and conducting deeper studies. In earlier work, we applied the LightGBM (ML model) to classify 277,069 {\em Chandra} point sources into eight categories: active galactic nuclei (AGN), X-ray emitting stars, young stellar objects (YSO), high-mass X-ray binaries, low-mass X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, cataclysmic variables, and pulsars. In this work, we present the classification table of 54,770 robustly classified sources (over $3σ$ confidence), including 14,066 sources at $>4σ$ significance. To ensure classification reliability and gain a deeper insight, we investigate the multiwavelength feature relationships learned by the LightGBM model, focusing on AGNs, Stars, and YSOs. We employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to quantify the contribution of individual features and their interactions to the predicted classification probabilities.
  Among other things, we find infrared-optical and X-ray decision boundaries for separating AGN/Stars, and infrared-X-ray boundaries for YSOs. These results are crucial for estimating object classes even with limited multiwavelength data. This study represents one of the earliest applications of XAI to large-scale astronomical datasets, demonstrating ML models' potential for uncovering physically meaningful patterns in data in addition to classification. Finally, our publicly available, extensive, and interactive catalogue will be helpful to explore the contributions of features and their combinations in greater detail in the future.

### [24] [sidmkit: A Reproducible Toolkit for SIDM Phenomenology and Galaxy Rotation-Curve Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04735)
*Nalin Dhiman*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces sidmkit, a Python package for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) calculations and rotation curve analysis, demonstrating that Burkert halo models are statistically preferred over NFW in SPARC galaxy data using Bayesian Information Criterion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIDM extends cold dark matter theory and reconciles small-scale structure issues but requires integrating microphysical models with macro observables like rotation curves. Existing tools fragmented the process, necessitating a unified, reproducible pipeline.

Method: sidmkit includes modules for velocity-dependent SIDM cross-sections (Yukawa interaction with analytic and numerical approximations), velocity-moment averaging, and Bayesian fits of Burkert/NFW models to SPARC rotation curves. Analyzed 191 galaxies with 382 total fits.

Result: Burkert halo models showed stronger preference (ΔBIC>6 in 32.5%) and majority preference (ΔBIC>0 in 65.4%) over NFW across galaxies. The package enables transparent testing of SIDM parameters against observational data.

Conclusion: sidmkit facilitates robust SIDM research by unifying micro-to-macro analyses. Results support Burkert profiles in galactic halos more than NFW, aligning with SIDM predictions and suggesting reduced need for fine-tuned cusps.

Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is a well-motivated extension of cold dark matter that can modify halo structure on galactic and group scales while remaining consistent with large-scale structure. However, practical SIDM work often requires bridging several layers, including microphysical scattering models, velocity-dependent effective cross sections, phenomenological astrophysical constraints, and (separately) data-driven halo fits, such as rotation curves. In this paper, we describe \texttt{sidmkit}, a transparent and reproducible Python package designed to support SIDM ``micro$\rightarrow$macro'' calculations and to provide a robust batch pipeline for fitting rotation curves in the SPARC data. On the SIDM side, \texttt{sidmkit} implements velocity-dependent momentum-transfer cross sections for a Yukawa interaction using standard analytic approximations (Born, classical, and Hulthén-based) with a numerical partial-wave option for spot checks. It also provides consistent velocity-moment averaging for Maxwellian relative speeds, scattering-rate utilities, and curated literature \emph{summary} constraints for regression tests and exploratory scans. On the rotation-curve side, we implement bounded non-linear least squares fits of NFW and Burkert halo models to SPARC baryonic decompositions, with optional mass-to-light priors and information-criterion summaries (AIC/BIC). For the demonstration dataset, we process 191 \texttt{rotmod} galaxies (LTG+ETG bundles) and fit both NFW and Burkert models (382 total fits). We find that Burkert is preferred by $Δ\mathrm{BIC} > 0$ for $65.4\%$ of galaxies, with ``strong'' preference ($Δ\mathrm{BIC}>6$) in $32.5\%$ of galaxies;

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of rapidly surveying large neutrino detector error regions and classifying optical transients to identify sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

Method: Deploy high-multiplex MOS on large telescopes for wide-area coverage of neutrino error circles, combined with a central IFS for detailed analysis of key candidates. This integrates with facilities like LSST, IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT, and CTAO for multi-messenger astrophysics.

Result: Enables unprecedented efficiency in spectroscopic classification and environmental characterization of UHECR candidates, facilitating coordinated observations across multiple wavelengths and messengers.

Conclusion: Such a facility would revolutionize the study of UHECR origins by bridging neutrino, optical, and gamma-ray observations, turning multi-messenger alerts into deeper physical insights.

Abstract: The search for the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) using high-energy neutrinos represents a frontier in high-energy astrophysics. However, a critical bottleneck remains: the ability to rapidly survey the sizable sky areas defined by the localization uncertainties of neutrino detectors and to provide rapid spectroscopic classification of the multitude of optical transients found within them.
  By deploying a large field-of-view with high-multiplex Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) on a large aperture telescope, one can instantaneously cover neutrino error circles, thus providing crucial spectroscopic classifications of potential counterparts discovered, for example, by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) with unprecedented efficiency. Furthermore, simultaneous operation of a giant panoramic central Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) would allow for detailed kinematic and environmental characterization of primary candidates. This facility would unlock deep synergies between next-generation neutrino telescopes (IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT) and gamma-ray observatories (CTAO), transforming unique multi-messenger alerts into a comprehensive physical understanding.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The Roman Space Telescope's survey of Type Ia supernovae uses a novel 'scene reconstruction' algorithm to mitigate host galaxy spectral contamination in slitless spectroscopy, reducing systematic errors and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid systematic bias in dark energy parameter inference caused by host galaxy light contaminating supernova spectra in wide-field surveys.

Method: Develops a 3D scene reconstruction algorithm using multi-roll-angle spectroscopic data to model host galaxy spectra, allowing accurate subtraction of contamination from supernova spectra projections.

Result: Simulations show the method produces minimal systematic errors and lower noise compared to traditional subtraction methods using pre/post supernova host spectra.

Conclusion: This approach enables reliable use of supernova spectra for precision dark energy studies, critical for maximizing scientific return of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will carry out a wide-field imaging and slitless spectroscopic survey of Type Ia Supernovae to improve our understanding of dark energy. Crucial to this endeavor is obtaining supernova spectra uncontaminated by light from their host galaxies. However, obtaining such spectra is made more difficult by the inherent problem in wide-field slitless spectroscopic surveys: the blending of spectra of close objects. The spectrum of a supernova will blend with the host galaxy, even from regions distant from the supernova on the sky. If not properly removed, this contamination will introduce systematic bias when the supernova spectra are later used to determine intrinsic supernova parameters and to infer the parameters of dark energy. To address this problem we developed an algorithm that makes use of the spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy at all available observatory roll angles to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3d; 2d spatial, 1d spectral) representation of the underlying host galaxy that accurately matches the 2d slitless spectrum of the host galaxy when projected to an arbitrary rotation angle. We call this ``scene reconstruction''. The projection of the reconstructed scene can be subtracted from an observation of a supernova to remove the contamination from the underlying host. Using simulated Roman data, we show that our method has extremely small systematic errors and significantly less random noise than if we subtracted a single perfectly aligned spectrum of the host obtained before or after the supernova was visible.

### [27] [Spectator Composes a Gravitational Canon: Spectator-field-triggered Phase Transition During Inflation and its Anisotropic Gravitational Wave Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04307)
*Yunjia Bao,Keisuke Harigaya*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework where a spectator field's slow-roll during inflation triggers a phase transition, forming defects that generate anisotropic gravitational-wave signals through modulated timing by quantum fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain how cosmic inflation can produce detectable gravitational-wave signals with anisotropies, leveraging spectator fields and phase transitions.

Method: Proposes a general framework using a spectator field's slow-roll dynamics to trigger a phase transition; models defect formation and cosmic evolution of resultant gravitational waves, using the SUSY Higgs as a specific example.

Result: Shows that quantum fluctuations modulate transition timing, imprinting large-scale anisotropies in the GW background; the mechanism applies broadly to spectator-modulated phenomena.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generic method for producing anisotropic GW signals, with potential observability through future gravitational-wave detectors.

Abstract: We propose a general framework in which a phase transition is triggered during cosmic inflation by the slow-roll dynamics of a spectator field. The topological defects formed at the transition are inflated outside the horizon, reenter it after inflation, and can subsequently generate characteristic gravitational-wave (GW) signals. Quantum fluctuations of the spectator field modulate the timing of the transition, imprinting large-scale anisotropies in the resulting GW background. As an explicit realization, the spectator field may be identified with the Higgs field in a supersymmetric Standard Model. More generally, our framework applies to a wide class of spectator-modulated phenomena, providing a generic mechanism for producing anisotropic GW signals.

### [28] [Threshold resummation of rapidity distributions at fixed partonic rapidity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04309)
*Lorenzo De Ros,Stefano Forte,Giovanni Ridolfi,Davide Maria Tagliabue*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a generalized renormalization-group approach for threshold resummation of rapidity distributions in Drell-Yan and Higgs production, validated against NNLO fixed-order results and reconciled with SCET-derived methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision in perturbative QCD calculations by extending threshold resummation techniques for processes with colorless final states, ensuring agreement between renormalization-group and SCET approaches.

Method: Generalized renormalization-group framework applied to threshold resummation at fixed rapidity, validated using NNLO Drell-Yan data and compared with SCET results to confirm consistency.

Result: Successfully derived all-order resummation expressions, determined NNLL coefficients through NNLO comparison, and confirmed equivalence with SCET-derived results in the quark nonsinglet channel.

Conclusion: The method achieves precise resummation matching SCET predictions, enhancing theoretical predictions for LHC observables in threshold regions.

Abstract: We derive a general expression for the resummation of rapidity distributions for processes with a colorless final state, such as Drell-Yan or Higgs production, in the limit in which the center-of-mass energy goes on threshold, but with fixed rapidity of the Higgs or gauge boson in the partonic center-of-mass frame. The result is obtained by suitably generalizing the renormalization-group based approach to threshold resummation previously pursued by us. The ensuing expression is valid to all logarithmic orders but the resummation coefficients must be determined by comparing to fixed order results. We perform this comparison for the Drell-Yan process using the fixed-order next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO) result, thereby determining resummation coefficients up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, for the quark-antiquark coefficient function in the quark nonsinglet channel. We provide a translation to direct QCD of a result for this resummation previously obtained using SCET methods, and we show that it agrees with our own.

### [29] [Metastable cosmic strings are broken at the start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04320)
*Lorenzo Tranchedone,Ethan Carragher,Edward Hardy,Natálie Koscelanská van IJcken*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the breakdown mechanisms of metastable cosmic strings, showing that they break early due to thermal effects or monopole interactions, leading to super-horizon segments that delay network destruction. It updates string survival constraints and discusses quantum tunnelling's role, finding higher tension points accelerate breaking. Additionally, it explores analogous behavior in dark QCD flux tubes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve discrepancies in previous estimates of cosmic string survival times and clarify whether early breaking or late quantum tunnelling primarily drives network destruction, while extending analysis to hidden sector flux tubes.

Method: Analyzes string breaking via finite-temperature effects and monopole interactions through network percolation models, simulates quantum tunnelling rates focusing on high-tension points, and applies these insights to dark QCD flux tube scenarios.

Result: Shows early breaking dominates over quantum tunnelling in destroying string networks; revised survival condition requires $m_M^2/μ \\\\(\\gsim\\\\ 10^3\\\$; quantum tunnelling occurs faster at high-tension points; analogous dynamics apply to dark QCD flux tubes.

Conclusion: Early thermal and monopole-induced breaking mechanisms are critical for cosmic string network evolution, superseding prior assumptions. New constraints significantly raise the required monopole-to-string energy ratio. Quantum tunnelling's importance is overestimated without considering tension non-uniformity, with implications for hidden sector models.

Abstract: We show that metastable cosmic strings break at early times, either via finite-temperature effects or by attaching to pre-existing monopoles during network percolation. The resulting segments can be initially super-horizon in size and thus persist for a significant amount of time. If the strings do not re-percolate, the network's eventual destruction is typically due to this early-time breaking rather than late-time quantum tunnelling. Survival of strings to epochs probed by NANOGrav requires $m_M^2/μ\gtrsim 10^3$, where $m_M$ and $μ$ are the monopole mass and the string tension respectively, over an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates. We also revisit quantum-tunnelling induced breaking. Results from numerical simulations suggest that this occurs mainly at rare high-tension points on the strings, yielding a rate much larger than is usually assumed. We briefly discuss the related scenario of flux tubes in a dark QCD-like hidden sector with dark-quark masses above the confinement scale.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified study of vector and axial-vector mesons and their diquark partners' screening masses using a symmetry-preserving approach, analyzing their thermal behavior across various temperatures. It confirms chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures and paves the way for future baryon studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive understanding of meson and diquark screening masses at finite temperatures, validate theoretical models against experimental data, and explore chiral symmetry restoration.

Method: Employed a symmetry-preserving vector-vector contact interaction approach to analyze longitudinal and transverse modes of screening masses for mesons and diquarks composed of light/heavy quarks. Compared results with existing theories and experimental data at T=0 MeV, and checked high-temperature limits.

Result: Predictions match experimental data at T=0 and align with free theory limits at high temperatures. Parity partners of light mesons/diquarks converge at high temperatures, indicating chiral symmetry restoration.

Conclusion: The approach successfully unifies meson and diquark thermal behavior, confirms chiral symmetry restoration, and establishes a foundation for extending the model to baryon studies via quark-diquark interactions.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the screening masses of vector and axial-vector mesons and their corresponding diquark partners within a symmetry-preserving vector-vector contact interaction approach. Our analysis includes mesons and diquarks composed of both light and heavy quarks, providing a unified description of their thermal behavior. The longitudinal and transverse modes of the screening masses are analyzed, and the results are systematically compared with other theoretical approaches. At $T = 0$ MeV, our predictions agree with available experimental data, and a comparison with the expected free theory limit at high temperatures is also presented. Notably, the parity partners of the lightest mesons and diquarks converge at high temperatures, signaling chiral symmetry restoration within this framework. These results provide a consistent and detailed picture of meson and diquark properties at finite temperature and lay the groundwork for extending the capabilities of the model to baryon screening masses in the quark-diquark picture.

### [31] [$S^\prime_4$ Quark Flavour Model in the Vicinity of the Fixed Point $τ= i\infty$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04529)
*S. T. Petcov,M. Tanimoto*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores a bottom-up approach using the S'4 modular symmetry in a minimal flavor model to generate quark mass hierarchies, mixing, and CP-violation without fine-tuning. It employs a fixed point with modulus VEV, achieving a viable model consistent with CKM matrix elements under certain supersymmetry conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating quark mass hierarchies and explaining CP violation in the quark sector without fine-tuning, while avoiding the difficulties of spontaneous CP violation in minimal modular models.

Method: A flavor model with S'_4 modular symmetry operating near τ_T = i∞, assuming τ_vev ≈ τ_T. This setup allows hierarchical quark masses and addresses CP violation through explicit breaking. Statistical analysis is performed against CKM matrix data

Result: The model effectively describes ten quark observables with nine parameters. It remains viable, especially under high supersymmetry breaking scales, aligning with |V_ub|, |V_cb| experimental values and decay data.

Conclusion: The S'_4 modular symmetry framework successfully generates quark properties in a predictive and minimally parameterized way. Explicit CP violation resolves issues with spontaneous models, and the model's consistency with experiment is demonstrated under specific supersymmetry conditions.

Abstract: We study in the bottom-up framework the possibility to generate the quark mass hierarchies without fine-tuning, the quark mixing and CP-violation (CPV) in a flavour model with $S^\prime_4$ modular symmetry having minimal number of parameters. The model is considered in the vicinity of the fixed point $τ_\text{T}= i\infty$, $τ_\text{vev} \sim τ_\text{T}$, $τ_\text{vev}$ being the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the modulus $τ$, which allows to explain the hierarchies of the quark masses. The ten quark observables are described by nine real parameters. The CP-symmetry is broken explicitly since, as is well known, reproducing the observed CPV in the quark sector in the case of spontaneous breaking of CP-symmetry by $τ_\text{vev}$ is highly problematic in the class of minimal modular quark flavour models (explaining the quark mass hierarchies without fine-tuning) of the type we consider. We perform a statistical analysis of the model and show that it is phenomenologically viable and consistent, in particular, with the ``inclusive'' decay data on the $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ elements of the CKM matrix and, in the case of a very high scale of supersymmetry breaking, with the current ``average'' experimental values of $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper describes an experiment searching for ultralight axion dark matter by detecting axion-induced torques on a levitated ferromagnetic torsional oscillator, with results setting both corrected and uncorrected upper limits on the axion-electron coupling constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to detect ultralight axion dark matter, which is a leading candidate for dark matter particles, by directly measuring its effect through spin interactions using a sensitive torsional oscillator system.

Method: The method involves using a levitated ferromagnetic torsional oscillator with high spin density and mechanical isolation to measure axion-induced torques. A likelihood-based statistical analysis accounts for axion field fluctuations, and shielding effects are considered to correct for potential signal attenuation.

Result: No significant signal was observed at the tested frequency (~2e-14 eV). The experiment set 90% CL upper limits on the axion-electron coupling constant (g_aee < 1e-7 uncorrected, <6e-5 corrected for shielding attenuation).

Conclusion: While current constraints are presented, the study highlights that future improvements (e.g., cryogenics, better shielding) could significantly enhance sensitivity, paving the way for more stringent axion dark matter detection limits.

Abstract: We present a search for ultralight axion dark matter coupled to electron spins using a levitated ferromagnetic torsional oscillator (FMTO). This platform directly measures axion-induced torques on a macroscopic spin-polarized body, combining large spin density with strong mechanical isolation to probe magnetic fluctuations below 10 Hz while suppressing gradient-field noise. In a first implementation, the experiment yielded 18000 s of analyzable data at room temperature under high vacuum with optical readout and triple-layer magnetic shielding. A likelihood-based statistical framework, incorporating stochastic fluctuations in the axion-field amplitude, was used to evaluate the data. No excess consistent with an axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field was observed near 2e-14 eV. To account for possible shielding-induced signal attenuation, we quantify its effect and report both the uncorrected (g_aee < 1e-7) and attenuation-corrected (g_aee < 6e-5) 90% CL limits on the axion-electron coupling. Looking ahead, improvements guided by both noise-budget analysis and shielding-attenuation considerations, including optimized levitation geometry, cryogenic operation, and superconducting shielding, are expected to boost sensitivity by multiple orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: The paper provides a detailed analysis of CP violation in QCD, addressing claims that question its existence. It examines the dependence of chiral quark and CP-violating gluon condensates on the theta parameter and quark masses in the chiral limit, reaffirming the existence of strong CP violation and supporting the foundations of axion physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address recent claims questioning the existence of strong CP violation by providing a pedagogical yet rigorous review of CP violation in QCD.

Method: Analyzes the QCD partition function properties to study theta parameter and quark mass dependencies of chiral quark and gluon condensates. Examines axial U(1) anomaly and ordering of infinite-volume limits within the large-N framework.

Result: Reaffirms strong CP violation for physically relevant parameters, confirming the theoretical basis of the strong CP problem and axion physics.

Conclusion: The study validates the necessity for solutions like axion physics to address the strong CP problem, as CP violation remains a fundamental aspect of QCD under physical conditions.

Abstract: Motivated by recent claims questioning the existence of strong CP violation, we present a pedagogical review of CP violation in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Using fundamental properties of the QCD partition function, we analyze the dependence of the chiral quark and CP violating gluon condensates on the theta parameter and the quark masses in the chiral limit. We show explicitly how CP violation arises, clarify the role of the axial U(1) anomaly and the ordering of the infinite-volume limit, and discuss the conditions under which CP symmetry may or may not be realized, including in the large-N framework. Our results reaffirm the presence of strong CP violation for physically relevant parameters and thus the theoretical basis of the strong CP problem and axion physics.

### [34] [Dark NSI & neutrino oscillations : probing via $δ_{CP}$ measurements at DUNE and T2HK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04802)
*Dharitree Bezboruah,Abinash Medhi,Moon Moon Devi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how interactions between neutrinos and a scalar dark matter field affect neutrino oscillations in long-baseline experiments like DUNE and T2HK. It finds that dark non-standard interactions (dark NSI) can either enhance or suppress CP-violation sensitivity depending on dark phases, and the combination of DUNE and T2HK can mitigate these phase-induced degeneracies to improve CP sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of dark matter interactions on neutrino oscillation parameters and CP violation measurements, addressing potential systematic uncertainties from a scalar dark matter background in upcoming long-baseline experiments.

Method: The authors calculate medium-induced mass-squared corrections from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos with dark matter, derive modified oscillation probabilities incorporating dark NSI phases and off-diagonal elements, and simulate experimental outcomes for DUNE and T2HK.

Result: Dark NSI phases significantly affect CP-violation sensitivity; the synergistic use of DUNE and T2HK can resolve parameter degeneracies, potentially restoring or enhancing CP sensitivity compared to standard oscillation scenarios.

Conclusion: Long-baseline experiments must account for dark matter interactions to avoid biased CP violation interpretations. Combined analyses of DUNE and T2HK are crucial to disentangle dark NSI effects and ensure accurate determinations of oscillation parameters.

Abstract: We investigate the possibility of neutrinos interacting with a scalar dark matter field and the resulting implications for neutrino oscillations in the long-baseline sector. As our Universe is predominantly composed of dark matter, neutrinos propagating over astrophysical and terrestrial baselines inevitably traverse a dark matter background. The coherent forward scattering of neutrinos in such a background induces a medium-dependent correction to the mass-squared term in the effective neutrino Hamiltonian having opposing signs for neutrinos and antineutrinos. We study how the elements of this correction matrix, arising from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos with scalar dark matter background referred to as dark non-standard interactions (dark NSI), modify neutrino oscillation probabilities. Furthermore, we also study the effect of the off-diagonal elements and the associated phases on the measurement of leptonic CP violating phase focusing on the upcoming long-baseline superbeam experiments DUNE and T2HK. We show that dark NSI can lead to substantial enhancement or suppression of CP-violation sensitivity, depending on the true values of the dark NSI phases $φ_{αβ}$. We further explored how the synergy of DUNE and T2HK can effectively mitigate the degeneracies due to the dark NSI phases, and can restore or even enhance the CP sensitivity as compared to the standard oscillation scenario.

### [35] [Braneworld Baryogenesis and QCD-Era Magnetogenesis: A Predictive Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04828)
*Michaël Sarrazin*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study shows that primordial magnetic fields (PMF) are crucial for the braneworld baryogenesis model, requiring PMF strengths of ~10^10 T post-quark-hadron transition. Magnetic fluctuations create a baryon-density spectrum matching CMB constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how the braneworld baryogenesisscenario, relying on C/CP violation from coupled matter-antimatter sectors via a pseudo-scalar field, can robustly produce the observed baryon asymmetry.

Method: Incorporated realistic stochastic PMF into a semi-analytical framework to model baryogenesis post-quark-hadron transition, analyzing magnetic field effects on baryon density spectra and isocurvature constraints.

Result: PMF strengths of ~10^10 T are necessary right after the quark-hadron transition. Magnetic fluctuations lead to white noise in baryon-density spectrum on large scales, aligning with CMB bounds.

Conclusion: Establishes a predictive connection between braneworld baryogenesis and early-Universe magnetic fields, validating PMF's role in achieving observed baryon asymmetry under CMB-compatible conditions.

Abstract: We demonstrate that primordial magnetic fields (PMF) play a decisive role in the braneworld baryogenesis scenario of [Phys. Rev. D $\textbf{110}$, 023520 (2024)], where C/CP violation arises from the coupling of visible and hidden matter-antimatter sectors through a pseudo-scalar field. Although this mechanism generates baryon number efficiently only after the quark-hadron transition, by incorporating a realistic stochastic PMF within a semi-analytical framework, we find that matching the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry robustly requires PMF strengths of order $10^{10}$ T right after the transition, in agreement with causal QCD-era magnetogenesis. We further reveal that magnetic fluctuations drive the baryon-density spectrum to white noise on large scales, yielding an isocurvature component compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds. This establishes a predictive link between the braneworld baryogenesis model and realistic early-Universe magnetic fields.

TL;DR: The paper uses NLO QCD sum rules to analyze $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ light four-quark states, finding no evidence for a $\sim 1.4\,\text{GeV}$ state, contradicting previous LO studies and aligning with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the existence of $1^{-+}$ light four-quark states, specifically addressing discrepancies in prior leading-order (LO) studies that proposed the $π_1(1400)$ exotic state, and to reconcile theoretical predictions with experimental observations.

Method: NLO (Next-to-Leading Order) QCD sum rules analysis of tetraquark and four-quark molecule states, examining both compact tetraquark and molecular structures for $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ configurations.

Result: No four-quark states with masses around $1.4\,\text{GeV}$ were found, which contradicts previous LO-based interpretations of the $π_1(1400)$ state.

Conclusion: The results do not support the existence of the $π_1(1400)$ exotic state, agreeing with current experimental data and highlighting limitations of leading-order analyses in this context.

Abstract: We present an NLO QCD sum rules analysis of $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ light four-quark states, investigated several compact tetraquark and four-quark molecule states, we obtain $1^{-+}$ light four-quark states masses,. Crucially, we have not find four-quark states with mass $\sim 1.4\,\text{GeV}$, which is the interpreted to be $π_1(1400)$ exotic state in previous leading-order studies. This result do not support the existence of $π_1(1400)$ state, agrees with the current experimental observation.

*Amit Adhikary,Dilip Kumar Ghosh,Sk Jeesun,Sourov Roy*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the sensitivity of the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to electrophilic new physics, specifically axion-like particles (ALPs) and a new Z' boson, focusing on tri-electron and photon final states in electron-proton collisions. The EIC is shown to significantly extend constraints on these particles where current experiments are limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to explore the potential of the future EIC in probing poorly constrained regions of parameter space for electrophilic new physics, such as ALPs and Z' bosons, which are not well explored by existing experiments. These particles, coupling only to electrons, offer a unique testing ground for beyond-Standard-Model physics.

Method: The authors use an effective field theory framework to model ALPs and Z' bosons that interact exclusively with electrons. They simulate electron-proton collisions at 141 GeV center-of-mass energy with 100 fb⁻¹ luminosity, analyzing both tri-electron and photon final states (via ALP-photon loops). Detector effects and systematic uncertainties are incorporated to project exclusion limits on cross-sections and couplings.

Result: EIC's projected exclusion limits are found to significantly extend sensitivity to ALPs and Z' bosons in parameter regions currently weakly constrained by experiments. This provides a new collider reach for electrophilic new physics at the GeV scale.

Conclusion: The EIC offers enhanced sensitivity to electrophilic new physics scenarios like ALPs and Z' bosons. The results demonstrate the collider's unique role in complementing existing searches and opening new discovery potential for beyond-Standard-Model particles interacting primarily with electrons.

Abstract: We study the sensitivity of the upcoming electron-ion (EIC) collider to purely electrophilic new physics in the GeV mass range. Within an effective field theory framework, we consider two different scenarios: an axion-like particle (ALP) and a new heavy neutral vector gauge boson $Z^\prime $, each couples to electrons only. We analyze electron-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 141$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of $100~{\rm fb}^{-1}$, focusing primarily on the tri-electron final state. Additionally, loop-induced ALP-photon couplings driven photon final states are also explored. Incorporating realistic detector effects and systematic uncertainties, we obtain projected exclusion limits on the relevant cross-sections and couplings. We find that the results from EIC can significantly extend the sensitivity to electrophilic axion-like particles and $Z^\prime $ bosons in regions of parameter space that remain weakly constrained by existing experiments.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper extends the effective-range expansion (ERE) to a higher-order relativistic framework, incorporating relativistic kinematics and left-hand cut contributions for improved analysis of near-threshold DD* scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of the nonrelativistic ERE in handling relativistic effects and higher-order terms, ensuring reliability and systematic improvement in describing low-energy scattering processes involving particle exchange.

Method: The authors generalized the ERE up to O(k⁶), incorporated relativistic kinematics, and included left-hand cut contributions. They systematically tested the extended model's robustness and compared it with the nonrelativistic version.

Result: The extended ERE demonstrated improved reliability and robustness, successfully accounting for relativistic effects in near-threshold scattering. It provides a systematically improvable framework for two-body scattering problems with particle exchange.

Conclusion: The relativistic ERE framework is confirmed as a robust and flexible tool for analyzing low-energy scattering processes, offering both analytical clarity and numerical accuracy, especially in systems like DD* where relativistic effects are significant.

Abstract: A model-independent parameterization of the low-energy scattering amplitude that incorporates the left-hand cut from one-particle exchange, an extension of the conventional effective-range expansion (ERE), was recently proposed and successfully applied to the low-energy $DD^*$ system [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 011903 (2025)]. While the original formulation is based on a nonrelativistic approximation and is thus limited to a [1,1] approximant for self-consistency, we extend the framework by explicitly including the higher-order terms up to $\mathcal{O}(k^6)$. We systematically investigate the reliability and robustness of the generalized ERE by incorporating relativistic kinematic effects. In addition, we develop a relativistic version of the ERE that accounts for lhc contributions. These results affirm the generalized ERE as a robust and systematically improvable framework for near-threshold scattering processes, providing both analytical and numerical reliability for applications in two-body scattering problems with a particle exchange.

### [39] [Axion superradiance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05055)
*Francesca Chadha-Day*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses using rotating black hole spins to constrain light bosons like axions via superradiance, considering astrophysical environments and stellar interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how superradiance effects can constrain the existence of light bosons (e.g., axions) by observing black hole spin-down, while addressing environmental complexities and probing non-gravitational interactions.

Method: Analyzes the connection between superradiance-driven boson amplification and black hole/neutron star spin depletion, considering environmental factors and stellar interactions. Reviews current research and outlines future observational/experimental strategies.

Result: Highlights potential constraints on axion masses at low couplings through spinning black hole observations, emphasizes importance of incorporating astrophysical environments, and identifies stellar processes as additional probes for boson interactions.

Conclusion: Stresses superradiance as a powerful tool for dark matter/axion searches, noting ongoing challenges and future directions in accounting for complex astrophysical conditions and improving observational techniques.

Abstract: Light bosonic fields may suffer an instability around a rotating compact object. This process, known as superradiance, leads to the exponential amplification of the field around a black hole or neutron star, while the spin of the central object is correspondingly depleted. The discovery of a highly spinning black hole could therefore be used to constrain the existence of light bosons such as axions in a particular range of masses. These constraints apply for very low non-gravitational couplings between the boson and the Standard Model, offering a powerful search strategy for new physics. However, care must be taken to include the more complex effects of the black hole's astrophysical environment. Conversely, stellar superradiance could allow us to probe additional non-gravitational interactions between a new boson at the stellar matter. In this article, I will discuss the current status and future directions of axion superradiance. This is a contribution to the proceedings of the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers.

### [41] [Non-Thermal Leptogenesis in the BLSM with Inverse Seesaw Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05186)
*David Delepine,Shaaban Khalil*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores non-thermal leptogenesis in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended Standard Model with inverse seesaw mechanism. It shows successful baryogenesis via non-thermal processes, resolving thermal leptogenesis limitations via $B-L$ Higgs decays, requiring careful tuning of the scalar mass spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the viability of leptogenesis in models with $B-L$ symmetry and inverse seesaw, where thermal processes fail due to strong washouts from $O(1)$ neutrino Yukawas. The aim is to demonstrate a viable non-thermal pathway that avoids these issues.

Method: Analysis of non-thermal leptogenesis through $B-L$ Higgs ($χ$) decay producing RH neutrinos. Investigates interplay between reheating temperature scale $T_R$, $M_χ$, and ISS washout effects. Derives conditions for sufficient lepton asymmetry generation with suppressed washout.

Result: Successful non-thermal leptogenesis is possible with tuned scalar masses enabling low $T_R$ values. Lepton asymmetry conversion via sphalerons matches observed baryon asymmetry. Model remains predictive under these parameters.

Conclusion: The $U(1)_{B-L}$ ISS model can robustly explain baryogenesis through non-thermal mechanisms, offering a viable alternative to thermal leptogenesis in scenarios with strong washout. Scalar mass tuning is critical for compatibility with observational constraints.

Abstract: We investigate the viability of non-thermal leptogenesis in the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model (BLSM) with an inverse seesaw (ISS) mechanism for neutrino mass generation. In this framework, right-handed neutrinos typically have $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings, which induce strong washout effects and render conventional thermal leptogenesis ineffective. We demonstrate that a successful baryogenesis scenario can nevertheless be realized through non-thermal leptogenesis, where right-handed neutrinos are produced from the decay of the heavy $B\!-\!L$ Higgs boson $χ$. We explicitly analyze the interplay between the dilution factor $T_R/M_χ$ and the washout parameter characteristic of the ISS, highlighting the tension between suppressing washout effects and maintaining sufficient reheating. We show that a viable lepton asymmetry can be generated provided the scalar mass spectrum is appropriately tuned, allowing for a reduced reheating temperature while keeping washout under control. The resulting lepton asymmetry is efficiently converted into the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via sphaleron processes. Our results establish that the inverse-seesaw $B\!-\!L$ model remains a predictive and robust framework for non-thermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis.

### [42] [Color-Singlet and Color-Octet Quark Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01879)
*Cheuk-Yin Wong*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the concept of color-singlet quark matter composed of quark-antiquark pairs, proposing that neutral color-singlet quark matter can form stable QED mesons at specific energy levels (17 MeV and 38 MeV). These mesons could be evidenced by anomalous photon and boson observations in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate unexplored color-singlet quark matter and its potential to form stable QED mesons, which may explain observed anomalies in experimental data from CERN, ATOMKI, DUBNA, and HUS.

Method: Theoretical analysis of quark-antiquark interactions within the color-singlet and color-octet frameworks, separating two-flavor quark matter into charged and neutral components. Reference is made to earlier studies (PRC81,064903(2010) and JHEP(2020(8),165)) for QED meson formation at specific energy levels.

Result: Proposes that neutral color-singlet quark matter forms QED mesons at 17 MeV and 38 MeV. Suggests experimental anomalies (soft photons, specific-mass bosons) as potential evidence for these mesons.

Conclusion: The existence of QED mesons as signatures of neutral color-singlet quark matter at zero temperature requires further experimental confirmation but offers a new direction in quark matter research.

Abstract: Quarks and antiquarks carry color and electric charges and belong to the color-triplet $3$ group and the color-antitriplet $\bar 3$ group respectively. The product groups of $3$ and $\bar 3$ consist of the color-singlet $1$ and the color-octet $8$ subgroups. Therefore, quarks and antiquarks combine to form color-singlet $[q \bar q]^1$ quark matter and color-octet $[q \bar q]^8$ quark matter. The color-octet quark matter corresponds to the $q\bar q$ quark matter as envisaged in the realm of present knowledge but the color-singlet quark matter is as yet unexplored and now submitted for exploration. The color-singlet quark matter with two flavors can be separated into charged and neutral color-singlet quark matters. In the neutral color-singlet quark matter, the quark and the antiquark interacting only in the QED interaction may form stable and confined colorless QED mesons non-perturbatively at about 17 MeV and 38 MeV (PRC81,064903(2010) and JHEP(2020(8),165). It is proposed that the possible existence of the QED mesons may be a signature of the neutral color-singlet quark matter at $T=0$. The observations of the anomalous soft photons at CERN, and the anomalous bosons with mass about 17 MeV at ATOMKI, DUBNA, and HUS, and mass about 38 MeV at DUBNA hold promising experimental evidence for the existence of such QED mesons, pending further confirmations.

### [43] [A Relativistic MOND](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04290)
*Tejinder P. Singh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a minimal relativistic completion of MOND that recovers General Relativity in high-acceleration regimes and the AQUAL equation in low-acceleration regimes without introducing extra fields. It uses an $E_6×E_6$ framework to derive a repulsive interaction and an IR metric deformation governed by a conformal symmetry principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of standard MOND frameworks by embedding MOND into a relativistic theory that reproduces GR in the appropriate regime and avoids ad hoc fields or cosmological constants, addressing inconsistencies in cosmological expansion.

Method: The method involves an $E_6×E_6$ gauge group breaking to $SU(3)_R→SU(2)_R×U(1)_{Y'}→U(1)_{	ext{dem}}$, using the $SU(2)_R$ connection for Plebanski/MacDowell-Mansouri gravity emergence. An IR metric deformation $\Delta S_{\text{IR}}[g]$ with a conformal invariant action under SO(4,1) ensures the low-acceleration MOND behavior while preserving GR at high accelerations.

Result: Successfully constructs a relativistic MOND theory with exact GR recovery and AQUAL emergence, implementing MOND via IR deformations controlled by a dynamically chosen de Sitter radius, eliminating the need for a cosmological constant and providing a consistent cosmological framework.

Conclusion: The framework unifies MOND with GR in a gauge-theoretic relativistic model, resolving previous issues in cosmological compatibility and offering a coherent description of gravitational dynamics across all scales, supported by symmetry principles and minimal field assumptions.

Abstract: We present a minimal relativistic completion of MOND in which (i) General Relativity is recovered exactly in the high-acceleration regime, while (ii) the Bekenstein--Milgrom (AQUAL) equation emerges in the low-acceleration regime, without introducing additional propagating fields beyond those already present in a right-handed gauge sector. The construction is motivated by an $E_6\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\rightarrow SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y'}\rightarrow U(1)_{\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $ΔS_{\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(ξ\,\ell_{\rm dS})$ with $ξ={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit. MOND resides in perturbations and quasistatic systems; the homogeneous FRW background is controlled by the IR vacuum kinematics rather than an ad hoc cosmological constant.

### [44] [Could black hole thermodynamics play a role in black hole mergers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04379)
*George Ruppeiner*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores whether the observed clustering of black hole remnant spins around a ≈ 0.687, post binary black hole mergers, could be linked to the Davies phase transition point (a = 0.68125) in black hole thermodynamics. It proposes a thermodynamic fluctuation theory incorporating appropriate fluctuating variables and thermal equilibrium conditions (via Hawking temperature and Novikov-Thorne accretion disks) to justify such a connection, suggesting remnants might dynamically attract towards the Davies point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if the observed clustering of spin values in merger remnants is not random but indicates a thermodynamic phase transition at the Davies point, requiring frameworks to validate this hypothesis.

Method: Constructs a thermodynamic fluctuation theory based on Kerr black hole thermodynamics and Novikov-Thorne accretion disk models to ensure valid fluctuating variables and thermal equilibrium between the black hole's Hawking temperature (~μK) and the cosmic microwave background (~3K).

Result: Demonstrates that the required thermodynamic framework is feasible, though the dynamical model driving remnants toward the Davies point remains unknown. Finds partial alignment between observed spin clustering and the phase transition value.

Conclusion: The proximity of observed spins to the Davies transition suggests a possible thermodynamic attractor mechanism, urging further exploration of dynamical models explaining this behavior within black hole thermodynamics.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\bar{a}=0.6869\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\sim μK$ and the outside universe $\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.

### [45] [Future Rip Scenarios in Fractional Holographic Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04414)
*Ayush Bidlan,Paulo Moniz,Oem Trivedi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates late-time cosmological singularities (big, little, pseudo rips) in the context of interacting Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE) with Granda-Oliveros (GO) and Hubble cutoffs. It finds that the GO cutoff supports big rips for 1<α≤2 and rejects pseudo-rips. The Hubble cutoff allows little and pseudo-rips under specific interaction conditions, supported by numerical analysis of EoS and sound speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the viability of different rip scenarios under varying cutoff models (GO and Hubble) in FHDE, clarifying the constraints on Lévy's index α and interaction terms Q for cosmological singularities.

Method: Analyzes FHDE with GO cutoff L=(γH²+δḢ)^(-1/2) and Hubble cutoff L=H⁻¹. Derives conditions for singularity types based on α values. Applies an ansatz-based approach for H(t) in little/pseudo-rip scenarios, examines EoS and SSS dynamics in linear/non-linear Q regimes via numerical plots.

Result: Demonstrates big rip occurs for 1<α≤2 under GO cutoff; pseudo-rip requires α>2 (invalidating it in GO). Hubble cutoff with nonlinear Q enables little/pseudo rips. Numerical plots confirm validity of these singularities' cosmological parameters evolution.

Conclusion: FHDE framework with Hubble cutoff better accommodates little/pseudo-rip singularities when interaction term Q acts nonlinearly, whereas GO cutoff restricts possibilities. The study provides critical constraints on α and Q forms for singularity occurrence.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the occurrence of late-time cosmological singularities, namely, the rip scenarios within the framework of interacting Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(γH^{2}+δ\dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $α$ (Lévy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1<α\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $α>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\sim(γH^{2}+g(H))^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.

*Carlos E. Romero-Figueroa,Hernando Quevedo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores phase transitions in cosmological spacetimes with quantum gravity corrections via GUP, resolving inconsistencies in thermodynamic models and revealing universality through GTD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incompatibility between Hayward's gravitational first law and thermodynamic equations under time-dependent apparent horizons, caused by cosmological phase transitions requiring non-dark energy equations of state.

Method: Modeling cosmological horizons as quasi-homogeneous systems using GUP-corrected FLRW models, treating the GUP parameter as a thermodynamic variable, and applying Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) to analyze phase transitions.

Result: GUP parameter fluctuations produce phase transitions similar to black holes, with GTD scalar curvature showing critical exponents near 1, independent of equilibrium space dimensions.

Conclusion: Quantum gravity effects via GUP restore thermodynamic consistency in cosmology, highlight universality in gravitational thermodynamics, and validate GTD as a tool for spacetime microstructure analysis.

Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions in cosmological spacetimes shows that their existence requires a time-dependent apparent horizon radius, which in turn implies an equation of state different from that of a dark energy fluid. This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems. Our findings confirm GTD as a powerful geometric tool to unveil the emergent thermodynamic microstructure of spacetime.

### [47] [Inflationary Dynamics and Perturbations in Fractal Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04691)
*Aarav Shah,Paulo Moniz,Maxim Khlopov,Oem Trivedi,Maxim Krasnov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores inflationary dynamics in a fractal cosmology model, where spacetime has a non-integer effective dimension. Using modified Friedmann and continuity equations with a fractal dimension D, the authors derive slow-roll parameters for different inflationary potentials and extend the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation to include fractal effects. They find that the scalar spectral index ns is influenced by D and a fractional scale L, with constraints from Planck 2018 data limiting D to near 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how fractal geometry in cosmology, through a relaxation of the standard cosmological principle, affects inflationary dynamics and observable parameters like the scalar spectral index. This challenges traditional assumptions about smooth spacetime and offers a new framework to explain cosmological observations.

Method: The authors modify the Friedmann and continuity equations with an effective fractal dimension D and derive generalized slow-roll parameters for cubic, Starobinsky, and Natural inflation models. They introduce a fractal-modified Mukhanov-Sasaki equation using an effective momentum term k_eff, which accounts for fractal spatial Laplacian effects on scalar perturbations.

Result: The fractal deformation introduces corrections to the power spectrum and scalar spectral index ns, which depend on D and L. Constraints from Planck 2018 data restrict D to approximately 2.7–3, depending on the specific inflationary and cosmological model parameters.

Conclusion: Fractal cosmology provides a viable framework to explain inflationary observables within allowed parameter ranges. The analysis highlights that minor fractal spacetime distortions (near D=3) can align with current cosmological data, suggesting potential for testing non-integer-dimensional spacetime hypotheses in cosmology.

Abstract: We study inflationary dynamics within the framework of fractal cosmology, where spacetime exhibits a non-integer effective dimension, sourced through a relaxation of the cosmological principle. Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\lesssim D\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed.

### [48] [Dynamical system approach to the spectral (in)stability of black holes under localised potential perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04892)
*T. Torres,S. R. Dolan*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates how localized delta-function perturbations affect the resonant spectra (quasinormal modes and Regge poles) of black holes in Nariai and Schwarzschild spacetimes, revealing smooth spectral deformations, resonance migrations, and non-linear instabilities in weak perturbation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental questions about linear and non-linear spectral stability of black hole spacetimes when subjected to perturbations from nearby compact objects or accretion disks.

Method: Examined the effects of weak and strong localized delta-function perturbations on spherically-symmetric systems (Nariai with Poschl-Teller potential and Schwarzschild spacetime) using a dynamical systems approach, tracking resonance trajectories in the complex plane.

Result: Resonances deform smoothly as perturbations vary; strong perturbations cause resonances to migrate toward attracting hard-wall points, while weak perturbations show non-linear instability due to repelling points near original resonances.

Conclusion: The spectral response to perturbations is governed by competing attracting/repelling spectral points whose trajectories depend on perturbation strength and position, indicating non-linear spectral instability in weak-perturbation cases.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to improve understanding of the resonant spectra of black holes under perturbations arising from e.g. compact objects or accretion disks in their vicinity. It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates first- and second-order Fermi acceleration within frameworks that include generalized Lorentz symmetry deformations (via κ-Poincaré algebra in bicrossproduct and classical bases) and explicit Lorentz violation, comparing these against standard special relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how modified Lorentz symmetries, such as those from κ-Poincaré models, affect particle acceleration mechanisms and energy outcomes compared to conventional relativistic physics.

Method: Developed models for Fermi acceleration using frame transformations, dispersion relations, and conservation laws. Analyzed κ-Poincaré deformations in both bicrossproduct (deforming dispersion) and classical (preserving dispersion) bases, alongside explicit Lorentz violations.

Result: Demonstrated distinct behaviors in particle acceleration depending on the Lorentz deformation type (bicrossproduct vs. classical bases) and explicit violation scenarios. Quantified differences in acceleration efficiency and energy limits relative to standard relativity.

Conclusion: κ-Poincaré-based deformations significantly impact Fermi acceleration processes, suggesting observable differences in high-energy astrophysical contexts where modified relativity may be tested experimentally.

Abstract: We construct models for first- and second-order Fermi acceleration of particles, incorporating generic frame transformations, dispersion relations, and conservation laws. Within this framework, we study deformations of Lorentz symmetry via the $κ$-Poincaré algebra in the bicrossproduct and classical bases, which respectively deform and preserve the relativistic dispersion relation. We also examine explicit Lorentz symmetry violation and compare the results with deformed relativity and special relativity.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the optical properties of charged black holes in f(R) gravity combined with Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics, showing how parameters like charge and fR0 affect light paths, shadow regions, and black hole evaporation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of f(R) gravity and nonlinear electromagnetism on black hole optics, validate theoretical models with M87* observations, and explore black hole evaporation dynamics.

Method: Analyzes photon trajectories in charged black hole spacetimes under f(R) gravity and EH-NLS theory, constrains model parameters using EHT data of M87*, and evaluates energy emission rates for different parameter settings.

Result: Viable parameter regions expand with higher charge and fR0; de Sitter solutions match observations while AdS are disfavored for low charge/fR0 > -1; charge accelerates evaporation, while nonlinearity and fR0 slow it.

Conclusion: Charged black holes in f(R) gravity with EH-NLS exhibit observable optical features compatible with EHT data for certain parameter ranges, offering insights into gravitational-electromagnetic interactions and black hole physics.

Abstract: This work investigates the optical properties of a static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole in f(R) gravity coupled to Euler-Heisenberg(EH) nonlinear electrodynamics(NLED). By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.

*Paul M. Saffin,Qi-Xin Xie*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores quantum properties of boson stars using semiclassical gravity, revealing that strong curvature drives quantum effects, leading to significant quantum fluctuations in the stress tensor and necessitating modifications to classical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate quantum effects in boson stars, which have been less studied compared to their classical counterparts, and understand how quantum corrections influence their spacetime structure.

Method: Computed quantum scalar fields and stress tensor via semiclassical gravity framework, using Pauli-Villars regularization and spectral methods for numerical solutions, with coherent states to compare classical and quantum components.

Result: Quantum energy density is largely positive while radial pressure is negative; quantum fluctuations become significant in high-curvature regions, indicating necessary modifications to classical boson star models.

Conclusion: Quantum effects must be incorporated into classical models of boson stars, and the methods can be applied to other compact objects to study quantum-induced spacetime modifications.

Abstract: Boson stars have been extensively studied in classical gravity, but their quantum properties remain comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections.

*Christian F. Schmidt,Stefan Floerchinger*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper develops a quantum field theory for the U(1) Goldstone boson in a Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent interactions, mapping it to a relativistic theory on a dispersive spacetime. It explores particle production analogs of cosmological scenarios, finding scale-invariant spectra with Transplanckian damping effects that restore scale-invariance at high energies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study non-adiabatic transitions and cosmological particle production in analog models using quantum-simulated Bose-Einstein condensates, addressing the effects of time-dependent scattering lengths and healing lengths interpreted as analog Planck scales.

Method: The authors extend Bogoliubov theory beyond the acoustic approximation, derive an effective action mapping to a dispersive (rainbow) spacetime with Corley-Jacobson-like dispersion. They analyze exponential expansion/power-law contraction in (2+1)D spacetimes, calculing power spectra and damping effects.

Result: Identified Transplanckian damping violations of scale-invariance when cutoff and horizon scales are not separated. For exponential expansion, a new scale-invariant plateau emerges in the UV regime due to suppressed non-adiabatic transitions. This framework improves predictability for analog cosmological experiments.

Conclusion: The approach provides a controllable laboratory system to test cosmological phenomena, enabling the exploration of ultraviolet physics in analog models with potential observation of scale-invariant spectra.

Abstract: The quantum-field-theoretic description for the U(1)-Goldstone boson of a scalar Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent contact interactions is developed beyond the acoustic approximation in accordance with Bogoliubov theory. The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory.

### [53] [A new code for computing differentially rotating neutron stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05176)
*Samuel D. Tootle,Terrence Pierre Jacques,Marie Cassing*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces FUKA, a new suite of codes for creating high-accuracy, axisymmetric models of differentially rotating neutron stars in full general relativity. It uses spectral methods with quasi-isotropic and XCTS coordinate systems, supports 3D equations of state, and validates against existing codes. Future extensions include magnetic fields and binaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop advanced initial data codes that accurately model rotating neutron stars under general relativity, enabling study of differential rotation, critical thresholds, and preparing for future astrophysical simulations involving magnetic fields and binaries.

Method: FUKA employs KADATH's spectral methods with two solvers: quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in spherical and XCTS in Cartesian systems. It uses the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu rotation law but allows extension. GRHayLEOS supports tabulated equations of state in stellar collapse format.

Result: Convergence tests show spectral accuracy. QIC/XCTS solutions match literature models and RNS code. Resolution impact on dynamical simulations was analyzed, confirming convergence order. Errors are tied to evolution scheme limitations.

Conclusion: FUKA provides reliable tools for neutron star modeling, validated against benchmarks. Its public release supports community research in evolving neutron star systems and lays groundwork for future extensions like magnetic fields and binary configurations.

Abstract: We present new initial data codes for constructing stationary, axisymmetric equilibrium models of differentially rotating neutron stars in full general relativity within the Frankfurt University/KADATH (FUKA) suite of initial data codes. FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars.

### [54] [The End of the Road for Bulk Fields in Braneworlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05190)
*G. Alencar,R. S. Almeida,R. N. Costa Filho,T. M. Crispim,Francisco S. N. Lobo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper generalizes local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld models across all dimensions. It finds specific valid models like scalar fields and $b\sqrt{F}$ nonlinear electrodynamics, while excluding Maxwell, p-forms (except 0-form), and Dirac fermions, showing these constraints are universal irrespective of geometry or warp factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous braneworld studies beyond specific dimensions or geometries, establishing dimension-independent criteria to determine which fields can consistently localize in the bulk without relying on particular setups.

Method: Derive local consistency conditions using a framework agnostic to spacetime dimensions and internal geometries. Analyze free scalar fields, Maxwell fields with/without minimal coupling, nonlinear electrodynamics models, and p-form fermions against these conditions.

Result: Scalar fields are consistent; Maxwell fields violate conditions (leading to a no-go theorem). Only $L(F)=b\sqrt{F}$ nonlinear model allows a valid zero mode. Free 0-form is the sole consistent p-form. Dirac fermions cannot localize regardless of Yukawa terms.

Conclusion: Local consistency criteria reveal universal constraints on bulk field localization, superseding results tied to specific geometries or warp factors. This work establishes foundational limitations on possible braneworld field configurations.

Abstract: In this manuscript we generalize Ref. [1] and derive a complete set of local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld scenarios with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here.

### [55] [Towards a unified quantum field theory of dark energy and inflation: unstable de Sitter vacuum and running vacuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05218)
*Joan Solà Peracaula,Àlex González-Fuentes,Cristian Moreno-Pulido*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified quantum field theory (QFT) approach using the Running Vacuum Model (RVM) to explain both inflation and dark energy without an inflaton field, driven by vacuum energy density dependent on the Hubble rate and its derivatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of the standard cosmological model and the reliance on an inflaton scalar field, and to provide a more natural explanation for inflation and dark energy through dynamical vacuum energy.

Method: Analyzes the RVM framework where vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate H and its derivatives. Studies the transition from de Sitter vacuum decay to FLRW radiation epoch and compares dynamics with RVM-inflation scenarios.

Result: Shows that H^4 terms drive inflation, with H^2 terms enabling a graceful exit to radiation domination. The model unifies inflation and dark energy as dynamical VED, with potential observable effects to resolve cosmological tensions.

Conclusion: The RVM framework offers a QFT-based alternative to inflaton-driven inflation, resolving early and late universe issues within a single model with testable implications.

Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $ρ_{\rm vac}=ρ_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $Λ$). In the FLRW epoch, $ρ_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $Λ\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $δρ_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.

### [56] [Constants of motion in gravitational self-force theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05223)
*David Trestini,Zachary Nasipak,Adam Pound*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes using constants of motion (energy, angular momentum, actions) from self-force theory to enhance comparisons and hybridizations between different approaches to the gravitational two-body problem, particularly for nonspinning binaries. Numerical and analytical calculations up to 9PN confirm consistency with existing 4PN post-Newtonian results, and identify perturbed locations of circular orbits and the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional comparisons between self-force theory and other methods rely on gauge-invariant observables tied to orbital frequencies, which can be limiting. The authors seek a more straightforward framework by leveraging constants of motion directly, enabling improved parameter space analysis, hybridizations between methods, and efficient waveform generation using flux-balance laws.

Method: The study numerically and analytically computes constants of motion (energy, azimuthal angular momentum, radial/polar actions) and frequency corrections for nonspinning binaries under first-order self-force. Analytical calculations reach 9PN order, while numerical results validate consistency with 4PN post-Newtonian data. Special parameter space curves (circular orbits, separatrix) are identified using these computed constants.

Result: Consistency between 9PN analytical and numerical results is established, aligning with available 4PN post-Newtonian theory. The perturbed locations of circular orbits and the separatrix between bound/plunging orbits are successfully determined through the proposed framework.

Conclusion: Directly employing self-force constants of motion provides a robust method for integrating different gravitational two-body approaches, improving accuracy in waveform modeling and parameter space analysis. This approach offers computational advantages over frequency-based methods and paves the way for higher-order calculations in nonspinning and potentially spinning systems.

Abstract: Synergies between self-force theory and other approaches to the gravitational two-body problem have traditionally relied on calculations of gauge-invariant observables as functions of orbital frequencies. However, in self-force theory one can also define a complete set of constants of motion: energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory. We also apply the results to identify the perturbed locations of special curves in the parameter space: circular orbits and the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits.
