### [1] [The propagation of long GRB jets through and beyond its progenitor star](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00079)
*Gerardo Urrutia,Agnieszka Janiuk*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines how magnetic fields influence the formation and propagation of long gamma-ray burst jets using GRMHD simulations across different progenitor scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the complex physics of lGRB progenitor environments, particularly how magnetic flux affects jet launching and propagation from the black hole to beyond the progenitor star, which is difficult to model with current simulations.

Method: The authors performed 2.5D GRMHD simulations with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to model jets from lGRB progenitors under three scenarios: highly magnetized, weakly magnetized, and non-magnetized pre-collapse stars.

Result: The simulations revealed distinct behaviors in jet dynamics depending on initial magnetic field strength, providing insights into how magnetic fields regulate energy extraction from the accretion disk and structure formation in jets, with implications for observed lGRB properties.

Conclusion: Magnetic fields play a critical role in jet launch and collimation for lGRBs. The multi-scale approach clarifies how progenitor magnetic configurations influence jet characteristics, offering testable predictions for observational studies.

Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (lGRB) are produced by relativistic jets arising from the collapse of massive stars. Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor. We present highly magnetized, weakly magnetized, and non-magnetized pre-collapse stars, and discuss the observational implications for lGRB jets.

TL;DR: Analyzing EHT images of M87* black hole, the study finds that brightness asymmetry in GRMHD models with strong magnetization (MAD) slightly disfavors low spin values (|a*| ≤ 0.2), supporting the Blandford-Znajek jet model. Future observations could refine spin constraints and clarify jet mechanisms/black hole evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The asymmetric brightness in EHT images of M87* needs explanation, and comparing observed asymmetry to GRMHD models could constrain black hole spin and validate jet-launching theories like Blandford-Znajek.

Method: Compare observed brightness asymmetry distributions from three EHT epochs with GRMHD simulations across varying spin parameters (a*), focusing on strongly magnetized MAD models.

Result: Data marginally disfavors low spin values (|a*| ≤ 0.2) in MAD models, aligning with predictions of nonzero spin for jet activity. Future observations could enhance spin constraint precision.

Conclusion: Spin constraints from asymmetry fluctuations provide insights into jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth. Improved future data will better distinguish between theoretical models.

Abstract: Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black hole M87* depict an asymmetric ring of emission. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios.

### [3] [The Double-Peaked Calcium-Strong SN 2025coe: Progenitor Constraints from Early Interaction and Ejecta Asymmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00415)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: SN 2025coe, the third-closest CaST transient discovered 34 kpc from its host galaxy NGC 3277, shows two light peaks. The first peak results from shock interaction with a compact envelope or CSM, while the second is powered by Ni-56 decay. Spectral analysis suggests either a low-mass He-core collapse or a He-C/O WD merger. The offset and low ejecta mass favor the latter scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate SN 2025coe's unusual properties—proximity, large offset, and dual light peaks—to understand its progenitor system and explosion mechanism.

Method: Multiband photometry tracking two light peaks, bolometric light curve modeling (shock cooling/CSM interaction), and nebular-phase spectral line (Ca II, O I) modeling via explosion simulations. Consider competing scenarios: core-collapse vs. white dwarf merger.

Result: First peak explains via envelope-CSM interaction; second from Ni-56 decay. Line profiles fit asymmetric He-core collapse, but ejecta mass and low star formation support WD merger. Both scenarios remain viable.

Conclusion: SN 2025coe exemplifies CaST transients' diversity. Its origin remains ambiguous between core-collapse and merger, highlighting the need for further study on progenitor environments and explosion models.

Abstract: Supernova (SN) 2025coe at a distance of $\sim$25 Mpc is the third-closest calcium-strong (CaST) transient. It was discovered at a large projected offset of $\sim$34 kpc from its potential host galaxy NGC 3277. Multiband photometry of SN 2025coe indicates the presence of two peaks at day $\sim$2 and day $\sim$11 after explosion. Modeling the bolometric light curve, we find that the first peak can be reproduced either by shock cooling of a compact envelope ($R_\mathrm{env}$ $\approx $6-40 $R_{\odot}$; $M_\mathrm{env}$ $\approx $0.1-0.2 $M_{\odot}$) or by interaction with close-in circumstellar material (CSM; $R_{\mathrm{CSM}} \lesssim 8 \times10^{14}$ cm), or a combination of both. The second peak is dominated by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni ($M_{\mathrm{ej}} \approx $0.4-0.5 $M_{\odot}$; $M_{^{56}\mathrm{Ni}} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-2}$ $M_{\odot}$). SN 2025coe rapidly evolves from the photospheric phase dominated by He I P-Cygni profiles to nebular phase spectra dominated by strong [Ca II] $λλ$7291, 7323 and weak [O I] $λλ$6300, 6364 emission lines. Simultaneous line profile modeling of [Ca II] and [O I] at nebular phases shows that an asymmetric core-collapse explosion of a low-mass ($\lesssim$3.3 $M_{\odot}$) He-core progenitor can explain the observed line profiles. Alternatively, lack of local star formation at the site of the SN explosion combined with a low ejecta mass is also consistent with a thermonuclear explosion due to a low-mass hybrid He-C/O white dwarf + C/O white dwarf merger.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Magnetar flares are highly energetic and rare events where intense high-energy emission is released from strongly magnetised neutron stars. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.

### [5] [Discovering pulsars in compact binaries with a hidden Markov model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00500)
*Joseph O'Leary,Liam Dunn,Andrew Melatos*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new, fast semi-coherent detection method using a hidden Markov model (HMM) combined with the Schuster periodogram to identify radio pulsars in compact binaries with orbital periods as short as 0.012 days, improving computational efficiency under various observational conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discovering radio pulsars in compact binaries with short orbital periods (P_b ≲ 1 day) is computationally challenging due to strong Doppler modulation of their pulse frequencies, which traditional acceleration searches struggle to handle effectively.

Method: The method employs a hidden Markov model (HMM) integrated with a maximum likelihood matched filter (Schuster periodogram). It splits the time-dependent pulse frequency into piecewise-constant blocks and uses dynamic programming (Viterbi algorithm) to track frequency evolution efficiently.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate detection capability for binaries with flux densities ≥0.50 mJy and orbital periods ≥0.012 days, performing robustly under typical survey conditions, including interference. The runtime scales predictably with parameters like subbands, segments, and frequency bins.

Conclusion: The proposed HMM-based approach offers a computationally efficient and reliable alternative to traditional methods, significantly expanding the detection potential for short-period compact binaries in radio pulsar surveys.

Abstract: Discovering radio pulsars in compact binaries, whose orbital periods $P_{\rm b}$ satisfy $P_{\rm b} \lesssim 1 \, \rm{day}$, is computationally challenging, because the time-dependent pulse frequency $f_{\rm p}(t)$ is strongly Doppler modulated by the binary motion. Here we present a new, fast, semi-coherent detection scheme based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) combined with a maximum likelihood matched filter, the Schuster periodogram. The HMM scheme complements traditional acceleration searches by dividing $f_{\rm p}(t)$ into piecewise-constant blocks and tracking the block-to-block evolution efficiently using dynamic programming. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new method can detect compact binaries with flux densities $S \geq 0.50 \, \rm{mJy}$ and orbital periods $P_{\rm b} \geq 0.012 \, \rm{day}$ under observing conditions (e.g.\ cadence) typical of radio pulsar surveys, with and without impulsive, narrowband radio frequency interference. The new method is fast; it employs the classic Viterbi algorithm to solve the HMM recursively. The central processing unit run time scales nominally as $T_{\rm run} \approx 2.8 \, N_B (N_T/10^2) (N_Q \ln N_Q/10^4 \ln 10^4) \, {\rm s}$ for $N_B$ subbands, $N_T$ coherent segments, and $N_Q$ frequency bins.

### [6] [High-energy Emission from Turbulent Electron-ion Coronae of Accreting Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00518)
*Daniel Groselj,Alexander Philippov,Andrei M. Beloborodov,Richard Mushotzky*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a model of particle energization and emission in turbulent black-hole coronae using 2D radiative PIC simulations, explaining observed X-ray spectra like those in NGC 4151, and predicts MeV photon tails from nonthermal electrons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind nonthermal ion distributions and X-ray emission from black-hole coronae, particularly addressing how turbulence influences particle energization and spectral observations.

Method: Employed 2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations with electron-ion plasma, photon injection/escape, Compton scattering, and turbulence effects to model corona dynamics.

Result: Simulations reproduce observed X-ray spectra (e.g., NGC 4151), reveal MeV photon tails from accelerated electrons, and show coronal self-regulation into a two-temperature state where ions (heated via shocks and reconnection) carry 60-70% of dissipated energy.

Conclusion: Turbulent coronae efficiently energize ions and electrons through shocks/reconnection, producing observable X-ray features and MeV signatures, advancing explanations of active galactic nucleus emissions.

Abstract: We develop a model of particle energization and emission from strongly turbulent black-hole coronae. Our local model is based on a set of 2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations with an electron-ion plasma composition, injection and diffusive escape of photons and charged particles, and self-consistent Compton scattering. We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow.

### [7] [Spectral Shapes of Pair Annihilation Line Emission in Magnetar Giant Flares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00666)
*Tomoki Wada,Shigeo S. Kimura*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explores MeV gamma-ray spectra from electron-positron pair annihilation in magnetar giant flares (MGFs), showing relativistic beaming broadens the feature into a power-law spectrum. Simulations indicate baryon-poor fireballs enhance detectability, and upcoming satellites could observe ~100 photons from Galactic MGFs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the MeV gamma-ray line detection in GRB 221009A, the work aims to understand similar signatures in MGFs to confirm pair annihilation origins and constraints on fireball properties.

Method: An analytic model derived for line emission accounting for relativistic beaming effects, followed by Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations including pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence on baryon loading was parametrized and tested.

Result: Relativistic beaming produces a -1 photon index power-law feature. Baryon-poor environments are optimal for MeV emission detection. Current instruments like Fermi/GBM can observe initial MGF spikes, while future satellites could detect ~100 photons from these events.

Conclusion: Detection of power-law MeV features in MGFs would validate pair annihilation mechanisms and offer insights into progenitor environments. Upcoming missions are crucial for confirming these theoretical predictions.

Abstract: We investigate the gamma-ray spectrum in the MeV range arising from electron-positron pair annihilation in fireballs associated with magnetar giant flares (MGFs), motivated by the recent observation of a MeV gamma-ray line feature in a bright gamma-ray burst, GRB~221009A. We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events.

### [8] [Hadronic Origin of Sub-PeV Gamma-Ray Emission from LHAASO J0621+3755](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00692)
*Sonali Sahoo,Ankan Roy,Kritika Yadav,Reetanjali Moharana*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines whether proton-proton interactions in a superdiffusion environment could explain the sub-PeV gamma rays observed from the pulsar PSR J0622+3749’s halo, requiring CR proton luminosity at 10% of the pulsar's spin-down luminosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if hadronic processes (proton-proton interactions) can account for the observed gamma rays, contrasting previous leptonic models relying on electron inverse Compton scattering.

Method: Investigated proton propagation in a one-zone superdiffusion model (α=1) with ambient gas density 1 cm⁻³, calculating CR proton luminosity needed to match observed gamma energies (~4 TeV to 200 TeV).

Result: Requires CR proton luminosity η_p ~0.1 of the pulsar's spin-down luminosity, suggesting hadronic channels are viable but less dominant than leptonic models.

Conclusion: While proton-proton interactions could contribute to gamma-ray production in pulsar halos, leptonic mechanisms remain favored unless hadronic efficiency improves.

Abstract: Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays are primarily estimated to arise from high-energy electromagnetic interactions in pulsars and their halo through electron inverse Compton (IC) scattering. Hadronic channels like neutral pion decay have also been proposed to produce TeV-PeV gamma rays from the Pulsar halo. The neutral pions are expected to be generated from cosmic ray (CR) protons interacting with the ambient/cloud. The recent observations of sub-PeV gamma rays from the halo of pulsar PSR J0622+3749 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory Kilometre-Square Array (LHAASO-KM2A) detector provide a platform to explore different channels of their production. Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $η_p\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity. In this case, we have considered the protons propagating in a one-zone superdiffusion environment, specifically $α= 1$ in a cloud of gas density 1 per cm$^{3}$.

### [9] [Eccentric Disks from Circumbinary Rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00741)
*Leonardo Betancourt,Andrew MacFadyen,Jonathan Zrake*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper uses simulations to study how gaseous circumbinary rings (CBRs) evolve under binary stars, finding that cold gas suppresses accretion onto the binary and results in disks with higher eccentricities. The dynamics produce spectral features and suggest possible UV/X-ray emission from shocked gas, with implications for quasar variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the behavior of CBRs around binary systems and their impact on accretion mechanics and observational signatures like quasar light curves and emission lines.

Method: High-resolution grid-based hydrodynamics simulations of finite gaseous CBRs undergoing viscous spreading into circumbinary disks.

Result: Cold CBRs suppress accretion, create eccentric disks (up to e~0.3), and exhibit spectral peaks at ~0.1Ω_b. Stream shocks may produce quasi-periodic UV/soft X-ray eruptions from binaries. Compact CBR progenitors are needed for disk asymmetry in emission lines.

Conclusion: CBRs evolving into eccentric disks explain certain astrophysical phenomena like quasar variability and double-peaked emission lines, offering insights into black hole binary systems and their observational signatures.

Abstract: We perform high-resolution, grid-based hydrodynamics simulations of finite gaseous circumbinary rings (CBRs) viscously spreading into disks around binaries. We find that all systems suppress accretion onto the binary when the gas is relatively cold. CBRs display weak variability above the binary orbital frequency $Ω_b$ and a dominant, robust spectral peak at $\sim0.1Ω_b$ (half the fiducial lump frequency of $\sim0.2Ω_b$). Smaller rings relax into disks with enhanced gas eccentricity up to $e\simeq 0.3$. We consider the possibility that inefficiently-accreting, intermediate-mass ($\sim10^4 M_\odot$) black hole binaries may be sources of quasi-periodic eruptions when rejected streams shock the cavity wall and radiate in the UV or soft X-ray. We discuss the implications of eccentric disks evolved from CBRs for quasar light curves and asymmetric, time-variable double-peaked line emission from disks in galactic nuclei. If binaries drive asymmetry in accretion disk line profiles, our study suggests that the progenitor CBR must have been very compact.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study presents XRISM/Resolve observations of NGC 1365, revealing Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption and emission lines during a low-flux state, indicating a photoionized wind or shocked gas. The findings link the X-ray-emitting region to the optical/IR broad-line region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate rapid accretion disk state transitions in NGC 1365 and explore the origin of absorbing/emission features in its X-ray spectrum.

Method: Performed XRISM/Resolve observations in February and July 2024, analyzed Fe Kα line broadening, compared spectral features with Hβ and Paα line profiles, and modeled wind-launch radii using ionization states.

Result: Detected persistent low-flux state with Fe absorption/emission lines, resolved Fe Kα line broadenings (~1300 km/s), and identified similarities in X-ray emission and optical/IR line profiles, suggesting shared origin.

Conclusion: X-ray emission regions are cospatial with optical/IR broad-line regions, likely part of a unified structure driven by accretion disk winds or shocks in the interstellar medium.

Abstract: We present the first XRISM/Resolve observations of the active galactic nucleus, NGC 1365, obtained in 2024 February and July. NGC 1365 is known for rapid transitions between Compton-thick and Compton-thin states, along with strong absorption from a highly ionized wind. During our observations, the source is found in a persistent low-flux state, characterized by a decrease in hard-X-ray luminosity and significant line-of-sight obscuration. In this state, XRISM/Resolve reveals clear Fe\,\textsc{xxv} and Fe\,\textsc{xxvi} absorption lines together with, for the first time in this source, corresponding emission lines. These features may arise either from reemission from a photoionized wind (P Cygni profile) or from collisionally ionized gas associated with outflow-driven shocks in the interstellar medium. We estimate the wind launch radius to be approximately $10^{16}~\mathrm{cm}$ ($\sim 10^4 R_{\mathrm{g}}$), consistent with the location of the X-ray broad-line region. We also resolve a broadened Fe K$α$ line by $σ\sim 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ placing it at similar scales to the wind, consistent with radii inferred from disk-broadening models and the variability of the Fe K$α$ broad line. The similarity of the Fe K$α$ profile to the H$β$ wing and broad Pa$α$ width indicates that the X-ray-emitting region is likely cospatial with the optical/IR broad-line region and originates from the same gas.

*Yujin Kim*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The proliferation of LEO satellites introduces variable RFI challenging radio astronomy. This paper examines low rank methods' limits in single epoch observations, showing that strong interference leads to signal loss, necessitating new mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of variable satellite RFI on radio astronomy, especially when only single epoch data is available, and determine the effectiveness and limits of low rank decomposition in mitigating such interference.

Method: Formulated satellite interference as a structured non-stationary component mixed with astrophysical signals and noise. Used simulations and empirical analysis to evaluate low rank decomposition's performance under varying interference strengths, quantifying signal preservation and interference suppression.

Result: Aggressive rank truncation causes distortion in low SNR astrophysical features. Beyond a critical interference strength, low rank methods induce irreversible information loss, showing operational boundaries for such techniques.

Conclusion: Low rank methods have limited effectiveness against strong satellite RFI in single epoch data. Future work requires interference-aware, data-driven strategies tailored for this regime.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has introduced a new class of radio frequency interference (RFI) that poses a fundamental challenge to modern radio astronomy. In particular, unintended electromagnetic radiation emitted by satellite electronics exhibits strong temporal variability and weak spectral regularity, limiting the effectiveness of conventional mitigation techniques that rely on long term averaging or multi epoch observations. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of low rank interference mitigation in the single epoch regime, where only a single time frequency snapshot is available. We formulate satellite induced interference as a structured but non stationary component superposed on astrophysical signals and thermal noise, and analyze the conditions under which low rank decomposition can successfully suppress interference while preserving underlying astronomical information. Through controlled simulations and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that aggressive rank truncation can lead to substantial signal distortion, particularly for diffuse or low signal to noise astrophysical features. We quantify this trade off using preservation and suppression metrics, and show that beyond a critical interference strength, low rank methods inevitably induce irreversible information loss. Our results clarify the operational boundaries of low rank approaches for next generation radio observations and highlight the need for interference aware, data driven mitigation strategies tailored to the single epoch regime.

### [12] [Light-tight skipper-CCDs for X-ray detection in space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00127)
*Ana M. Botti,Yikai Wu,Brenda Cervantes,Claudio Chavez,Juan Estrada,Stephen E. Holland,Nathan Saffold,Javier Tiffenberg,Sho Uemura*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents a light-tight aluminum shield for Skipper-CCDs to suppress optical/near-IR light while maintaining X-ray detection efficiency, demonstrating >99.6% light suppression with no efficiency loss for certain X-ray energies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical and near-infrared photons can saturate Skipper-CCDs, distorting X-ray signals. This motivates the need for a shielding solution that blocks optical light without affecting X-ray detection.

Method: The authors deposited aluminum layers (50-100nm) on CCD surfaces using e-beam evaporation. They tested light suppression (650-1000 nm) with a monochromator, X-ray transmission with a 55Fe source, and extended results via Geant4 simulations for broader energy ranges.

Result: 50/100nm aluminum coatings achieved >99.6% optical suppression with no efficiency loss for 5.9/6.4 keV X-rays. Simulations confirmed effectiveness across energy ranges, showing thin aluminum is a practical solution.

Conclusion: Thin aluminum coatings are an effective, low-cost method to shield Skipper-CCDs from optical backgrounds while preserving X-ray detection capabilities, suitable for space-based astronomy.

Abstract: Skipper Charge-Coupled Devices (skipper-CCDs) are pixelated silicon detectors with deep sub-electron resolution. Their radiation hardness and capability to reconstruct energy deposits with unprecedented precision make them a promising technology for space-based X-ray astronomy. In this scenario, optical and near-infrared photons may saturate the sensor, distorting the reconstructed signal. We present a light-tight shield for skipper-CCDs to suppress optical backgrounds while preserving X-ray detection efficiency. We deposited thin aluminum layers on the CCD surface using an e-beam evaporator and evaluated their blinding performance across wavelengths from 650 to 1000 nm using a monochromator, as well as the X-ray transmission using an $^{55}$Fe source. We find that 50 and 100\,nm layers provide >99.6\% light suppression, with no efficiency loss for 5.9 and 6.4\,keV X-rays. In addition, we used Geant4 simulations to extend these results to a broader energy range and quantify the efficiency loss for different aluminum thicknesses. Results show that thin aluminum coatings are an effective, low-cost solution for optical suppression in skipper-CCDs intended for X-ray detection and space instrumentation.

### [13] [Combining datasets with different ground truths using Low-Rank Adaptation to generalize image-based CNN models for photometric redshift prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00146)
*Vikram Seenivasan,Srinath Saikrishnan,Andrew Lizarraga,Jonathan Soriano,Bernie Boscoe,Tuan Do*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper shows that Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) effectively combines photometric and spectroscopic datasets to improve CNN-based galaxy redshift estimation, achieving better accuracy than traditional transfer learning with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric datasets are abundant but less accurate for redshifts, while spectroscopic data is more precise but scarce. The goal is to combine their strengths to build more accurate models without full retraining.

Method: A base model is trained on photometric data, then fine-tuned with LoRA using spectroscopic data. This approach is compared to traditional transfer learning and full retraining on combined datasets.

Result: The LoRA method reduces bias and scatter by ~2.5× and ~2.2× respectively compared to traditional transfer learning. While full retraining performs better, it requires significantly more computation.

Conclusion: LoRA offers a computationally efficient middle ground for adapting pretrained models in data-scarce astrophysical tasks like redshift estimation, enabling better generalization without full retraining.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can be used to combine different galaxy imaging datasets to improve redshift estimation with CNN models for cosmology. LoRA is an established technique for large language models that adds adapter networks to adjust model weights and biases to efficiently fine-tune large base models without retraining. We train a base model using a photometric redshift ground truth dataset, which contains broad galaxy types but is less accurate. We then fine-tune using LoRA on a spectroscopic redshift ground truth dataset. These redshifts are more accurate but limited to bright galaxies and take orders of magnitude more time to obtain, so are less available for large surveys. Ideally, the combination of the two datasets would yield more accurate models that generalize well. The LoRA model performs better than a traditional transfer learning method, with $\sim2.5\times$ less bias and $\sim$2.2$\times$ less scatter. Retraining the model on a combined dataset yields a model that generalizes better than LoRA but at a cost of greater computation time. Our work shows that LoRA is useful for fine-tuning regression models in astrophysics by providing a middle ground between full retraining and no retraining. LoRA shows potential in allowing us to leverage existing pretrained astrophysical models, especially for data sparse tasks.

Abstract: Our Sun is the closest X-ray astrophysical source to Earth. As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.

Abstract: Cloud coverage is one of the crucial elements of site testing in astronomy. All-sky camera (ASC) images are beneficial for our research on cloud coverage. In this paper, we propose ASCNet, an innovative model specifically designed for classifying nighttime ASC images collected at the Muztagh-ata site from 2022 March to 2024 June. ASCNet integrates ResNet34 with an ASCModule, which employs Depthwise Dilated Convolution and embeds lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation attention within its branches to extract fine-grained texture information from the luminance channel. The data set is partitioned by category, with 70% of images assigned to the training set and 30% to the test set. The model's performance is assessed by comparing its predictions on the test set with manually annotated labels, yielding a consistency rate of 92.7%. All evaluation metrics of ASCNet are as follows: Accuracy 92.66%, Precision 83.26%, Recall 84.25%, and F1-Score 83.67%, and both ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate significant superiority over other models. A confusion matrix is utilized to analyze the differences between manual classification and model classification. The statistical results demonstrate the model's excellent classification performance and its robust generalization ability, illustrating that ASCNet has potential for application in future astronomical image classifications.

Abstract: This paper discusses issues encountered during the early development of the instrument on the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), a NASA ASI Small Explorer mission launched on 9 December 2021. IXPE has observed about 100 sources, yielding meaningful polarimetry for most of them. An on-board calibration system mitigated most non-ideal detector behaviors during operations. Data from the on-board polarized and unpolarized X-ray sources are routinely ingested by the flight pipeline to correct the instrument response in a manner transparent to users. Based on its scientific return and payload health, the IXPE mission has been extended through 2028. The lessons learned are informing the design of next-generation X-ray polarimetry missions, as discussed elsewhere in these conferences.

*Martin A. Mojahed,Sascha Weber*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new GeV-scale leptogenesis mechanism within the standard type-I seesaw model that doesn't require CP violation or RHN oscillations, viable even with a single RHN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of standard freeze-in leptogenesis by proposing a mechanism operative at GeV-scale RHN masses that works without CP violation in the RHN sector or multiple RHNs.

Method: Examines a cosmological scenario with electron-positron asymmetry at high temperatures, using the minimal type-I seesaw model with two RHNs to demonstrate mechanism viability without relying on traditional CP violation mechanisms.

Result: Shows successful baryogenesis via this leptogenesis mechanism across large parameter spaces, even without small RHN mass splittings. Challenges conventional requirements for multiple RHNs or CP violation.

Conclusion: GeV-scale leptogenesis offers a testable alternative to standard models, expanding viable parameter regions and reducing dependency on traditional assumptions like multiple RHNs or CP violation in RHN sector.

Abstract: We present an experimentally testable leptogenesis mechanism based on the standard type-I seesaw model that successfully operates at right-handed-neutrino (RHN) masses around the GeV scale. The mechanism takes place in a cosmological background with an asymmetry between right-handed electrons and left-handed positrons generated at high temperatures, and does not require oscillations between RHNs or any CP violation in the RHN sector. In contrast to standard leptogenesis via freeze-in, our mechanism works even in the presence of a single RHN around the GeV scale. The mechanism is illustrated for the minimal type-I seesaw with two RHNs, where we show that successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis is viable in large regions of parameter space even without a small mass splitting between the RHNs.

*Reuven Balkin,Ta'el Coren,Alexander Jentsch,Hongkai Liu,Maksym Ovchynnikov,Yotam Soreq,Sokratis Trifinopoulos*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study evaluates the Electron-Ion Collider's (EIC) ability to detect invisible decays of pseudoscalar particles in coherent exclusive electroproduction, potentially improving sensitivity by four orders of magnitude for mesons like η/η' and probing axion-like particles (ALPs) with specific couplings and masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the EIC's capability to observe rare invisible decay channels of pseudoscalar mesons (π⁰, η/η') and ALPs, which are poorly constrained by current experiments. This addresses gaps in understanding beyond Standard Model physics and dark sector interactions.

Method: Analyze EIC sensitivity using forward proton tagging with reduced energy and minimal detector activity. Emphasize background suppression via precise kinematic reconstruction, exploiting the exclusive nature of the process to identify signal events against hadronic backgrounds.

Result: The EIC could enhance existing bounds on π⁰, η/η' invisible decay branching ratios down to 1e-8 and probe ALPs in the 0.1-2 GeV mass range with coupling strengths up to 1e5 GeV, outperforming current experimental limits.

Conclusion: The EIC represents a transformative tool for probing new physics via invisible decays of pseudoscalar particles, offering unprecedented sensitivity to dark sector interactions and beyond-Standard-Model phenomena.

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to invisible final states in coherent exclusive electroproduction. The characteristic signal is a forward proton with reduced energy and little additional detector activity. Using the excellent particle detection capabilities and kinematics reconstruction at the EIC, we argue that backgrounds can be strongly suppressed. While our analysis applies to various states, we specifically focus on pseudoscalar particles: (i) neutral mesons ($π^0,η^{(\prime)}$), whose invisible Standard Model decays are extremely suppressed, and (ii) gluon-coupled axion-like particles (ALPs) decaying invisibly to a dark sector. Depending on the meson species and the achievable background rejection, the EIC could strengthen existing bounds on invisible decays of pseudoscalar mesons by up to four orders of magnitude, probing branching ratios as small as ${\rm BR}(η^{(\prime)}\to{\rm inv})\sim 10^{-8}$. In addition, the EIC would directly probe invisibly decaying ALPs with the couplings up to $f_a\sim 10^5\,\text{GeV}$ and masses in the range $0.1$-$2\,\text{GeV}$.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study evaluates the potential of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) to discover a new heavy Z' boson predicted by U(1)_{B-L} symmetry through dilepton production channels. It shows FCC-hh can exclude Z' masses up to ~40 TeV for strong couplings and ~15 TeV for weaker ones, using optimized cuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the discovery potential of FCC-hh for a Z' boson in parameter spaces not yet excluded by LHC data, focusing on high-mass regimes inaccessible to current experiments.

Method: Performed full Monte Carlo simulations for various (M_{Z'}, g_{B-L}) scenarios, analyzed dilepton production channel pp→Z'→ll, considered SM backgrounds (Drell-Yan, diboson, top processes), applied kinematic/angular cuts to optimize signal-to-background ratio.

Result: FCC-hh with 3 ab^-1 luminosity can exclude Z' masses up to ~40 TeV (g_{B-L}~1) and ~15 TeV (g_{B-L}~0.1) at 95% CL. Achieved 5σ discovery up to ~30 TeV with optimized cuts.

Conclusion: FCC-hh has strong capability to detect Z' bosons in high-mass regions, advancing BSM physics explorations beyond LHC limits through precise cut optimizations.

Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of the discovery potential at the FCC-hh for a new heavy neutral vector boson, Z', predicted by the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. Focusing on the parameter space currently not excluded by Large Hadron Collider data, we analyze the dilepton production channel $p p \rightarrow Z^{\prime} \rightarrow l^{+} l^{-}$ ($l^{\pm} = e^{\pm}, μ^{\pm}$) at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 100$ TeV. Full Monte Carlo simulations was performed for different ($M_{Z'}$, $g_{B-L}$) BSM scenarios and relevant Standard Model backgrounds (including irreducible Drell-Yan, diboson, single top-quark and top-quark pair productions) identifying optimal kinematic and angular selection cuts to guide future searches for this type resonance. We estimate the FCC-hh reach for an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ = 3~$ab^{-1}$. Our results demonstrate that the FCC-hh can exclude Z' masses up to $\sim 40$ TeV with 95\% C.L. for couplings of $g_{B-L} \sim 1$, and up to $\sim 15$ TeV for $g_{B-L} \sim 0.1$. We find the kinematic and angular cuts that optimize the signal over background ratio and achieve a $5σ$ signal up to Z' masses of $\sim 30$ TeV. These findings highlight the FCC-hh potential to uncover new physics signals in the high-mass regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Doubly charged scalars are common in Standard Model extensions explaining neutrino masses, and their distinct signatures make them viable for experimental detection.

Method: Analyzed LHC Run II data and simulated FCC-hh scenarios to detect doubly charged scalars via photon-photon fusion, considering both lepton-flavor conserving and violating decay modes.

Result: FCC-hh at 100 TeV can probe masses up to 7 TeV, surpassing LHC capabilities, potentially revealing the mechanism behind neutrino masses.

Conclusion: FCC-hh is crucial for exploring heavy doubly charged scalars, offering insights into beyond-Standard-Model physics and neutrino mass origins.

Abstract: Doubly charged scalars frequently emerge in many well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model, particularly in frameworks that aim to explain the origin of neutrino masses. Their distinct electric charge and clean leptonic signatures make them especially compelling from the standpoint of experimental searches. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of the LHC full run II, including photon-photon fusion, and Future Circular Collider in its hadron-hadron configuration (FCC-hh) to such states, assuming they decay promptly and exclusively into charged leptons either conserving or violating lepton flavor. We find that the FCC-hh, operating at 100 TeV, is uniquely positioned to probe doubly charged scalars with masses up to 7 TeV and possibly establish the mechanism behind neutrino masses.

Motivation: To explore multiboson interactions involving the Higgs boson as a probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model in the electroweak sector.

Result: Estimated significance of 0.63σ for WHγ production with 440 fb⁻¹ integrated luminosity, projected 1.64σ significance at High-Luminosity LHC.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of WHγ channel to probe electroweak interactions and the need for higher luminosity to detect possible new physics effects.

Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics, though remarkably successful, leaves open several major questions that continue to motivate searches for new phenomena. Multiboson interactions involving the Higgs boson are of special interest as probes of the electroweak Lagrangian where potential new physics may be hiding. In this work, we present a study of the simultaneous production of a W boson, a Higgs bosons and a photon in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to model both the signal and the background processes, and detector effects are included according to CMS specifications. Boosted decision trees are employed to optimize the event selection and enhance signal-background discrimination. We estimate that with an integrated luminosity of 440~$\rm fb^{-1}$, the expected significance for the $WHγ$ process is 0.63$σ$, projected to reach 1.64$σ$ at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neutrino mixing scheme with a specific mass matrix selection rule using a T' flavor symmetry, combining type-I and II seesaw mechanisms. It predicts precise values for neutrino masses, mixings, and CP-violating phases under both normal and inverted mass orderings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a new neutrino mixing pattern through a constrained mass matrix and symmetry extension, aiming to make testable predictions about neutrino properties and mass orderings.

Method: A T' flavor discrete symmetry is integrated into the Standard Model. The model uses combined type-I and II seesaw mechanisms to generate the neutrino mass matrix with the given selection rule. Predictions are derived for neutrino masses, mixing angles (α₁, α₂), Dirac CP-phase (δ_Dirac), and neutrinoless double beta decay (m_ee).

Result: For normal ordering: α₂ ≈ 2π, lightest mass 3-4e-4 eV, m_ee ≈3e-3 eV. Inverted ordering predicts specific angle ranges (e.g., 110°<α₁<170°, 240° < δ_Dirac < 310°) and a lighter mass range (2e-5-7e-3 eV) for the lightest neutrino.

Conclusion: The model provides stringent predictions testable by future experiments, offering insights into neutrino mass spectra and CP violation through its unique seesaw combination and symmetry framework.

Abstract: The present manuscript studies a recently proposed new neutrino mixing scheme with a neutrino mass selection rule, $m_ν^{13} + m_ν^{22} + m_ν^{31} = 0$, among a neutrino mass matrix elements. The neutrino mass matrix texture is achieved by means of $T^{\prime}$ flavor discrete symmetry extension of the Standard Model gauge group. The model realizing the neutrino mixing pattern consists of a combination of type-I and II seesaw mechanisms in the minimal possible extension of the Standard Model. Stringent predictions are obtained for normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. Some important predictions include $α_2 \approx 2π$ (best fit), $m_{\text{lightest}} \approx 3 - 4 \times 10^{-4}\,\text{eV}$, and $m_{ee}^{0νββ} \approx 3 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}$ for normal neutrino mass ordering; $110^\circ < α_1 < 170^\circ$, $40(220)^\circ < α_2 < 60(240)^\circ$, $240^\circ < δ_{\text{Dirac}} < 310^\circ$, and $m_{\text{lightest}} \approx 2 \times 10^{-5} - 7 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}$ for inverted neutrino mass ordering.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the detailed spectrum of high-frequency gravitational waves produced during and after inflation, demonstrating that the full spectrum's connection between low and high frequencies can differentiate inflation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how gravitational waves produced post-inflation during inflaton oscillations contribute to the stochastic background and how the extended spectrum can help distinguish inflationary models.

Method: Detailed calculation of gravitational wave spectra both during/after inflation, considering inflaton dynamics post-inflation to model high-frequency components and their connection to low-frequency regimes.

Result: The spectrum extends to higher frequencies than previously acknowledged, showing distinctive features that depend on inflation model parameters, enabling potential observational discrimination between models.

Conclusion: High-frequency gravitational wave spectra provide a new observational handle to test inflationary models, as their detailed shape carries unique signatures of the early universe's dynamics.

Abstract: During inflation gravitational waves are produced in the superhorizon regime, which form stochastic background in the present universe with very wide range of frequencies. Higher frequency gravitational waves never experience superhorizon regime, but they are also amplified after inflation due to the inflaton oscillation. Taking account of the inflaton dynamics after inflation, the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves may extend to much higher frequencies than previously thought. In this paper we calculate the spectrum of high frequency gravitational waves produced during and after inflation in detail, in particular focusing on the connection between the low and high frequency regime, and show that the detailed spectrum can distinguish inflation models.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper re-examines the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model, exploring the viability of a right-handed neutrino (RHN) as dark matter through various annihilation processes and production mechanisms. It identifies viable dark matter mass ranges (thermal up to 2000 GeV, non-thermal up to 1000 GeV) and discusses observable signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the minimal scotogenic model can explain neutrino masses and dark matter simultaneously, considering constraints from particle physics experiments and cosmological observations.

Method: Analysis of RHN dark matter relic density considering self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, and freeze-in production. Constraints from direct detection, collider searches, muon g-2, lepton flavor violation, and neutrino oscillations are applied.

Result: The lightest RHN can serve as dark matter in specific mass ranges. Thermal DM requires masses above half the Higgs mass up to 2000 GeV, while non-thermal DM spans 0.1 GeV to 1000 GeV. Displaced vertex signatures suggest future collider detectability.

Conclusion: The scotogenic model successfully reconciles neutrino mass generation and dark matter, with testable predictions for current and upcoming experiments.

Abstract: The scotogeneic neutrino mass models are very popular choices to generate light neutrino masses via radiative mechanism. In these models, the particles running in the loop are distinguished from the standard model due to an imposed $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the loop particles are odd. Therefore, the lightest particle running in the loop can be a viable dark matter candidate. In this paper, we revisit the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model and study the anatomy of right handed neutrino (RHN) DM relic, taking into account contributions from self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, as well as production via the freeze-in mechanism. We impose the constraints from direct detection and collider searches of DM including anomalous magnetic moment of muon, charged lepton flavor violation and low-energy neutrino oscillation data to show that the lightest RHN can be a viable DM in the mass range: $M_{h}/2\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim2000 {\rm GeV}$ (thermal DM) and $0.1 ~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim 1000 {\rm GeV}$ (non-thermal DM), where $M_h$ denotes the Standard Model Higgs mass and $M_{\rm DM}$ is the RHN dark matter mass. We also find the displaced vertex signatures of long lived particles which can be probed at future colliders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the $W^\prime$ boson's role in new physics beyond the Standard Model by analyzing its interactions at electron-proton colliders, particularly in regions where the Standard Model predictions are absent.

Method: Analyze $e^- u \to ν_e d$ and $e^- u \to e^\pm jjj$ processes with $t$-channel $W^\prime$ exchange, quantifying electron polarization effects on cross sections and using lepton angular distributions as key observables.

Result: The $W^\prime$ mass could be detected up to ~10 TeV in certain parameter regions, with coupling precision ~1%. The $e^- u \to e^+ jjj$ process, forbidden in the Standard Model, serves as a unique signature for Left-Right Symmetric Model validation.

Conclusion: Electron-proton colliders offer a promising platform to probe $W^\prime$ interactions through polarization-dependent cross sections and exclusive final states, enhancing our understanding of beyond-Standard-Model physics.

Abstract: As a strong candidate for new physics beyond the Standard Model, the exotic charged gauge boson $W^{\prime}$ has attracted extensive research interest. In this work we investigate the interactions of the $W^{\prime}$ boson at the electron-proton colliders. The process $e^- u \to ν_e d$ and $e^- u \to e^\pm jjj$ with $t$-channel $W^{\prime}$ exchange are studied. The polarization of the initial-state electrons has a significant impact on the cross section of the studied process, while the angular distribution of the final-state leptons serves as an important observable for the interactions of the $W^{\prime}$ boson. In some specific regions of the parameter space, the detectable mass range for the $W^{\prime}$ boson can reach around 10 TeV, and the coupling strength can achieve a precision of approximately 1\% relative to the interaction strength of the Standard Model. Especially, $e^- u \to e^+ jjj$ process is forbidden within the Standard Model, which would constitute important evidence in the search for the Left-Right Symmetric Model.

Abstract: We study the non-leptonic decays of $Ω_{b}\rightarrow Ω_{c} P (V)$ with eight pseudoscalar and vector mesons using the QCD factorization approach. We analyze all relevant topologies (the tree-level, color-suppressed, and penguin) of these decays and calculate the decay amplitude for each separately. We determine the decay rates, branching ratios and compare our results with those from other theoretical predictions. The results obtained may be useful for the analysis of the related data in both ongoing and future experiments.

Abstract: High-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, are genuine quantum machines, so, in line with Richard Feynman's original motivation for Quantum Computing, the scattering processes that take place there are natural candidates to be simulated on a quantum system. Potential applications range from quantum machine learning methods for collider data analysis, to faster and more precise evaluations of intricate multiloop Feynman diagrams, more efficient jet clustering, improved simulations of parton showers, and many other tasks. In this work, the focus will be on two specific applications: first, the identification of the causal structure of multiloop vacuum amplitudes, a key ingredient of the Loop-Tree Duality and an area with deep connections to graph theory; and second, the integration and sampling of high-dimensional functions. The latter constitutes a first step toward the realization of a fully fledged quantum event generator operating at high perturbative orders.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess how dark extra dimension models, which naturally include right-handed neutrinos, influence neutrino oscillation parameters and test them against experimental data.

Method: Computed neutrino oscillation spectra within and without extra dimension models, compared results with T2K and NOvA experiment data.

Result: Data aligns with standard oscillation predictions; stringent exclusion limits set on extra dimension parameters at high confidence levels.

Conclusion: Constraints from neutrino experiments complement those from colliders and cosmology, offering a more complete understanding of dark dimension right-handed neutrinos.

Abstract: Right-handed neutrinos are naturally induced by dark extra dimension models and play an essential role in neutrino oscillations. The model parameters can be examined by the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we compute the predicted neutrino oscillation spectra within/without extra dimension models and compare them with the experimental data. We find that the neutrino data in the T2K and NOvA experiments are compatible with the standard neutrino oscillation hypothesis. The results set the stringent exclusion limit on the extra dimension model parameters at a high confidence level. The derived constraints on dark dimension right-handed neutrinos are complementary to those results from the collider experiments and cosmological observations.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates how inflationary production of massive dark photons with non-minimal gravitational couplings exhibits unexpected growth at high momenta, but finds that this growth doesn't occur in gauge-invariant UV-complete models that are also free from ghost instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address potential issues in effective models (like uncontrolled growth and ghost instabilities) by studying UV-complete theories that provide a stable description of dark photons during inflation.

Method: They compared the behavior of effective models with non-minimal couplings to gravity against explicit gauge-invariant UV-complete models, analyzing the production rates and stability of dark photons during inflation.

Result: The UV-complete models do not exhibit the surprising momentum growth seen in effective models and are free from ghost instabilities, suggesting that effective models' problematic features are artifacts requiring UV completion.

Conclusion: Gauge-invariant UV completions are essential for stable and reliable predictions about dark photon production during inflation, as they eliminate pathologies present in simpler effective descriptions.

Abstract: Inflationary production of massive dark photons with non-minimal couplings to gravity shows surprising growth at large momenta. These couplings appear in the effective low energy description of a more fundamental theory. We find that the growth is absent in explicit gauge invariant UV-complete models. Such completions are also free of "ghost" instabilities, which often appear in the effective models.

Abstract: We study extremal, rotating black holes in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-axion (EMA) theory through a combined near-horizon and bulk analysis. At the level of the near-horizon extremal geometry (NHEG), using the entropy function formalism, we prove that regular rotating attractors with axionic hair exist only for configurations that are purely electrically or purely magnetically charged; regular rotating dyonic attractors are excluded by the axion equation of motion, a result that we established perturbatively and non-perturbatively within the NHEG system. On the global side, we construct families of asymptotically flat, rotating extremal EMA black holes that interpolate to the electric NHEG branch, confirming that horizon data are fixed by extremization of the entropy function and decoupled from asymptotic moduli in line with the attractor mechanism.

### [31] [Gravitation and Spacetime: Emergent from Spinor Interactions -- How?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00070)
*Martin Rainer*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the emergence of spacetime geometry from fundamental spinor-based constituents, comparing classical and quantum approaches like loop quantum gravity and causal fermion systems. It proposes that causal structure and spin networks arise from spinor interactions in spacetime regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental nature of spacetime gravity and determine whether it has classical/quantum constituents or is an effective theory arising from quantum matter operators. This involves reconciling different approaches that use spinors for geometric description.

Method: Analyzes existing theories (loop quantum gravity, string theory, spinor gravity) highlighting their common spinor basis. Proposes a novel framework where causal structure and spin networks emerge from spinor interactions in causal double cone regions and their spatial projections.

Result: Shows that while different approaches yield similar spacetime properties (e.g., area law entropy), their foundational assumptions differ. The proposed projection mechanism unifies concepts from various theories under a spinor interaction framework.

Conclusion: Spacetime's geometric properties may arise universally from underlying spinor interactions regardless of specific fundamental constituents. Future research should focus on connecting different approaches through shared spinor-based mechanisms and testing the proposed projection model.

Abstract: Newtonian gravity arises as the nonrelativistic, static, weak-field limit of some Lorentzian spacetime geometry solving the generally covariant Einstein equations for a given matter field configuration. Spacetime geometry has a local description in the spinor basis of Penrose. The breakdown of relativistic quantum (field) theory at small distances suggests that, the Lorentzian geometry is to be modified below some regularization length. The thermodynamic correspondence, e.g. for black holes or other horizons, indicates that, Lorentzian spacetime is an emergent geometric description of an ensemble of more fundamental constituents. The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order).
  Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open. We compare some very different classical and quantum approaches to spacetime geometry, all deriving in one way or another from spinors, and comment on questions for future research in order to clarify their relations. We propose that both, the causal structure and the spin networks for generation of discrete geometry arise via projection from all particle spinors (fermionic and bosonic) within a causal double cone region and their spin interwining interaction events onto a spatial section of this double cone region.

Abstract: Higher-order perturbations during the ringdown phase are essential for testing gravitational theories. This requires a perturbation framework that extends beyond General Relativity, as well as an appropriate method for reconstructing the spacetime metric. In this work, we address these challenges within the context of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. We introduce a modified Teukolsky equation for perturbative calculations in asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric spacetimes. The metric reconstruction method, which does not rely on the Hertz potential, is extended to $tr$-symmetric spacetime, allowing for the calculation of metric components under specific gauge conditions. Additionally, we present a second-order perturbation theory applicable to generic spherically symmetric spacetimes.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave tails can potentially serve as observational signatures to detect quantum gravitational effects near black holes, highlighting the importance of quantum considerations in future gravitational wave studies.

Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy plays a pivotal role in testing the dynamics of gravity in strong-field regimes and probing the nature of black holes. Motivated by recent studies on late-time tails in gravitational waves, we examine the gravitational wave tails of black holes incorporating quantum corrections within the framework of effective Loop Quantum Gravity. Our findings indicate that both the amplitudes and the intermediate behavior of these tails are influenced by quantum corrections. We demonstrate that the amplitude and transient characteristics of the tail are sensitive to the specific details of the black hole's dynamics.

Abstract: Within a generally covariant Hamiltonian framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), two black hole models parameterized by a quantum correction $ζ$ have recently been constructed. Using extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as high-precision probes, we investigate the imprints of this LQG deformation in the surrounding spacetime. Waveforms generated via an improved augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model in both LQG-BH backgrounds and in Schwarzschild spacetime are compared through a faithfulness analysis. This allows us to quantify the detectability of the deviation with LISA and to derive constraints on $ζ$ based on a detection threshold. We find that the first LQG-BH model produces significantly stronger signatures in EMRI signals than the second, making its quantum gravity effects more accessible to future space-borne gravitational-wave detection.

Analytical solutions and cosmological parameters' evolution are derived and analyzed.

Motivation: To address the cosmological constant problem and explain the universe's accelerated expansion without dark energy, by exploring time-varying Λ in Brans-Dicke framework.

Method: Developed two dynamical vacuum models (hybrid Λ(t)=αH²+βȦ and power-law Λ(H)=α₁Hⁿ) within Brans-Dicke theory, derived analytical solutions for Hubble parameter and related cosmological quantities, analyzed evolution of deceleration parameter, effective equation of state, cosmographic parameters, and current universe age.

Result: Obtained viable analytical solutions consistent with cosmic acceleration. Parameters' evolution shows transition from deceleration to acceleration, effective equation of state crossing phantom divide, and universe age matching observational constraints.

Conclusion: Dynamical vacuum models in Brans-Dicke theory successfully describe cosmic acceleration without dark energy. The hybrid and power-law models provide physically viable scenarios supported by cosmological tests, offering alternative to ΛCDM.

Abstract: In this research work, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of Brans-Dicke theory by considering dynamical vacuum energy models with a time-varying cosmological constant. Two vacuum energy models are studied, namely the hybrid vacuum law $Λ(t)=αH^{2}+β\dot{H}$ and the power vacuum law $Λ(H)=α_{1}H^{n}$, where $α$, $β$, $α_{1}$ and $n$ are free parameters. We derive analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter and other relevant cosmological quantities. The evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective equation of state, the cosmographic parameters and the present age of the universe are also analyzed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how black hole deformation affects orbital structures and gravitational wave emissions detectable by future space-based observatories.

Method: 1. Analyze properties of circular orbits under black hole deformation. 2. Use an orbital taxonomy to classify zoom-whirl periodic orbits. 3. Compute gravitational waveforms from different periodic orbits.

Result: Circular orbits can disappear with sufficient deformation, and periodic orbits exhibit distinct zoom-whirl behaviors. The deformation significantly impacts gravitational wave signals, which are detectable by future instruments.

Conclusion: Black hole deformation strongly influences both orbital dynamics and resulting gravitational waves, offering new observational tests for alternative gravity theories.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.

This spacetime is shown to be isometric to the Reissner-Nordström spacetime. The study extends previous photon sphere classifications by addressing massive particle spheres across various particle energies using conformal positive energy theorems and transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the uniqueness of spacetimes with both electric/magnetic charges and massive particle spheres, extending prior work on photon spheres and ensuring consistency with the Reissner-Nordström solution. This deepens understanding of black hole uniqueness and energy conditions in general relativity.

Method: The authors employ the conformal positive energy theorem, positive mass theorem, and conformal transformations to analyze spacetime foliations. They consider the entire set of massive particle spheres associated with different particle energies, leveraging these tools to prove isometry to Reissner-Nordström spacetime.

Result: The spacetime is uniquely determined as Reissner-Nordström with given electric/magnetic charges. The analysis confirms the existence of all possible spacetime foliations corresponding to massive particle spheres across varying energies.

Conclusion: The uniqueness result reinforces the Reissner-Nordström spacetime's status under these conditions. It provides a framework for studying particle interactions in charged black hole spacetimes and validates the utility of conformal methods in general relativistic uniqueness proofs.

Abstract: Uniqueness of the four-dimensional static, asymptotically flat, Einstein-Maxwell spacetime with both electric and magnetic charges, containing non-extremal massive particle sphere, being an inner boundary in it, has been proved. It is isometric to Reissner-Nordström spacetime with electric/magnetic charges. In contrast to the previous results concerning the classification of photon spheres, it describes the existence of the entire set of spacetme foliations, a set of massive particle sphere addressed to the various energies of the particles. The conformal positive energy, positive mass theorem and adequate conformal transformations constitute the mail tools in the proof.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines the ghost dark energy model in Brans-Dicke cosmology with an interacting scalar field, revealing quintessence-like behavior currently and phantom-like possibilities, a past deceleration-acceleration transition, and a future deceleration phase. It also confirms the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the cosmological implications of an interacting ghost dark energy model in Brans-Dicke theory using a logarithmic scalar field, investigating the dynamics of dark energy and dark matter interaction, and validating thermodynamic consistency.

Method: Deriving evolution equations for a flat FLRW universe under Brans-Dicke gravity with a logarithmic scalar field and a sign-changeable interaction term between ghost dark energy and dark matter. Analyzed cosmological parameters (equation of state, deceleration) via graph plotting and examined phase transitions in the $w_D-w_D'$ plane.

Result: Equation of state exhibits quintessence behavior now/future but allows phantom scenarios. Deceleration parameter shows smooth recent acceleration transition and future deceleration. Trajectories in the $w_D-w_D'$ plane move from freezing to thawing regions. Generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied.

Conclusion: The model successfully describes observed cosmic acceleration with possible future evolution phases, validates thermodynamic principles, and shows interplay between interaction terms and cosmological parameter behavior.

Abstract: In this study, we analyze the ghost dark energy model in Brans-Dicke cosmology in the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. We consider an interaction between ghost dark energy and dark matter with a sign-changeable interaction term. To discuss the cosmological implications of the model, we consider a well-motivated logarithmic form of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. By deriving the cosmological evolution equations, we obtain the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and deceleration parameters. We analyze the behavior of the cosmological parameters by plotting their graphs against the redshift parameter ($z$). We observe that the equation of state parameter shows quintessence-like behaviour during present and future epochs; however, phantom-like behavior is also possible for suitable values of the model parameters. Analysis of the deceleration parameter shows a smooth recent phase transition of the universe (deceleration to acceleration). An interesting result we observe is the decelerated expansion of the universe in the far future, i.e, the universe experiences another phase transition in the future. The physical significance of the well-known cosmological plane ($w_D-w_D'$ plane) is discussed in our model. We observe that the trajectories start in the freezing region with the same initial behavior, deviate from each other during the evolution and ends in the thawing region. Finally, we perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis and demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied within the present interacting ghost dark energy model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the ambiguity of graviton masses in de Sitter spacetime compared to the clear understanding in Minkowski spacetime.

Method: Applied a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics to identify collective modes analogous to second sound in superfluid dynamics.

Result: Discovered a massless collective mode propagating at light speed, interpreted as a potential massless graviton in de Sitter spacetime.

Conclusion: The identified mode suggests a massless graviton in de Sitter spacetime, but further work is needed to classify its nature precisely.

Abstract: The concept of gravitons and their masses, clear in the case of Minkowski spacetime, remains ambiguous for de Sitter spacetime. Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We show that quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in Kerr-de Sitter and Myers-Perry black holes exhibit an exceptional line (EL), which is a continuous set of exceptional points (EPs) in parameter space, at which two QNM frequencies and their associated solutions coincide. We find that the EL appears in the parameter space spanned by the scalar mass and the black hole spin parameter, and also in the Nariai limit, i.e., $r_{\rm c} - r_{\rm h} \to 0$, where $r_{\rm c}$ and $r_{\rm h}$ denote the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons, respectively. We analytically study the amplitudes or excitation factors of QNMs near the EL. Such an analytic treatment becomes possible since, in the Nariai limit, the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation with the Pöschl-Teller (PT) potential. We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically. Our conditions apply to a broad class of systems that involve the excitation of (nearly) double-pole QNMs.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that first-order thermodynamic corrections to black holes can be derived using an extremalization principle applied to higher-derivative gravity theories, even beyond Einstein gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the applicability of the extremalization principle for calculating black hole thermodynamics perturbatively beyond Einstein's gravity to more general higher-derivative theories.

Method: The authors use the extremalization approach of Euclidean action formulation to compute first-order corrections caused by higher-derivative terms in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, avoiding explicit construction of perturbed black hole solutions.

Result: Successful derivation of first-order thermodynamic corrections in both asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes without needing exact black hole solutions, showing the method's broad applicability.

Conclusion: The extremalization principle is a versatile tool for perturbative calculations in higher-derivative gravity theories, offering a pathway to study black hole thermodynamics without solving complicated field equations.

Abstract: When higher-derivative terms are added to a gravitational action, black hole solutions and their thermodynamic properties are generally corrected. Recent progress has shown that, by treating higher-derivative operators as perturbations, the first-order corrections to black hole thermodynamics can be obtained without explicit knowledge of the corresponding perturbed black hole solutions. This result can be understood as a consequence of an extremalization principle underlying the Euclidean action formulation of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we emphasize that this extremalization approach is not restricted to perturbations around Einstein gravity. Instead, it can be applied to perturbations of more general higher-derivative gravity theories whose black hole solutions are already known and can be taken as the zeroth-order background. As an explicit illustration, we consider Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity as the zeroth-order theory and study the first-order thermodynamic corrections induced by further higher-order curvature operators. We show that these corrections can be derived without solving the perturbed black hole solutions, both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how primordial magnetic fields are amplified and to explain the prevalence of large-scale magnetic fields in the universe through computational methods linking magnetogenesis to cosmic perturbations.

Method: Applied 3+1 decomposition to first-order cosmological perturbations, derived the cosmological dynamo equation under kinematic-dynamo approximation, and used Einstein Toolkit and FLRWSolver to numerically evolve velocity fields.

Result: Demonstrated that growing scalar perturbation velocity fields amplify PMFs, with growth extent depending on cosmic medium's electrical conductivity.

Conclusion: Computational model successfully links primordial magnetogenesis to scalar perturbation evolution, offering an explanation for ubiquity of large-scale cosmic magnetic fields.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of PMFs within a perturbed Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime using the formalisms of Numerical Relativity (NR). We apply the 3+1 decomposition to first-order cosmological perturbations to derive the cosmological dynamo equation under the kinematic-dynamo approximation. Our objective is to study the interaction between the seed magnetic field and the growing modes of scalar perturbations, whose associated velocity fields are evolved numerically using the software \texttt{Einstein Toolkit} and \texttt{FLRWSolver}. We find that these velocity fields effectively drive the amplification of the PMF, demonstrating that the extent of this growth is dependent on the electrical conductivity of the cosmic medium. Our findings provide a computational description linking primordial magnetogenesis to the evolution of magnetic seeds, ultimately explaining the ubiquity of large-scale magnetic fields in the universe
