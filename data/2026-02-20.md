Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents the first direct measurement of a positive period derivative (Ṗ ≈ 1.7×10⁻² d/d) in the quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source ZTF19acnskyy/“Ansky”. This unexpected result challenges existing EMRI models, prompting exploration of multiple explanations, none of which fully account for the observations. Further research is needed to explain positive period derivatives in QPEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the observed positive period derivative in QPEs, which is unexpected in current EMRI models, and to explore possible physical mechanisms that could explain this phenomenon.

Method: The study involves direct measurement of the period derivative in the QPE source ZTF19acnskyy. Several models are analyzed, including EMRI with mass-transfer, tidal interactions, relativistic precession, light travel-time delays in SMBH binaries, and disk instability models.

Result: The observed Ṗ is inconsistent with all tested models, indicating that current theoretical frameworks fail to fully explain the positive period derivative. This highlights gaps in understanding QPEs and EMRI dynamics.

Conclusion: The results challenge existing models for QPEs, emphasizing the need for new theoretical work to explain positive period derivatives and refine EMRI and other model parameters to match observational data.

Abstract: We report the first direct measurement of the period derivative in a quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), finding a smoothly increasing period with $\dot{P}\approx (1.7\pm 0.02)\times10^{-2}$ d d$^{-1}$ in the source ZTF19acnskyy/"Ansky". Most models for QPEs invoke repeated interactions of a stellar-mass orbiting companion around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In these scenarios, a positive $\dot{P}$ is surprising, but not impossible to produce. We explore several possible explanations for the observed $\dot{P}$, including stable mass-transfer driven by impulsive mass loss events in an EMRI, velocity kicks at pericenter due to tidal interactions with the SMBH, apparent period changes due either to general relativistic precession effects in an EMRI or light travel-time delays in a hierarchical SMBH binary, and mass-transfer variations in a thermal/viscous disk instability model. We find that none of the considered models provides a complete explanation for the data, motivating further work on physical explanations for positive period derivatives in QPEs.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1) and subsequent alerts using HAWC γ-ray data to search for coincident neutrino/gamma-ray signals. The 5% coincidence rate aligns with background expectations, with two coincidences involving AGN Markarian 421 and 501. The study evaluates the potential for false positives and discusses results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate astrophysical sources of neutrinos by cross-correlating IceCube neutrino alerts with HAWC gamma-ray observations, aiming to identify coincident signals that could indicate sources of cosmic rays.

Method: The method involves using the Bayesian Block algorithm on 368 IceCube alerts (up to July 2025) within HAWC's field of view, analyzing archival HAWC gamma-ray data for temporal and spatial coincidences with neutrinos.

Result: A 5% coincident detection rate consistent with background expectations was observed. Two coincidences involved known AGN (Markarian 421/501), but the analysis suggests these are likely statistical fluctuations rather than true astrophysical associations.

Conclusion: The results imply that no statistically significant neutrino/gamma-ray correlations were found beyond background expectations. The study highlights challenges in confirming astrophysical neutrino sources and underscores the need for further multi-messenger observations to strengthen source identification.

Abstract: Neutrino emission from astrophysical sources has long been considered a signature of cosmic-ray acceleration. The IceCube neutrino observatory has observed a diffuse flux of TeV-PeV neutrinos, but very few confirmed sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), IceCube has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since May 2011. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $γ$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view. We observe approximately a 5\% coincident detection rate, which is consistent with expectations from background. Two of these detections contain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. We discuss the likelihood that the neutrino/$γ$-ray coincidences are false positives and a brief overview of the results.

### [3] [X-ray Spectral-Timing Properties of Tidal Disruption Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16868)
*Joheen Chakraborty,Megan Masterson,Andrew Mummery,Erin Kara,Christos Panagiotou,Riccardo Arcodia,Vera Berger*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes X-ray variability in 18 tidal disruption events (TDEs) using XMM-Newton data, finding that TDEs with coronae exhibit higher variability and steeper PSDs compared to thermal-dominated states, similar to X-ray binaries but differing from AGN coronae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate minute-to-hour X-ray variability in TDEs systematically, understand accretion physics, and compare TDE coronae with AGN and X-ray binaries.

Method: Analyzing 54 XMM-Newton observations of 18 TDEs, measuring spectral properties, PSDs, fractional variability, and energy dependence using Fourier methods.

Result: TDEs with coronae show higher X-ray variability, steeper PSDs (longer correlation timescales), energy-dependent variations in thermal states, and differences from AGN coronae.

Conclusion: X-ray timing and spectral analysis of TDEs probe accretion flow microphysics; TDE coronae differ fundamentally from AGN, highlighting unique newborn accretion dynamics.

Abstract: We perform the first systematic study of the minute-to-hours-timescale stochastic variability observed in the X-ray luminosity of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using XMM-Newton data and Fourier analysis methods. We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN.

### [4] [Theory of striped dynamic spectra of the Crab pulsar high-frequency interpulse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16955)
*Mikhail V. Medvedev*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper develops a theory explaining the spectral 'zebra' pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse emission through interference effects caused by gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing. It predicts a change in the pattern's trend at frequencies above 42–650 GHz, accessible with telescopes like ALMA and SMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the observed spectral 'zebra' pattern and enable tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, while probing strong-field gravity near the pulsar surface.

Method: Analysis of interference maxima from multiple light-ray paths in the magnetosphere, considering gravitational lensing and plasma effects to model emission bands and derive radial plasma density profiles.

Result: The model matches the $n_e ∝ r^{-3}$ plasma density profile theoretically, predicts a frequency range (42–650 GHz) where ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size, enabling magnetosphere tomography.

Conclusion: Observations at predicted frequencies using ALMA/SMA could verify the theory, improve magnetosphere understanding, and explore strong-field gravity near pulsars.

Abstract: A theory of the spectral "zebra" pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.

### [5] [Illuminating the Mass Gap Through Deep Optical Constraint on a Neutron Star Merger Candidate S250206dm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17267)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of the gravitational wave event S250206dm using the WFST telescope found no electromagnetic counterparts, leading to constraints on its potential kilonova and progenitor system characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe electromagnetic signatures from a neutron star merger in the mass gap and constrain the properties of the progenitor system using optical observations.

Method: A deep multiband search with the 2.5-meter WFST covering 64% of the localization region, achieving 23 mag 5σ depth, identifying 12 candidates that were ruled out as related to S250206dm.

Result: Non-detection of an电磁 signal led to exclusion of an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc and disfavoring neutron star-black hole systems with mass ratio Q ≥ 3.2.

Conclusion: WFST's rapid, deep follow-up provides optical constraints on mass ratios comparable to GW data, demonstrating the telescope's effectiveness in studying mass gap objects and progenitor systems.

Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) event S250206dm, as the first well-localized neutron star merger candidate potentially located in the mass gap, presented a unique opportunity to probe the electromagnetic signatures from such a system. Here we report a deep, multiband search with the new 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), covering about 64% of the localization region up to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of 23 mag. In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q >= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal. This work presents the best observation of this type of events until now, and demonstrates the power of rapid, deep follow-up observations to constrain the properties of compact binary progenitors, offering key insights into the constituents of the mass gap.

### [6] [WFST Supernovae in the First Year: I. Statistical Study of 16 Early-phase Type Ia Supernovae from the Pilot Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17268)

Connolly,Ziqing Jia,Lei Hu,Lulu Fan,Ning Jiang,Feng Li,Ming Liang,Jinlong Tang,Zhen Wan,Hairen Wang,Jian Wang,Yongquan Xue,Hongfei Zhang,Wen Zhao,Xianzhong Zheng,Qingfeng Zhu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents 16 early-phase Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during the WFST-PS pilot survey, including three with early-excess emission (EExSNe Ia). Key findings highlight significant color index scatter in the first 10 days, brighter peak luminosities, and longer rise times for EExSNe Ia compared to non-EExSNe Ia. These results suggest that current theoretical models need improvement to explain early photometric evolution, and emphasize the importance of early near-UV observations for understanding SNe Ia explosions and progenitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia and constrain their explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems through high-cadence ugr-band observations, as existing models fail to fully explain the observed phenomena.

Method: The study uses data from the WFST-PS pilot survey (March-April 2024) to observe 16 early-phase SNe Ia. Analysis includes comparing discovery magnitudes, color indices, peak luminosities, and rise times between EExSNe Ia and non-EExSNe Ia.

Result: Key results include: 1) 16 SNe Ia detected 3 magnitudes below peak brightness; 2) large color index scatter in first 10 days; 3) EExSNe Ia exhibit brighter peaks and longer rise times; 4) current models inadequate for early-phase evolution.

Conclusion: Early near-UV observations are critical for refining supernova models. The findings necessitate theoretical model improvements and highlight the WFST-PS survey's role in advancing understanding of SNe Ia progenitors and explosion mechanisms.

Abstract: In this paper we present 16 early-phase type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during the pilot survey of the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST-PS) from March 4 to July 10, 2024, including three SNe Ia with early-excess emission features (EExSNe Ia). The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia. Based on the initial high-cadence ugr-band data from the WFST-PS survey, we emphasize that early near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations are indispensable for placing tight constraints on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems of SNe Ia.

### [7] [WFST Supernovae in the First Year: II. SN 2024aedt: Systematical Study of a Transitional Type Ia Supernova](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17269)

Connolly,Ziqing Jia,Lei Hu,Weiyu Ding,Lulu Fan,Feng Li,Ming Liang,Jinlong Tang,Zhen Wan,Hairen Wang,Jian Wang,Yongquan Xue,Hongfei Zhang,Wen Zhao,Xianzhong Zheng,Qingfeng Zhu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The discovery and analysis of the transitional Type Ia SN 2024aedt reveals its unique placement between normal and subluminous supernovae, with properties explained by both delayed-detonation and double-detonation models, emphasizing the need for early observations to study diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the transitional nature of SN 2024aedt and its position in the classification of Type Ia supernovae, and to test theoretical explosion models against observational data.

Method: Comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations, light-curve modeling with MOSFiT, comparison with DDT and DDet scenarios, and spectral feature analysis of early-phase blue-end emissions.

Result: SN 2024aedt exhibits transitional properties in light curve and color evolution; MOSFiT models yield low Ni-56 and ejecta masses. Both DDT and DDet models are plausible, but early excess emissions (predictive of DDet) are undetected. Spectral diversity in early phases is noted, becoming homogeneous later.

Conclusion: Early-time observations are critical in understanding SN Ia diversity. The transitional SN 2024aedt supports multiple explosion scenarios but lacks definitive evidence for double-detonation, highlighting the need for more rapid observational coverage post-explosion.

Abstract: We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of a transitional type Ia SN 2024aedt, discovered by the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) within one day of the explosion. Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $Δm_{15}(B) = 1.53 \pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $Δm_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \pm 0.042\,M_{\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \pm 0.108\,M_{\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes seven supernovae with double-peaked light curves and shock-cooling emissions, revealing they belong to a transitional population between ultra-stripped and normal stripped-envelope supernovae. Ejecta masses (1.1-2.6 M☉) and progenitor characteristics (yellow/blue supergiants with radii 120-300 R☉, ZAMS masses 8-20 M☉) suggest formation via binary evolution rather than single-star pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin and properties of supernovae exhibiting unique light-curve features and shock-cooling emissions, particularly their placement in the evolutionary spectrum between USSNe and SESNe.

Method: Joint analysis using an analytic early shock-cooling model and the Arnett radioactive-diffusion model to fit bolometric light curves. Empirical relations were applied to estimate progenitor luminosities and masses.

Result: Ejecta masses (1.1-2.6 M☉), envelope masses (0.1-0.4 M☉), progenitor radii (120-300 R☉), and ZAMS masses (8-20 M☉) were derived. Progenitors are likely YSGs/BSGs formed via binary interactions.

Conclusion: These supernovae represent a transitional category requiring binary evolution for low ejecta masses, challenging single-star evolutionary models.

Abstract: We investigate the multiband photometric properties of seven supernovae (SNe) showing double-peaked light-curve evolution and prominent shock-cooling emission, observed by the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) during its first year of operation. By jointly employing an analytic early shock-cooling model and the Arnett radioactive-diffusion model, we fit the bolometric light curves and infer ejecta masses in the range $1.1$-$2.6 M_\odot$, consistent with a transitional population between ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) and normal stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). The envelope masses are estimated to be $M_{\rm env}=0.1$-$0.4 M_\odot$, while the progenitors are constrained to be yellow or blue supergiants (YSGs/BSGs) with radii of $R=120$-$300 R_\odot$. Using empirical relations, we estimate progenitor luminosities of $L=10^{4.6}$-$10^{4.9} L_\odot$, corresponding to zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of $8$-$20 M_\odot$. Theoretical models suggest that such progenitors are more naturally produced through binary evolution channels, as single-star evolutionary pathways are unable to yield ejecta masses this low.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel discontinuous Galerkin method for the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system, offering a high-order, conservative, noise-free numerical scheme for simulating extreme relativistic plasmas across various astrophysical and laboratory scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional Monte-Carlo methods (notable Poisson noise) and the need to accurately model extreme relativistic plasma phenomena, such as QED pair-production, neutron star magnetosphere dynamics, and relativistic reconnection.

Method: Discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of phase-space with a novel velocity-space mapping technique to handle wide energy ranges, enabling efficient and accurate simulation of relativistic plasmas.

Result: Demonstrates a noise-free approach capable of resolving fine-scale phase-space structures and electromagnetic emission details in scenarios like QED pair plasmas, magnetar instabilities, and relativistic reconnection.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust alternative to Monte-Carlo techniques, offering precise analysis of relativistic plasma dynamics without noise, advancing understanding in extreme astrophysical and laboratory plasma environments.

Abstract: We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments. The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of Markarian 590's multi-decadal observations reveals a rare, time-resolved AGN state transition, showing scale-invariant accretion physics across black hole masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To observe and understand the dynamic accretion processes in AGNs by studying a rare case where a full spectral state transition is captured in real time.

Method: Decade-long multi-band data from Swift observatory; analysis of $α_{ox}$ variation with $λ_{Edd}$; HID tracking of accretion states; comparison to theoretical models like thermal wavefront propagation and coronal-jet coupling.

Result: Mkn 590 transitions from a faint hard X-ray state to a bright UV/soft X-ray state over ~10 years; $α_{ox}$ shows V-shaped dependence with a critical Eddington ratio break; matches patterns in X-ray binaries/CLQSOs; Fundamental Plane slope discrepancy suggests persistent coronal-jet coupling.

Conclusion: Mkn 590's behavior validates scale-invariant accretion physics between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes, emphasizing thermal wavefronts and coronal-jet interactions as key mechanisms.

Abstract: The Seyfert galaxy Markarian 590 offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic life cycle of black hole accretion, captured across multiple wavelengths from the years 1975 to 2025. Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $α_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $λ_{Edd}$, with a break at $λ_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes using modified parton distribution functions (PDFs) in muon beams at future muon colliders to probe physics beyond the Standard Model, demonstrating that this PDF-based approach outperforms direct searches for an L_μ − L_τ gauge boson in certain mass ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore novel strategies for discovering new physics at high-energy muon colliders by leveraging modifications to muon PDFs, which can indirectly signal the presence of beyond Standard Model particles.

Method: The authors analyze how light beyond Standard Model particles (e.g., an L_μ − L_τ gauge boson) modify muon PDFs, altering kinematics in hard processes. They apply this framework to a case study involving gauge bosons with masses 50-100 GeV, comparing indirect PDF-based probes against traditional direct production searches.

Result: The PDF-based approach outperforms direct production searches for the L_μ − L_τ gauge boson in the 50–100 GeV mass range, showcasing the potential of muon PDF probes for beyond Standard Model studies.

Conclusion: Muon collider experiments using PDF modifications offer a powerful and promising avenue for indirect searches of new physics, complementing or surpassing conventional detection methods.

Abstract: We present an analysis strategy for probing physics beyond the Standard Model via modifications to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in a muon beam, which measurably alter the kinematics of all hard processes at a future muon collider. High-energy muon colliders represent an opportunity to probe new physics using precision measurements and novel search strategies. At sufficiently high energies, light particles act as ``constituents'' of the muon described by PDFs. As a concrete case study, we apply this framework to an $L_μ - L_τ$ gauge boson and demonstrate that, for masses in the range of approximately 50--100 GeV, this indirect PDF-based approach outperforms traditional searches relying on direct gauge boson production. These results highlight muon PDF probes as a powerful and promising avenue for beyond the Standard Model physics searches at a future muon collider.

*Jason Arakawa,Jack F. Doyle,Elina Fuchs,Jacob S. Higgins,Fiona Kirk,Kai Li,Tian Ooi,Gilad Perez,Wolfram Ratzinger,Marianna S. Safronova,Thorsten Schumm,Jun Ye,Chuankun Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an ultrasensitive search for ultralight dark matter using the nuclear isomeric transition in ^{229}Th, setting the strongest bounds in the mass range 10^-21 eV to 10^-19 eV and probing interactions exceeding the Planck scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect oscillations in nuclear parameters caused by ultralight dark matter, which requires extreme sensitivity; conventional methods are insufficient due to weak couplings or high suppression scales.

Method: Utilizes precision nuclear spectroscopy of ^{229}Th isomeric transition, leveraging its unique low-energy state and enhanced sensitivity from a near cancellation between electromagnetic and nuclear contributions.

Result: Established the strongest constraints on dark matter masses between 10^-21 and 10^-19 eV, probing interaction scales over 10^6 times the Planck scale (Mega-Planck scale).

Conclusion: The ^{229}Th system is confirmed as the leading probe for dark matter couplings to the nuclear sector, opening new avenues for testing ultra-high energy physics.

Abstract: Ultralight dark matter is expected to induce oscillations of nuclear parameters. These oscillations are characterized by extremely weak couplings or high suppression scales, with the Planck scale - the characteristic scale of quantum gravity - serving as a natural benchmark. Probing this phenomenon requires systems with exceptional sensitivity to shifts in nuclear energies. The uniquely low-energy nuclear isomeric transition in ${}^{229}$Th provides such sensitivity: it directly probes the nuclear interaction and, owing to a near cancellation between electromagnetic and nuclear contributions, its response to changes in nuclear structure is greatly amplified. We devise and perform a new type of ultrasensitive search for dark matter which uses the precision nuclear spectroscopy at JILA to set the strongest bounds in the mass range $10^{-21}\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 10^{-19}\,{\rm eV}$. Our results probe effective interaction scales exceeding $10^6$ times the Planck scale (the Mega-Planck scale) and establish the ${}^{229}$Th system as the leading probe of dark matter couplings to the nuclear sector.

### [13] [Rescuing Overabundant Dark Matter with a Strongly First Order Phase Transition in the Dark Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16822)
*Peisi Huang,Anibal D. Medina,Carlos E. M. Wagner*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a scenario where a dark sector with fermionic dark matter interacts with the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. The observed dark matter abundance is achieved through entropy injection from a strongly first-order phase transition of the dark Higgs post freeze-out, which also generates a detectable gravitational wave signal. For low-mass DM (<10 GeV), this process could explain the NANOGrav signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard models with dark matter annihilating through kinetic mixing often overproduce relic density. The study aims to resolve this by introducing a phase transition that reduces excess abundance via entropy injection, offering a viable pathway and a testable gravitational wave signature.

Method: The authors analyze models where DM annihilates via a dark U(1) with kinetic mixing, then simulate a post-freeze-out first-order phase transition in the dark Higgs sector. They calculate entropy injection effects on relic density and derive gravitational wave spectra from bubble collisions during the phase transition.

Result: The phase transition must be supercooled to achieve observed relic density. The resulting gravitational waves fall within future experiment detectability. Supercooling also allows compatibility with the NANOGrav anomaly for DM masses below ~10 GeV.

Conclusion: Entropy injection from a supercooled dark Higgs phase transition is a viable mechanism to regulate DM abundance. This framework connects particle physics to cosmological observations and gravitational wave astronomy, providing multiple experimental probes.

Abstract: We consider a dark sector consisting of fermionic dark matter (DM) charged under a broken dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry, interacting with the Standard Model through kinetic mixing. In such models, the DM annihilation cross section is typically suppressed by the small kinetic mixing and or a heavy mediator, often leading to an overabundant relic density. We show that the observed DM abundance can be achieved if the dark Higgs undergoes a strong first order phase transition after DM freeze-out. In this scenario, the relic abundance is set by thermal freeze-out in the symmetric phase and subsequently reduced by entropy injection from the phase transition, rather than by annihilation in the broken phase. We find that to reproduce the observed relic abundance, the required phase transition is generically supercooled. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal lies within the sensitivity of future experiments, providing a complementary probe of this framework. Moreover, a strongly supercooled phase transition can potentially account for the NANOGrav signal for DM masses below $O(10)$ GeV.

### [14] [New Physics and Symmetry Tests with Polarized Photon Fusion and Dipole Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16834)
*Fang Xu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores using polarized photon fusion at the STCF to enhance sensitivity to anomalous dipole moments of tau leptons, distinguishing CP-even and CP-odd interactions. It demonstrates improved precision and provides a framework for probing new physics through dipole moment measurements in various fermionic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sensitivity to tau dipole moments and distinguish CP properties, leveraging polarization observables in high-energy collisions to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Method: Analyzing polarized photon fusion in $e^+ e^-$ collisions at STCF, focusing on $γγ → τ^+ τ^-$ processes in the nearly back-to-back region using TMD framework to isolate polarization effects and angular asymmetries.

Result: Demonstrated a 2σ reach improving bounds on the tau's anomalous magnetic moment (Re(a_τ)) to -4.6e-3 to 7.0e-3. Shows capability to disentangle CP-even/odd interactions through angular structures, with application examples in supersymmetric models with R-parity violation.

Conclusion: Polarized photon fusion combined with precision dipole measurements offers a powerful, complementary approach to test fundamental symmetries and probe beyond-Standard-Model physics across fermionic systems.

Abstract: We discuss new-physics searches and symmetry tests with dipole moments, emphasizing the role of polarization observables. As a primary benchmark, we consider polarized photon fusion in the $e^+ e^-$ environment of the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) and study $γγ\to τ^+ τ^-$ in the nearly back-to-back region, where a transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) description provides a convenient framework for organizing polarization effects. We show that linearly polarized photons induce characteristic azimuthal asymmetries in the $τ^+ τ^-$ kinematics, enabling polarization-based observables that enhance sensitivity to the $τ$ electromagnetic dipole form factors. Moreover, $CP$-even and $CP$-odd dipole interactions can be disentangled through distinct angular structures, offering a systematic path to probe $τ$ dipole moments with improved precision at future lepton colliders. As an illustration, we obtain an improved $2σ$ reach on the anomalous magnetic dipole moment, $-4.6 \times 10^{-3} < \mathrm{Re}(a_τ) < 7.0 \times 10^{-3}$, reaching a precision level close to the Standard Model expectation. To place these prospects in a broader context, we briefly summarize the experimental status of dipole-moment measurements across different fermionic systems and highlight their complementarity in constraining new physics. We illustrate this interplay with supersymmetric scenarios featuring $R$-parity violation, in which loop-induced dipole moments provide correlated probes of $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating interactions. Taken together, polarized photon fusion and precision dipole measurements constitute a coherent program for testing fundamental symmetries and exploring physics beyond the Standard Model.

### [15] [Relativistic corrections to gluon fragmentation into the $^3P_{J}^{[1,8]}$ states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16920)
*Zhi-Guo He,Bernd A. Kniehl,Peng Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines relativistic corrections to gluon fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonium Fock states in NRQCD. It shows that S-D mixing is essential to remove infrared divergences in P-wave production, leading to non-proportional short-distance coefficients compared to S-waves. These corrections are significant and negative, impacting J/ψ production studies at the LHC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address relativistic effects (v² corrections) in gluon fragmentation to P-wave quarkonium states, ensuring infrared divergence cancellation and improving precision predictions for J/ψ production.

Method: Computed NRQCD matrix elements and short-distance coefficients for 3P_J^[1,8] Fock states at order v², incorporating S-D mixing effects within the non-relativistic QCD factorization framework.

Result: Relativistic corrections are negative and substantial (~non-negligible), short-distance coefficients for leading/sub-leading orders aren't proportional (unlike S-waves), but their convolution with gluon cross-section yields near-constant ratios across transverse momenta.

Conclusion: Relativistic corrections must be included in J/ψ production analyses at the LHC to achieve accurate results, highlighting the necessity of considering S-D mixing for infrared finiteness in P-wave cases.

Abstract: We compute relativistic corrections to the gluon fragmentation functions to ${}^3P_J^{[1,8]}$ Fock states of heavy quarkonium within non-relativistic QCD factorization framework. We find that, at $\mathcal{O}(v^2)$ sub-leading order, the $S$-$D$ mixing effect must be taken into account to absorb the infrared divergence of spin-triplet $P$-wave production within full QCD into the NRQCD long-distance matrix elements. Unlike the $S$-wave case, we find that the short-distance coefficients of the fragmentation functions at leading and sub-leading order are no longer proportional to each other. However, upon convolution with the gluon production cross section, their ratios are almost constant across the whole $p_T$ region. We find the relativistic corrections to be negative and substantial, which makes them a non-negligible ingredient in the study of $J/ψ$ production at the LHC.

*Xin-Ru Liu,Qi Liu,He Song,Jiao-Kai Chen*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper applies the Regge trajectory approach to doubly heavy triquarks, estimating their spectra through λ and ρ trajectories, and predicts spin-averaged masses of pentaquarks consistent with other theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a new method for estimating spectra of triquarks and excitations of pentaquarks/hexaquarks using Regge trajectories, offering simplicity over existing approaches.

Method: Proposed Regge trajectory relations for doubly heavy triquarks, applied to eight specific triquark systems. Calculated λ- and ρ-trajectories, and used these to estimate spectra and pentaquark masses.

Result: Successful estimation of triquark spectra and pentaquark masses matching other theories. Demonstrated Regge trajectory approach as a simple tool for triquark-based penta/hexaquark excitations.

Conclusion: Regge trajectories provide a viable, simple method for predicting triquark spectra and related hadronic states, supporting further application in hadron physics.

Abstract: We attempt to apply the Regge trajectory approach to the doubly heavy triquarks $((Qq)\bar{Q}^{\prime})$ $(Q,\,Q'=b,\,c; q=u,\,d,\,s)$. We propose the Regge trajectory relations for the doubly heavy triquarks, and then employ them to crudely estimate the spectra of the triquarks $((cu)\bar{c})$, $((cu)\bar{b})$, $((cs)\bar{c})$, $((cs)\bar{b})$, $((bu)\bar{c})$, $((bu)\bar{b})$, $((bs)\bar{c})$, and $((bs)\bar{b})$. The $λ$-trajectories and the $ρ$-trajectories are investigated. The triquark Regge trajectory becomes a new and very simple approach for estimating the spectra of triquarks. It also provides a simple method to investigate the $ρ$-mode and $σ$-mode excitations of pentaquarks and hexaquarks in the triquark picutre. Moreover, the spin-averaged masses of the ground states of pentaquarks $(\bar{c}(cu))(cu)$, $(\bar{b}(bu))(bu)$ and $(\bar{c}(cu))(bu)$ are estimated, which are consistent with other theoretical predictions.

### [17] [Decoding the near-threshold $X_{0,\,1}(4140)$ and $X_{1}(4685)$ states via OZI-suppressed coupled-channel scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17125)
*Mao-Jun Yan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the near-threshold dynamics of $X_{0,1}(4140)$ and $X_{1}(4685)$ states through coupled-channel scattering in $B	o D_{s}ar{D}_{s} K$ decays. It identifies $X_{0}(4140)$ as a pole near the $J/ψφ$ threshold, predicts a $1^{++}$ virtual state for $X_{1}(4140)$, and interprets $X_{1}(4685)$ as a $ψ(2S)φ$ molecule, offering insights into OZI suppression and Fierz rearrangement mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the nature of $X(4140)$ and $X_{1}(4685)$ states by studying their near-threshold behaviors, resolving ambiguities in their widths and interpretations, and understanding OZI-suppressed dynamics in $B$ decays.

Method: OZI-suppressed coupled-channel scattering analysis of $D_{s}\bar{D}_{s}$, $J/ψφ$, and $D_{s}^{★}\bar{D}_{s}^{★}$ systems using effective range expansion. The spin-spin interaction is treated as a subleading effect, and heavy quark spin symmetry is applied to extend the model.

Result: The $X_{0}(4140)$ is linked to a $J/ψφ$ threshold pole, with a single-channel scattering length of $1.11	ext{ fm}$ and an effective scattering length of $0.12^{+0.20}_{-0.10}+i0.78^{+0.20}_{-0.40}	ext{ fm}$ when channels are coupled. A $1^{++}$ virtual state explains the width of $X_{1}(4140)$, while $X_{1}(4685)$ is interpreted as a $ψ(2S)φ$ molecule.

Conclusion: The findings unify the $X(4140)$ family and $X_{1}(4685)$ as manifestations of OZI suppression and Fierz rearrangement in low-energy QCD, providing critical tests for hadronic molecule models and quark-gluon dynamics.

Abstract: To decode the near-threshold dynamics of the $X_{0,\,1}(4140)$ and $X_{1}(4685)$ states, we investigate the OZI-suppressed $\{D_{s}\bar{D}_{s},\, J/ψφ,\, D_{s}^{\ast}\bar{D}_{s}^{\ast}\}$ coupled-channel scattering in $B\to D_{s}\bar{D}_{s} K$ decays using the effective range expansion. We demonstrate that the $X_{0}(4140)$, associated with a dip in the lineshape, corresponds to a dynamically generated pole near the $J/ψφ$ threshold. The single-channel $J/ψφ$ scattering length is extracted to be $1.11\pm 0.65\,\rm{fm}$, yielding an effective scattering length of $0.12^{+0.20}_{-0.10}+i0.78^{+0.20}_{-0.40} \, \rm{fm}$ when coupled channels are included. By treating the spin-spin interaction as a subleading effect, we predict a $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ virtual state near the $J/ψφ$ threshold, which naturally resolves the empirical ambiguities surrounding the $X_{1}(4140)$ width. Extending this framework via heavy quark spin symmetry, we further interpret the $X_{1}(4685)$ as a $ψ(2S)φ$ hadronic molecule. Ultimately, these findings highlight how the $X(4140)$ family and $X_{1}(4685)$ serve as unique theoretical windows into the Fierz rearrangement and OZI suppression mechanisms in low-energy strong interactions.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the unique properties of kaons and their strong interactions with nucleons and heavy-light mesons, leading to the formation of hadronic molecules like Λ(1405) and D*_{s0}(2317). It highlights the role of chiral dynamics and suggests potential three-body molecular states for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the peculiar interactions of kaons, driven by their status as heavy Nambu-Goldstone bosons, and comprehend their role in forming exotic particles through chiral dynamics.

Method: Review of recent developments in hadronic interactions involving kaons, focusing on molecular interpretations of particles like Λ(1405) and D*_{s0}(2317).

Result: Identifies kaon-induced strong interactions as key to explaining hadronic molecules, and predicts existence of three-body molecular states.

Conclusion: Chiral dynamics explains kaon's strong interactions leading to molecular particles, calling for experimental searches for three-body states.

Abstract: The kaon, the lightest hadron containing a strangeness quark, is very peculiar. It is a Nambu-Goldstone boson, but significantly heavier than the pion. As a result, its interaction with a matter particle, such as the nucleon or a heavy-light meson, such as the $D$ meson, is completely determined by chiral dynamics and much stronger than its pion cousin. The strong attractive interaction has brought us many surprises and is manifested in the peculiar nature of many particles, such as the mysterious $Λ(1405)$ and $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. These two particles can be understood as $\bar{K}N$ and $DK$ hadronic molecules, respectively. They also imply the existence of three-body hadronic molecules that await future discovery. In this talk, I review some recent developments in our understanding of hadronic interactions involving the kaon.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a viable experimental approach to confirm mirror matter existence with current technology.

Abstract: We analyze the possibility of detecting the existence of mirror matter, a possible component of dark matter, through neutron interferometry. We develop an interferometer using bandpass multilayers in reflection and transmission geometry and discuss its advantages and limitations. We demonstrate that our setup can probe a considerable range of neutron-mirror neutron mixing parameters allowing us to show the existence of mirror matter using present day neutron sources based on fission or spallation processes.

### [20] [Tri-Resonant Leptogenesis in a Non-Holomorphic Modular A$_4$ Scotogenic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17243)
*Tapender,Surender Verma*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores low-scale baryogenesis through tri-resonant leptogenesis in a scotogenic model with non-holomorphic modular A4 symmetry, featuring three nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos. It shows baryogenesis is achievable for both neutrino mass hierarchies with RH neutrino masses as low as ~500 GeV, testable by future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility of low-scale baryogenesis within a model that naturally accommodates three nearly-degenerate right-handed neutrinos using A4 symmetry and modular invariants, while addressing CP violation and neutrino oscillation parameters.

Method: The model incorporates non-holomorphic modular A4 symmetry with RH neutrinos in triplet representation. The Majorana mass matrix's perturbative triplet contribution creates near-degeneracy. Generalized CP symmetry restricts CP violation sources to modulus τ. Tri-resonant leptogenesis calculations include flavor effects for NH and IH mass hierarchies.

Result: For inverted hierarchy, θ23 predicted in lower octant near maximal, with CP phase δ_CP and Majorana phase α21 near 0°/360°. Predicted m_ee and total mass sum are testable via 0νββ decay and DESI+BAO (which excludes IH). Baryogenesis succeeds for NH (mass degeneracy 1e-7-1e-6) and IH (1e-8) with low RH neutrino masses (~500 GeV). NH allows tri-resonant enhancement even in high washout regimes.

Conclusion: This setup provides a testable low-scale baryogenesis mechanism with minimal RH neutrino masses, validated by current data and foreseeable experimental constraints. Future neutrino experiments and cosmological surveys will critically test the model's predictions, particularly ruling out IH scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate low-scale baryogenesis \textit{via} tri-resonant leptogenesis within the scotogenic model with a scalar dark matter embedded in non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry framework. The model naturally accommodates three nearly degenerate right-handed (RH) neutrinos when they are assigned to the triplet representation of $A_4$. The near degeneracy originates from treating the symmetric contribution to the Majorana mass matrix, arising from the $\mathbf{3}\otimes\mathbf{3}$ decomposition of $A_4$, as a small perturbation to the dominant singlet contribution. Generalized CP (gCP) symmetry is imposed in the model, rendering the complex modulus $τ$ as the sole source of CP violation. In particular, for the inverted hierarchy (IH), the predicted $3σ$ range of $θ_{23}$ lies in the lower octant close to maximal value while CP phase $δ_{\mathrm{CP}}$ and the Majorana phase $α_{21}$ are predicted to lie close to $0^\circ$ or $360^\circ$. Also, in this case, predicted values of $m_{ee}$ and $\sum_i m_i$ can be tested and constrained by future neutrinoless double beta decay $(0νββ)$ experiments, as well as by cosmological observations, particularly DESI+BAO and Planck data. In fact DESI+BAO disallows IH in the model. We further show that successful baryogenesis can be achieved for both normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) of light neutrino masses with RH neutrino masses as low as $537~\mathrm{GeV}$ rendering this scenario experimentally testable. For NH, RH neutrino mass degeneracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7}\!-\!10^{-6})$ is required, while for IH a stronger degeneracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-8})$ is needed. Remarkably, in the NH case, successful baryogenesis can occur even in the deep washout regime with decay parameters of $\mathcal{O}(10^{5})$ owing to the tri-resonant enhancement of the CP asymmetry and the inclusion of flavor effects.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a ferromagnet lattice magnetometer to enhance sensitivity for detecting ultralight dark matter (ULDM) by leveraging coherent combination of multiple levitated ferromagnets, managing dipole interactions, and improving noise properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome sensitivity limitations of single-ferromagnet systems in detecting ULDM by increasing total polarized spin without compromising dynamical response.

Method: Proposes a lattice arrangement of levitated ferromagnets, uses high-frequency magnetic fields to suppress dipole-dipole interactions, and employs collective readout to optimize noise scaling. Analyzes signal and noise properties under different dark matter couplings.

Result: Shows that the lattice approach achieves superior sensitivity compared to single ferromagnets, especially for axion-photon interactions where a lattice-induced signal enhancement occurs, surpassing existing constraints across a broad mass range.

Conclusion: The ferromagnet lattice magnetometer significantly improves ULDM detection capabilities, offering a scalable and sensitive platform for future dark matter experiments.

Abstract: A levitated ferromagnet provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) through measuring weak magnetic-like field signals. We propose a ferromagnet lattice magnetometer that coherently combines multiple levitated ferromagnets to enhance effective sensitivity. By replacing a single ferromagnet with a lattice, we increase the total polarized spin while preserving the intrinsic dynamical response of each constituent ferromagnet. We show that magnetic dipole-dipole interactions within the lattice can be dynamically suppressed through a high-frequency magnetic field, rendering the system effectively noninteracting, at the cost of only a moderate reduction in signal amplitude due to the distinct renormalization of linear and quadratic spin responses. We analyze the noise properties of the lattice and demonstrate that collective readout leads to favorable scaling with the number of ferromagnets. Interpreted in terms of axion-electron, dark photon, and axion-photon couplings, our results yield projected sensitivities that significantly exceed existing single-ferromagnet implementations. In particular, for axion-photon interactions, we find a nontrivial lattice-induced enhancement of the signal itself, leading to sensitivities that surpass existing constraints over a broad mass range.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new global determination of helicity-dependent proton PDFs using DIS, SIDIS data, and simulated EIC pseudodata, enhancing precision in sea-quark flavor separation and small-x regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision in polarized PDFs, particularly separating sea-quark flavors and reducing uncertainties at small-x, by incorporating future EIC data within a consistent NLO QCD framework.

Method: A neural-network parametrization and Monte Carlo replica method for PDF extraction, using existing DIS/SIDIS data plus simulated EIC pseudodata (two beam energies) to cover a wider kinematic range, with theoretical constraints like positivity.

Result: Significant reduction in uncertainties for quark, gluon helicity distributions, especially at small-x; better flavor separation of polarized sea-quark distributions (Δū, Δd̄, Δs).

Conclusion: EIC pseudodata greatly enhances polarized PDF precision, critical for understanding proton spin structure and guiding future experiments like the EIC itself.

Abstract: We present a new global determination of the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton, based on inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) data within a consistent next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD framework. In addition to existing measurements, we incorporate simulated pseudodata for the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), considering two beam-energy configurations, $E_e \times E_p = 5 \times 41~\mathrm{GeV^2}$ and $18 \times 275~\mathrm{GeV^2}$, corresponding to an extended kinematic reach down to $x \sim 10^{-5}$. We focus on longitudinal double-spin asymmetries $A_1^h$ for charge-separated pion and kaon production in SIDIS off a longitudinally polarized proton target. These projected measurements significantly improve the flavor separation of sea-quark polarized PDFs ($Δ\bar{u}$, $Δ\bar{d}$, $Δs$) and reduce the uncertainties on both quark and gluon helicity distributions, with the largest impact at small $x$. Polarized PDFs are extracted using a neural-network parametrization and a Monte Carlo replica methodology to propagate experimental uncertainties, while theoretical constraints such as positivity are imposed during the fit. We demonstrate that the inclusion of EIC pseudodata leads to a substantially more precise determination of polarized PDFs, with the largest impact in the small-$x$ region. The resulting polarized PDF sets are provided in the {\tt LHAPDF} format.

*Reinhard Alkofer,Christian S. Fischer,Fabian Zierler*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines light meson spectra using a Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach in QCD, exploring how varying interaction strengths affects the transition between chiral symmetric and broken regimes. It finds that simpler models show meson degeneracy over broader parameter ranges, while more realistic models have smaller ranges. Degeneracies arise from quark propagator pole locations influencing Bethe-Salpeter integrals, with implications for dynamical symmetry emergence near QCD's crossover temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the transition mechanism between chiral symmetric and broken phases in QCD vacuums, and to explore how meson spectra degeneracies reflect underlying symmetries, particularly the conjectured chiral spin symmetry near crossover temperatures.

Method: The study uses a Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter equation framework, varying interaction strengths in three quark-antiquark models. It analyzes quark propagator pole positions relative to Bethe-Salpeter integration domains to determine meson spectrum degeneracies.

Result: Simpler models exhibit degenerate meson spectra over large parameter domains, while more sophisticated models show smaller domains. Degeneracy lifting is linked to pole locations - when poles lie inside the integration domain, degeneracies are resolved, supporting symmetry emergence ideas.

Conclusion: The findings highlight how quark-gluon interaction complexity influences meson spectrum behavior, providing evidence that symmetry emergence (like chiral spin symmetry) near QCD crossover temperatures could stem from pole-position-dependent Bethe-Salpeter solutions.

Abstract: Light meson spectra are studied in a Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach to QCD. By varying the interaction strength of three sets of models for the quark-antiquark interaction, the transition from the chiral symmetric to the chirally broken regime in the vacuum is studied. The simplest type of these models leads to degenerate meson spectra for a large domain of the strength parameter. The more sophisticated and thus more realistic models show significantly smaller parameter domains for which degenerate meson spectra are obtained. The underlying mechanism for obtaining and then lifting degeneracies is traced back to the location of the quark propagators' poles, in particular, whether they are beyond or within the domain of integration in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. In view of this mechanism the potential relation of the obtained degeneracies to the dynamical emergence of symmetries is discussed, adding thereby another point of view on the conjectured chiral spin symmetry of QCD in the temperature domain right above the crossover.

Motivation: Extending the Standard Model's scalar sector allows exploration of physics beyond the SM. A muon collider offers a unique environment to study Higgs pair production and test extended Higgs sectors.

Method: Analysis of Higgs pair production via μ⁺μ⁻ annihilation in the 3HDM, focusing on neutral scalar states. Benchmark scenarios with b\bar{b}b\bar{b} and b\bar{b}t\bar{t} final states were studied using cut-and-count analysis at √s=3 TeV.

Result: Neutral scalar states (200-400 GeV) can be discovered with 5σ significance using 1-4 ab⁻¹ integrated luminosity. The muon collider is shown to be a sensitive probe for extended Higgs sectors.

Abstract: Extending the scalar sector of the Standard Model is a well-motivated approach to exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of the Three Higgs Doublet Model at a future muon collider. The scalar spectrum of the 3HDM comprises three CP-even Higgs bosons, two CP-odd Higgs bosons, and a pair of charged Higgs states. Focusing on Higgs pair production via muon-antimuon annihilation, we study the production and decay of neutral scalar states through the process $μ^+μ^- \to φ_i φ_j$, assuming a mass hierarchy in which the SM-like CP-even Higgs is the lightest state. We analyze several benchmark scenarios leading to $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ and $b\bar{b}t\bar{t}$ final states, and perform a cut-and-count analysis at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV. Our results demonstrate that a future muon collider provides a sensitive and promising environment to probe extended Higgs sectors, with neutral scalar states in the mass range of $200-400$ GeV being discoverable with $5σ$ significance for integrated luminosities of $\mathcal{O}(1-4 \ \mathrm{ab}^{-1})$.

*Soham Banerjee,Samapan Bhadury,Wojciech Florkowski,Amaresh Jaiswal,Radoslaw Ryblewski*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a common mechanism linking spin polarization of Λ hyperons and alignment of vector mesons ($φ$ and $K^{*0}$) in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, finding correlated trends but noting quantitative discrepancies with data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if a unified framework can explain both the longitudinal spin polarization of Λ hyperons and the alignment of vector mesons in RHIC collisions, addressing possible shared underlying physics mechanisms.

Method: Incorporates a common local spin equilibrium concept into a thermal model of particle production, analyzing polarization and alignment trends as functions of transverse momentum and collision centrality.

Result: Shows that the effective spin polarization tensor explaining Λ polarization also predicts monotonic increases in vector meson alignment with transverse momentum and centrality, mirroring data. However, model underpredicts some observations.

Conclusion: Suggests a potential common mechanism but highlights the need for more detailed studies to quantitatively reconcile model predictions with experimental data.

Abstract: The concept of a common local spin equilibrium for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles is incorporated into a thermal model of particle production in heavy-ion collisions at the top RHIC energies. We show that an effective spin polarization tensor leading to a correct description of the longitudinal spin polarization of $Λ$ hyperons simultaneously yields a positive alignment of vector mesons ($φ$ and $K^{*0}$) that grows monotonically with transverse momentum and centrality. Similar trends can be seen in the data, suggesting a possible common mechanism for longitudinal spin polarization and alignment. However, model calculations are insufficient to explain the data in a fully quantitative way. The correlation found between the magnitude of the $Λ$ longitudinal polarization and vector meson alignment suggests further more elaborate investigations of this issue.

*D. Subotić,H. Jung,A. V. Kotikov,N. Raičević*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses the PDF2ISR framework to analyze Drell-Yan lepton pair transverse-momentum spectra at small p_T, addressing non-perturbative QCD effects like intrinsic parton transverse momentum and soft-gluon radiation. Key technical aspects like remnant recoil and low-scale α_s behavior were rigorously tested against data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe non-perturbative QCD effects in small-p_T Drell-Yan spectra and assess the impact of different theoretical approaches on consistency with experimental data.

Method: Employ the PDF2ISR framework to systematically account for intrinsic parton p_T, initial-state soft gluon radiation, and remnant recoil schemes. Investigate α_s treatment at low scales, comparing predictions with experimental data.

Result: Detailed analysis validated PDF2ISR's capability to handle non-perturbative effects. Study showed sensitivity of experimental results to α_s low-scale behavior choices, providing benchmarks for future comparisons.

Conclusion: PDF2ISR offers a robust method for studying small-p_T Drell-Yan processes, highlighting the importance of accurate non-perturbative QCD modeling and α_s parameterization at low scales for precise phenomenological predictions.

Abstract: The transverse-momentum spectrum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs at small $p_T$ probes non-perturbative QCD effects, including intrinsic partonic transverse momentum and initial-state soft-gluon radiation. The novel approach PDF2ISR is employed to study the transverse-momentum spectrum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs in the small-$p_T(\ell\ell)$ region. This framework is particularly well suited for such investigations, as it provides a systematic treatment of the dominant non-perturbative effects and their interplay. In order to extract robust physical conclusions, a detailed analysis of the technical aspects involved in the simulation of the intrinsic transverse momenta of partons inside the proton, as well as the remnant recoil schemes, was carried out. Furthermore, different approaches for the treatment of the strong coupling at low scales were investigated and confronted with available experimental data. This comparison enabled an assessment of the sensitivity of the experimental measurements to the chosen low-scale behaviour of $α_s$.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: RMM-C46 is a compact physics-driven event representation that reduces the high-dimensional RMM into 46 interpretable features, enabling efficient use in machine learning and quantum computing while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges posed by the high-dimensional RMM (over a thousand values per event) which is too resource-heavy for large-scale ML training and quantum devices, while preserving physical interpretability.

Method: Aggregates the RMM's physical block structure using invariant mass, rapidity difference, and transverse energy components to create a low-dimensional (46 features) representation. Tested on simulated 13.6 TeV proton-proton collisions.

Result: RMM-C46 matches or exceeds the discriminative performance of the full RMM in ML tasks (both supervised and unsupervised), while reducing the input size by over 10x. It's stable, interpretable, and compatible with quantum computing architectures.

Conclusion: RMM-C46 offers a scalable, efficient, and quantum-ready alternative to the full RMM for high-energy physics analyses, bridging the gap between complex physics data and computational limitations.

Abstract: We introduce a compact, physics-driven event representation, RMM-C46, designed to compress the high-dimensional rapidity mass matrix (RMM) into a low-dimensional, interpretable feature set suitable for physics-informed machine learning (ML) and quantum computing applications. The full RMM encodes detailed pairwise correlations among jets, b-jets, leptons, photons, and missing transverse energy but contains more than a thousand values per event, making it computationally heavy for large-scale training and incompatible with current low-qubit quantum devices. The proposed RMM-C46 input space for ML preserves the physical block structure of the RMM through aggregated invariant mass, rapidity difference, and transverse energy components, reducing the size of the original RMM by over an order of magnitude while maintaining interpretability. Applied to simulated proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, these representations match or exceed the discriminative performance of the full RMM in both supervised and unsupervised ML tasks. Their compactness, stability, and physics transparency also make them naturally compatible with near-term quantum machine learning architectures. RMM-C46 provides a scalable, efficient, and quantum-ready alternative to the full RMM for next-generation collider physics analyses.

*Sreemanti Chakraborti*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper reviews ultralight axion-like particles (ALPs) as dark matter candidates, focusing on their classical signatures and experimental strategies involving precision/quantum technologies. It covers ALP interactions with Standard Model fields, various experimental methods (haloscopes, helioscopes, clocks, interferometers), and the role of coherence/noise in their sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore ultralight ALPs as coherent dark matter fields and evaluate how precision/quantum experiments can detect their time-dependent effects through different interaction channels and technologies.

Method: The paper uses an effective field theory framework to analyze ALP-Standard Model interactions, categorizes experiments by their detection mechanisms (conversion-based vs. oscillation-sensitive), and discusses technical factors (coherence, bandwidth, noise) affecting sensitivity.

Result: Highlights the broad parameter space coverage by combining conversion-based searches (haloscopes/helioscopes) with precision experiments (clocks, interferometers). Demonstrates complementary strengths across ALP mass ranges and the growing discovery potential of current实验 programs.

Conclusion: Ultralight ALP dark matter can be effectively probed through a多元化实验策略, combining classical field descriptions with advanced technologies. The synergies between different experiments enhance coverage and discovery prospects in this field.

Abstract: We review the physics of ultralight axion-like particles (ALPs) as dark matter candidates and the experimental strategies used to search for them with precision and quantum technologies. In the ultralight regime, the enormous occupation number of the dark matter field motivates a classical description in terms of a coherently oscillating background, leading to distinctive, time-dependent signatures in laboratory observables. We discuss the effective field theory framework governing ALP interactions with Standard Model fields, and show how different operators give rise to qualitatively different experimental signals. The lecture notes cover both conversion-based searches enabled by the axion-photon coupling, such as haloscopes and helioscopes, and precision experiments sensitive to oscillations of fundamental constants and material properties. These include atomic and nuclear clocks, optical cavities, laser and unequal time-delay interferometers, and mechanical or solid state resonators. Emphasis is placed on the physical origin of the sensitivity of each platform, the role of coherence, bandwidth, and noise, and the complementarity between different technologies across a wide range of ALP masses. Together, these approaches provide broad and overlapping coverage of ultralight dark matter parameter space and define a rapidly evolving experimental programme with strong discovery potential.

### [29] [Stochastic galactic supernova flux of semi-relativistic particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17597)
*David Alonso-González,David Cerdeño,Marina Cermeño,Andres D. Perez*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the flux of semi-relativistic exotic particles like axion-like particles or light dark matter emitted by core-collapse supernovae, showing that their galactic diffuse flux is highly non-smooth due to stochastic SN distributions and short detector exposure times, leading to energy-dependent fluctuations that invalidate smooth flux approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critique the existing assumption that supernova-emitted particles form a smooth diffuse flux on Earth, and explore the actual energy-dependent variability caused by stochastic supernova distributions and detector time constraints.

Method: Numerical simulation of galactic supernova history to model particle packet overlaps, intensity variations based on SN distances, and energy ranges detectable within short observational windows.

Result: The resultant flux is not smooth but exhibits significant energy-dependent fluctuations due to stochastic SN events and limited observation times, leading to weaker experimental constraints on particles like axion-like particles and fermionic dark matter.

Conclusion: Terrestrial experiments must account for stochastic galactic flux variations rather than smooth approximations, and previous constraints on exotic particles may be overly pessimistic.

Abstract: New exotic particles with MeV masses, such as axion-like particles or light dark matter, can be emitted from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with semi-relativistic velocities. Due to their speed dispersion, they would arrive at Earth as an extended packet with a time spread that can be as large as tens of millennia for typical detectors. It has been argued in the literature that the superposition of packets from all galactic SNe would give rise to a smooth and stationary diffuse flux that could be observable on terrestrial experiments. In this article, we critically examine this hypothesis by carrying out a numerical simulation of the galactic history of SN explosions. We show that, although the particle packets do overlap, due to the short observational time window, each of them only contributes with a very narrow range of energies and with an intensity that depends on the SN distance. As a consequence, the energy dependence of the resulting flux is extremely sensitive to the stochastic nature of the SN population and far from smooth. This has profound implications for the expected signature in terrestrial experiments, which displays a spectral shape that is not properly described by the smooth approximation. We develop a numerical tool to compute this stochastic galactic flux for generic semi-relativistic particles, which also allows us to explore sub-MeV particles, where the smooth diffuse flux approach does not hold. To test this framework, we revisit existing bounds on axion-like particles and fermionic dark matter, finding weaker constraints than previously reported.

### [30] [Light dark sector via thermal decays of Dark Matter: the case of a 17 MeV particle coupled to electrons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17620)
*Marco Graziani*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The thesis explores whether a proposed 17 MeV boson (X₁₇), suggested by experiments like ATOMKI and PADME, could act as a mediator linking the Standard Model to hidden sectors, potentially explaining dark matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observed anomalies in nuclear transitions (ATOMKI) and positron annihilation (PADME) point to a new 17 MeV resonance, motivating the investigation into its role as a mediator connecting visible and hidden sectors to address dark matter.

Method: Analyzes experimental data from ATOMKI and PADME, considers MEG II constraints, and evaluates the X₁₇ boson's theoretical compatibility with Standard Model extensions and hidden sector interactions.

Result: Proposes that X₁₇ could serve as a mediator between Standard Model particles and dark matter, offering a potential solution to the dark matter problem if confirmed.

Conclusion: While indirect evidence supports X₁₇'s existence, further experimental verification is needed to confirm its properties and role in dark matter mediation.

Abstract: Recent experimental observations, most notably those reported by the ATOMKI and Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment (PADME) collaborations, have hinted anomalies that may indicate the presence of a new resonance with a mass around $17\,\text{MeV}$, potentially interacting with both nucleons and electrons. Since 2020, ATOMKI has observed this resonance in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in ${}^{8}\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$. More recently, in 2025, PADME, operating at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, has also hinted a similar excess, in this case in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ final-state events originating from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons of Carbonium. This concordance strengthens the case for a common underlying origin, potentially involving a new boson, conventionally referred to as $X_{17}$.
  Despite these intriguing developments, the global experimental landscape remains highly dynamic, particularly in light of recent MEG~II constraints, and a definitive confirmation or exclusion of the $X_{17}$ hypothesis is still lacking. Within this evolving and exciting context, this thesis investigates whether a hypothetical $17\,\text{MeV}$ particle, coupled to electrons as suggested by the PADME observations, could function as a mediator between the Standard Model and previously unexplored hidden sectors. Such a mediator could, in principle, offer a novel pathway toward addressing one of the principal outstanding inconsistencies of the Standard Model: the nature and origin of dark matter.

### [31] [Revisiting the Higgs-mass calculation in the scale-invariant THDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17643)
*Pietro Slavich*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper revisits the one-loop calculation of the Higgs mass spectrum in a scale-invariant Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (THDM), identifying flaws in prior effective-potential approaches. It shows significant (~10%) corrections to Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Higgs masses and non-negligible mixing between SM-like and BSM Higgs states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct earlier miscalculations in the THDM Higgs mass predictions by addressing errors in the effective-potential method and providing accurate one-loop corrections.

Method: Direct computation of Feynman diagrams for one-loop corrections in a scale-invariant THDM, contrasting with previous effective-potential approaches.

Result: One-loop corrections cause ~10% shifts in BSM Higgs masses and induce substantial mixing between SM-like and BSM neutral scalars.

Conclusion: Prior results using effective-potential methods are unreliable; precise calculations are essential for accurate THDM predictions, especially regarding mass spectra and mixing effects.

Abstract: We revisit the one-loop calculation of the Higgs mass spectrum of the scale-invariant THDM, relying on a direct calculation of the relevant Feynman diagrams. We highlight a number of incorrect assumptions in earlier calculations that relied on the effective-potential approach. In contrast with the earlier findings, we show that the one-loop corrections can have an effect of ${\cal O}(10\%)$ on the predictions for the BSM-Higgs masses, and they can also induce non-negligible mixing between the SM-like and BSM states in the neutral-scalar sector.

*Ren Tsuda,Ryotaku Suzuki,Shinya Tomizawa*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper constructs higher-dimensional regular Fan-Wang-type black holes in quasi-topological gravity without matter fields, using higher-curvature corrections to ensure regularity, even for negative masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the Fan-Wang solution beyond four dimensions and Einstein gravity, achieving spacetime regularity without matter fields by leveraging higher-curvature terms in quasi-topological gravity.

Method: 1. Extend the Fan-Wang model to higher dimensions in QTG framework. 2. Derive solutions by calculating coupling constants for each curvature order. 3. Ensure spacetime regularity through curvature terms instead of nonlinear electrodynamics.

Result: Successful construction of asymptotically flat regular black holes with a regular center in arbitrary higher dimensions. Negative mass solutions remain regular, a stark difference from Einstein gravity.

Conclusion: Quasi-topological gravity provides a novel mechanism to achieve regular black holes via higher-curvature terms, offering new insights into quantum gravity effects and black hole physics beyond general relativity.

Abstract: We construct a class of regular black hole solutions of the Fan-Wang type within quasi-topological gravity (QTG) in arbitrary spacetime dimensions greater than four. In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We analyze late-time cosmological dynamics in f(Q) gravity with a bulk viscous fluid, showing it provides a viable alternative to ΛCDM for explaining cosmic acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore beyond the standard dust approximation and ΛCDM model by incorporating bulk viscosity and f(Q) gravity effects in cosmic evolution.

Method: Derived background equations for f(Q) gravity with bulk viscosity, used observational data (CC, DESI BAO, supernovae) to constrain parameters, applied statefinder/Om diagnostics, and analyzed deceleration/equation-of-state evolution.

Result: The model shows a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion, consistent with observations, and distinguishes from ΛCDM through diagnostics.

Conclusion: Bulk viscosity in f(Q) gravity offers a viable framework for late-time cosmic acceleration, observationally matching and theoretically extending standard models.

Abstract: We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a spatially flat FLRW universe in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar. The matter sector is modeled as a bulk viscous fluid with a free equation-of-state parameter $γ$, allowing for a generalized description of cosmic matter beyond the standard dust approximation. We derive the background evolution equations and analyze the resulting expansion history. The model parameters are constrained using a combination of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and Type~Ia supernovae (GRBs and Union3). Using the best-fit parameters, we further employ the statefinder and $\mathrm{Om}(z)$ diagnostics to distinguish the viscous $f(Q)$ scenario from the standard $Λ$CDM model. In addition, we examine the evolution of the deceleration parameter, which exhibits a transition from an early decelerated phase to the current accelerated expansion, and analyze the effective equation of state behavior. Our results show that bulk viscosity within $f(Q)$ gravity provides a viable and observationally consistent description of late-time cosmic acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To construct theories allowing second-order equations of motion on spherically symmetric backgrounds while finding vacuum solutions that describe regular black holes without singularities.

Method: Starting from subclasses of two-dimensional Horndeski actions, the authors build four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities. They focus on non-polynomial quasi-topological gravities which yield algebraic equations for the metric function, enabling exact solutions.

Result: Single-function static spherically symmetric solutions are obtained, including the Hayward regular black hole spacetime. The corresponding gravitational action for Hayward's solution is explicitly provided.

Conclusion: Non-polynomial quasi-topological gravities provide a framework to study regular black holes with well-behaved equations of motion, offering insights into singularity-free black hole solutions in modified gravity theories.

Abstract: We derive static spherically symmetric regular black holes as vacuum solutions to purely gravitational theories in four dimensions. To that end, we construct four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities starting from subclasses of two-dimensional Horndeski actions. By construction, these theories possess second-order equations of motion on spherically symmetric backgrounds. We show that a subset of these non-polynomial gravities, referred to as non-polynomial quasi-topological gravities, admit single-function static spherically symmetric solutions whereby the metric function is determined by an algebraic equation. Solutions to these theories include the Hayward regular black-hole spacetime, for which a corresponding gravitational action is stated explicitly.

TL;DR: The study examines how Dehnen-type dark matter halos affect black hole spacetime characteristics, finding that halo parameters significantly influence strong-field observables like shadow radius and orbital instability, with effects dependent on density profile steepness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dark matter halos modify black hole properties and their observable signatures, addressing gaps in previous models that may oversimplify halo structures.

Method: Analyzing two analytic models of black holes with Dehnen-type halos, studying geodesics, photon spheres, shadows, Lyapunov exponents, ISCO frequencies, binding energies, and Hawking temperatures through corrected numerical simulations.

Result: Halo scale parameters reduce characteristic radii, increase orbital instability, and boost accretion efficiency for moderate density slopes. Steeper density profiles yield minimal deviations from Schwarzschild black holes.

Conclusion: Dark matter halo parameters critically control optical and dynamical signatures of black holes, emphasizing the importance of considering density profile details in astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We investigate particle motion in regular and asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes supported by Dehnen-type dark-matter halos. Two analytic models are analyzed, allowing a systematic study of circular geodesics, photon-sphere properties, shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, ISCO frequency, binding energy, and Hawking temperature. The corrected numerical results show that the halo scale parameter can significantly modify strong-field observables. In both models, for moderate density slopes, increasing the halo parameter reduces characteristic radii while enhancing orbital instability and accretion efficiency. For steeper density falloff, however, deviations from the Schwarzschild case remain small. These results demonstrate that halo-induced modifications of optical and dynamical black hole signatures are strongly controlled by the density profile parameters.

Motivation: Extending General Relativity solutions to multigravity and studying how classical double copy relations apply in this framework to understand gravitational dynamics and field interactions.

Method: Deriving exact solutions via proportional and double Kerr-Schild forms, extending existing GR solutions with constant Ricci scalar parameters into multigravity, and analyzing the dynamics of single-copy and zero-copy fields through these solutions.

Result: Successfully derived new multigravity solutions using specified Kerr-Schild forms, demonstrated extension of GR solutions, and provided insights into double copy relations involving gravitational and non-gravitational fields.

Conclusion: Multigravity theory can accommodate exact solutions analogous to GR while enriching the understanding of double copy mechanisms, offering a pathway for future exploration in gravitational theories and gauge field interplay.

Abstract: We explore the multimetric theory of gravitation, also known as multigravity. We derive additional new exact solutions for the theory in proportional Kerr-Schild and double Kerr-Schild forms. We extend several solutions from the theory of General Relativity, characterized by a constant Ricci scalar in single and double Kerr-Schild forms, to derive solutions in the multi-gravity context. We also examine and extend the classical double copy relations that can be constructed out from these solutions in multigravity exploring the dynamics of the single copy and zero copy fields.

*Hideyasu Yamashita*

TL;DR: The paper examines empirical laws for Majorana fields in curved spacetime, addressing observability challenges due to the absence of a vacuum state, building on previous work on Klein-Gordon fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncertainty in empirical laws in QFTCS compared to QFTM, exacerbated by the lack of a vacuum state, specifically for Majorana fields.

Method: Analyzing examples of empirical laws for Majorana fields in curved spacetime, extending methods from their previous study on Klein-Gordon fields.

Result: Identifies challenges and potential empirical laws for Majorana fields, contributing to the foundations of QFTCS as a physically viable theory.

Conclusion: The study reinforces QFTCS's physical relevance by demonstrating the possibility of formulating observable empirical laws despite the absence of a vacuum state.

Abstract: This article is a sequel to our previous paper (arXiv:2511.12311), where we considered the conceptual problem on the empirical laws for the Klein\textendash Gordon quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS), and we will consider the similar problems for the Majorana field on curved spacetime here. A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws.

### [38] [Black-Hole mimickers in GR and $f(R)$ gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16916)
*Hodek M. García,Marcelo Salgado*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores solitonic boson stars (SBSs) as black hole mimickers (BHMs) and compares them to ultracompact objects in incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) models under general relativity and f(R) gravity. It investigates whether these models can surpass the Buchdahl limit and addresses stability concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if SBSs and IPFUCOs in f(R) gravity can exceed the Buchdahl limit (C=4/9) and resolve conflicting stability findings among previous studies.

Method: Analyzes static/spherically symmetric SBS solutions with sextic potentials, compares them to IPFUCOs in general relativity, and examines their properties in quadratic f(R) gravity models.

Result: IPFUCOs in general relativity reach the Buchdahl limit at C=4/9 regardless of pressure; f(R) gravity does not overcome this limit. Stability of SBSs remains unresolved but suggests certain parameter regions may support stable configurations.

Conclusion: SBSs are viable BHMs comparable to IPFUCOs, but Buchdahl limit persists in f(R) gravity. Further exploration of alternative gravity theories or other UCO types needed; stability requires more rigorous analysis.

Abstract: Black hole mimickers (BHMs) are horizonless globally regular ultracompact relativistic self-gravitating objects (UCOs) of mass $M$ and radius $R$ with compactness $C = M/R$ higher than that of a neutron star and that produce an effective potential for null geodesics (photons) that possesses a local maximum, which is usually accompanied by an inner local minimum. The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity). We further elaborate about the stability properties of SBSs which have been the subject of some controversy recently.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the propagation of massive scalar fields around regular black holes with phantom scalar hair, focusing on quasinormal modes, greybody factors, and the impact of the scalar charge A. It finds anomalous decay rates for massive scalars and critical mass dependence on charge and overtone number, with agreement between WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the regularization parameter (scalar charge A) affects wave dynamics, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors in asymptotically flat regular black holes, which eliminate the central singularity.

Method: Analyzes scalar perturbations using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit and the Horowitz-Hubeny approach. Computes reflection/transmission coefficients and greybody factors to study scattering properties.

Result: 发现了标量毛对类时模频率和阻尼率的影响，以及质量超过临界值时，寿命最长的模式对应较低角动量数。推导了临界质量的解析表达式及其与标量电荷和泛频数的依赖关系。WKB和Horowitz-Hubeny方法的结果在有效区域内高度一致。

Conclusion: Regular black holes with scalar hair展示独特的动力学特征，可通过准正常 ringing 和波传播进行探测。这些结果为通过引力波观测研究黑洞结构和标量场效应提供了新途径。

Abstract: We study the propagation of massive scalar fields in the background of asymptotically flat regular black holes supported by a phantom scalar field with a scalar charge $A$. This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation.

### [40] [Extreme-mass ratio inspirals in Schwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime I: Weak-field orbits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17154)
*John Adrian N. Villanueva,Ian Vega*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the effect of a small positive cosmological constant on the inspiral of compact objects into black holes in the weak-field regime, showing it accelerates eccentricity loss and reduces plunge times, potentially affecting event rates for detectors like LISA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models of inspiral ignore the lack of asymptotic flatness caused by environments or an expanding universe. The study fills this gap by analyzing spacetimes without asymptotic flatness, using Schwarzschild-de Sitter as a model.

Method: Analyzing Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, calculating shifts in the orbit separatrix and orbital parameter relationships. Applied a modified quadrupole formula under the assumption orbital timescale is much shorter than inspiral timescale.

Result: Cosmological constant accelerates eccentricity decay and shortens inspiral plunge times in weak-field scenarios. This could lead to revised estimates of gravitational wave event rates for space-based detectors.

Conclusion: Inclusion of cosmological effects is important for accurate modeling of gravitational wave inspiral processes, critical for future detector data interpretation.

Abstract: The inspiral of a compact object into a black hole is a key source of low-frequency gravitational waves for future space-based detectors like LISA. While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors.

### [41] [Uncovering subdominant multipole asymmetries in binary black-hole mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17343)
*Jannik Mielke,Angela Borchers,Frank Ohme*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study emphasizes the importance of subdominant gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries in accurately calculating black hole recoil velocities and their detectability by third-generation detectors. Neglecting these asymmetries can lead to significant errors (up to 210 km/s) and biases in astrophysical parameter inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models often ignore or consider only dominant multipole asymmetries due to their minimal contribution to signal strength. This limitation introduces systematic biases in recoil velocity calculations and spin geometry inference, necessitating a more comprehensive approach.

Method: The paper analyzes the role of subdominant multipole asymmetries during the inspiral and ringdown phases of black hole binaries. It identifies that during inspiral, antisymmetric frequencies relate to orbital frequency multiples, while in ringdown, they match symmetric frequencies. This insight could aid in developing improved gravitational-wave models.

Result: Neglecting subdominant asymmetries causes up to 210 km/s discrepancies in recoil velocity. Their inclusion is crucial for reducing biases in mass and spin parameter estimations. The paper also outlines universal characteristics of these asymmetries to facilitate future model development.

Conclusion: Subdominant multipole asymmetries must be incorporated into gravitational-wave models for accurate recoil velocity predictions and astrophysical parameter inference. Third-generation detectors will be essential for detecting these effects, underscoring the need for refined analytical frameworks.

Abstract: In dynamically formed binaries, the spins of the black holes tend to be misaligned with the system's orbital angular momentum. This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies.

*Jureeporn Yuennan,Farruh Atamurotov,Salvatore Capozziello,Phongpichit Channuie*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Analyzes β-exponential inflationary models with/without non-minimal coupling to align scalar spectral index ns ~0.97-0.976 and tensor ratio r <0.03, matching ACT/DESI/BICEP data better than Planck's universal attractor predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolve tension between ACT/DESI data showing higher ns than Planck 2018 by exploring modified exponential potentials in braneworld scenarios.

Method: Derive analytical expressions via perturbative expansion in non-minimal coupling ξ, complemented by numerical validation; test minimally vs non-minimally coupled β-exponential potential V(φ)=V₀(1−λβφ/Mₚ)^{1/β} for inflationary observables.

Result: Minimally coupled model gives ns≈0.976, r≈0.035 with β ~ O(1-5). Non-minimal coupling reduces r to ~0.03 while keeping ns ~0.974-0.976, matching 1σ ACT+DESI limits better, especially at N=60.

Conclusion: β-exponential potential with non-minimal coupling emerges as viable solution to inflationary parameter tension, consistent with latest CMB and BAO observations.

Abstract: Recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), especially when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ higher than the value reported by \textit{Planck} 2018, placing tension on universal inflationary attractor models. Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate the inflationary predictions of the $β$-exponential potential, $V(φ)=V_0\left(1-λβφ/M_p\right)^{1/β}$ considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled realizations. This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios. We derive analytical expressions for the slow-roll parameters and inflationary observables using a perturbative expansion in the non-minimal coupling $ξ$, and validate these results through numerical calculations. In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.976$ and $r \simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of β, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1σlevel while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction. Introducing a small non-minimal coupling significantly improves agreement with observations by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio while preserving the enhanced scalar tilt. For $N=60, λ\sim 0.3-0.5$, and $β\sim O(1-5)$, the non-minimally coupled model yields $n_s \simeq 0.974-0.976$ and $r \lesssim 0.03$, comfortably consistent with ACT, DESI, and BICEP/Keck bounds. Our results show that the $β$-exponential potential, especially when implemented with a non-minimal coupling, exhibits good agreement with the latest CMB observations. Our inflationary predictions of the non-minimal model of $n_s$ and $r$ confirming the leading-order contributions in $ξ$ are sufficient to capture the essential features of both $r$ and $n_s$ in observationally relevant regimes.

### [43] [Possible existence of super Chandrasekhar mass limit in the matter-curvature coupled gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17403)
*N. Priyobarta,S. K. Maurya,Ksh. Newton Singh,B. Mishra*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study explores deviations in the Chandrasekhar mass limit of white dwarfs using modified gravity theories f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T). Calculations show mass limits exceeding the GR/Newtonian 1.4 M☉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether modified gravity theories can account for observed super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs, addressing limitations of general relativity and Newtonian physics in explaining high-mass white dwarfs.

Method: Modified TOV equations derived for f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity with three functional forms, using degenerate electron gas equation of state. Mass-radius relations computed and stability criteria analyzed.

Result: Theoretical models predict higher mass limits (up to 2.08 M☉ for exponential f(R,L_m)), significant density-dependent variations, and stable configurations confirmed via adiabatic indices. Observables like redshift and compactness align with white dwarf characteristics.

Conclusion: Modified gravity offers a viable framework to explain super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs, with exponential forms allowing extreme masses - challenging classical limits and suggesting new astrophysical implications.

Abstract: We investigate white dwarfs in the framework of f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity to explore the Chandrasekhar Limit. We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\,\mathrm{M}_\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\,\mathrm{M}_\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\,\mathrm{M}_\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (ρ_c > 10^{10}\, \mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases.

### [44] [Inspiral tests of general relativity and waveform geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17524)
*Brian C. Seymour,Jacob Golomb,Yanbei Chen*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that parameterized tests, using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism and geometric analysis, are robust in detecting deviations from general relativity in gravitational wave data. It introduces template optimization via SVD to identify degeneracies and enhance detection of GR violations, while clarifying how different effects can mimic or be distinguished from each other.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of parameterized tests in identifying unmodeled deviations from GR and to understand how waveform geometries influence bias and distinguishability in gravitational wave signals.

Method: The authors apply the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism, use singular value decomposition to design orthogonal templates, and analyze the signal manifold geometry to study biases and degeneracies in gravitational wave parameter estimation.

Result: Parameterized tests show flexibility and sensitivity in detecting generic GR deviations. The geometric framework reveals how biases arise, degeneracies can be mitigated, and different physical effects (eccentricity, spins, glitches) can either mimic or be distinguished through waveform geometry analysis.

Conclusion: The developed geometric framework provides a foundational understanding of gravitational wave analysis, enabling improved detection of GR deviations and clarifying conditions under which subtle effects are distinguishable. This approach enhances parameter estimation robustness against systematic errors and unmodeled signals.

Abstract: The phase evolution of gravitational waves encodes critical information about the orbital dynamics of binary systems. In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity. We demonstrate that these parameterized tests are flexible and sensitive in detecting generic deviations in the waveform using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism. This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable.

*José Barrientos,Adolfo Cisterna,Amaro Díaz,Keanu Müller*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents new vacuum solutions of Einstein equations derived from electrovacuum configurations in external electromagnetic fields, using magnetization and inversion symmetry methods, resulting in Petrov type I spacetimes and novel vacuum geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore methods for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries in General Relativity and demonstrate how electromagnetic embeddings can create non-trivial vacuum metrics through gravitational backreaction.

Method: Two mechanisms applied to accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes: Melvin--Bonnor magnetization and Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. The electromagnetic fields are removed while retaining gravitational effects, leading to new vacuum spacetimes.

Result: Discovery of accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I, with the magnetized Schwarzschild case matching known results and inversion symmetry producing a new configuration. Appendices include stationary generalizations and additional static vacuums using the Alekseev--García seed.

Conclusion: Electromagnetic embeddings combined with symmetries provide a robust method for constructing diverse vacuum solutions, expanding the toolkit for studying gravitational phenomena in algebraically complex geometries.

Abstract: We construct new vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations generated from electrovacuum configurations embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds. Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--García black hole as the seed.

*Francesco Nobili,Malvina Bellotti,Riccardo Buscicchio,Massimo Dotti,Alessandro Lupi*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast algorithm for detecting and characterizing massive black hole binaries using LISA data, enabling real-time alerts and improved parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable timely detection of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) in LISA data hours to weeks before merger, allowing for coordinated multi-messenger observations and accurate parameter estimation.

Method: The method uses a chirping time-frequency morphology search in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms, tiling the time-frequency plane with slices based on quadrupole frequency evolution. It identifies triggers consistent with the same signal using a coherence tracker, refining chirp mass and coalescence time estimates.

Result: Successfully detected all 15 injected MBHBs in the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, with 14 detected pre-merger. Achieved chirp mass errors <3% for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties within a few hours, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The algorithm is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time alerts, enabling timely observational follow-ups and providing priors for Bayesian analysis, enhancing LISA's scientific impact.

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to observe gravitational waves from massive black hole binaries across cosmic time. Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation.

### [47] [Status of the STIS Auto-wavecal Exposures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16946)
*D. Welty,S. Lockwood*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the behavior of default wavecal spectra used for calibrating STIS spectroscopic data, addressing lamp fading and exposure times. It concludes that increasing exposure times for short-wavelength settings will improve calibration accuracy as lamps degrade.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maintain accurate wavelength calibrations as Pt/Cr-Ne lamps fade, especially at short wavelengths, the authors evaluate current wavecal effectiveness and assess needed changes.

Method: The study examines SHIFTA1/SHIFTA2 values from wavecal data, revisits lamp fading trends, and performs simulations to estimate optimal exposure times for reliable spectral offsets.

Result: Current wavecals provide reasonable SHIFTA values, but simulations show increased exposure times are necessary for short-wavelength settings to ensure stable wavelength zero points as lamps continue to fade.

Conclusion: Recommendations include adjusting default exposure times for certain spectra to counteract lamp fading, ensuring sustained calibration accuracy over time.

Abstract: We discuss the behavior of the default ``wavecal'' spectra obtained together with most STIS spectroscopic exposures, which are needed for proper wavelength calibration of the science data. Because the Pt/Cr-Ne lamps used for the wavecals have been fading (especially at the shortest wavelengths), some changes in the default lamp and/or exposure time have been implemented in recent years to maintain accurate calibrations. To assess whether additional changes might be appropriate, we examine the distribution of the SHIFTA1, SHIFTA2 values derived from the wavecals (the x and y offsets of the spectral image on the detector), we re-visit the wavelength-dependent fading of the lamps, and we perform simulations to estimate the exposure times that would be needed to obtain accurate SHIFTA values. While the current wavecals do appear to yield reasonable SHIFTA, increases in the default exposure times for some of the shortest-wavelength settings would help to ensure reliable wavelength zero points as the lamps continue to fade.

*N. Galikyan,A. A. Kocharyan,V. G. Gurzadyan*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper uses the Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) to analyze the randomness of white noise in NANOGrav pulsar timing data, revealing inhomogeneities among pulsars and non-stationary processes influencing the signals. KSP serves as a tool to assess timing model accuracy and identify contributions from stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the randomness of white noise in pulsar timing data and detect non-stationary physical processes affecting these signals, which helps in refining timing models and understanding stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds.

Method: Analyzing the time of arrival (TOA) data of 68 pulsars using KSP to quantify randomness, assess temporal variations in randomness, and compare observed data with timing models.

Result: KSP revealed varying degrees of randomness among pulsars, highlighted inhomogeneities in white noise, and indicated non-stationary processes in the data. It also demonstrated the parameter's effectiveness in testing model accuracy and detecting gravitational wave contributions.

Conclusion: KSP is a valuable tool for assessing randomness in pulsar timing data, identifying model discrepancies, and probing physical processes contributing to stochastic signals, emphasizing its role in gravitational wave astronomy research.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) as a sensitive descriptor of degree of randomness of signals is used to analyze the properties of the NANOGrav pulsar timing data associated to a stochastic gravitational wave background. The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars are analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.

*Yuduo Guo,Hao Zhang,Mingyu Li,Fujiang Yu,Yunjing Wu,Yuhan Hao,Song Huang,Yongming Liang,Xiaojing Lin,Xinyang Li,Jiamin Wu,Zheng Cai,Qionghai Dai*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: ASTERIS is an innovative self-supervised transformer-based denoising method that integrates spatiotemporal data across exposures to reduce noise in astronomical images. It significantly enhances detection limits, preserves image quality, and discovers previously undetectable celestial features like faint galaxies and lensed arcs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Astronomical imaging's detection limits are constrained by correlated noise across pixels and exposures, which existing methods fail to fully address. There's a need for algorithms that leverage both spatial and temporal noise correlations to improve detection sensitivity while maintaining photometric accuracy.

Method: ASTERIS uses a self-supervised transformer architecture to process multi-exposure data, capturing spatiotemporal noise patterns. It learns correlations between neighboring pixels and sequential exposures without labeled data, enabling effective noise correction while preserving critical astrophysical features.

Result: Benchmark tests show ASTERIS improves detection by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness/purity, maintains point spread function integrity, and photometric accuracy. Applied to JWST/Subaru data, it detects triple the redshift >9 galaxy candidates (1.0 mag fainter) and reveals low-surface-brightness structures and lensed arcs unseen before.

Conclusion: ASTERIS demonstrates transformative potential for deep-space imaging, enabling discoveries of faint and distant celestial objects by significantly enhancing observational sensitivity. It advances astronomical data analysis by effectively managing correlated noise across spatiotemporal domains without compromising image fidelity.

Abstract: The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift > 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.
