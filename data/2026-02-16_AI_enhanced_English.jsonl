In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization.

We present a feature-based photometric classifier for SNe detected by ZTF, with the primary goal of constructing a photometric SN Ia sample for cosmological analyses.

Additionally, current machine learning-based inference methods are typically limited to estimating scalar parameters in a multidimensional space rather than full differential distributions. We propose a general framework for Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) that efficiently profiles nuisance parameters while measuring multivariate Distributions of Interest (DoI), defined as learnable invertible transformations of the feature space. We introduce Factorizable Normalizing Flows to model systematic variations as parametric deformations of a nominal density, preserving tractability without combinatorial explosion. Crucially, we develop an amortized training strategy that learns the conditional dependence of the DoI on nuisance parameters in a single optimization process, bypassing the need for repetitive training during the likelihood scan. This allows for the simultaneous extraction of the underlying distribution and the robust profiling of nuisances. The method is validated on a synthetic dataset emulating a high-energy physics measurement with multiple systematic sources, demonstrating its potential for unbinned, functional measurements in complex analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a new Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework that efficiently profiles nuisance parameters while measuring multivariate distributions by using Factorizable Normalizing Flows and amortized training, validated on a synthetic high-energy physics dataset.", "motivation": "Traditional unbinned likelihood methods are computationally expensive for profiling systematic uncertainties, and existing ML methods are limited to scalar parameters rather than full distributions.", "method": "The framework uses Factorizable Normalizing Flows to model systematic variations as parametric deformations of a nominal density, allowing for tractable computation.

In the early universe the observed relic of the sterile neutrino DM is generated via the \\textit{Dodelson-Widrow} mechanism. However, this production scenario is severely constraint by various astrophysical observations. Many non-standard interactions between active ($\u03bd_a$) and sterile ($\u03bd_s$) neutrino have been proposed to evade these astrophysical bounds. Here, we study sterile neutrino in the context of a mass-varying scenario by coupling both active and sterile neutrino to a scalar field. This novel mechanism opens up a new parameter space that generates the observed DM relic and alleviates the \\textit{Hubble tension}. We find that the resulting parameter space can be fully probed by future X-ray missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores a keV-scale sterile neutrino as dark matter, coupled to a scalar field to vary its mass, potentially resolving the Hubble tension and expanding viable parameter space, which future X-ray missions could test.", "motivation": "The Dodelson-Widrow mechanism, a standard sterile neutrino production method, faces stringent astrophysical constraints.
