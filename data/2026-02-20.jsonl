Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation."}

Because the Pt/Cr-Ne lamps used for the wavecals have been fading (especially at the shortest wavelengths), some changes in the default lamp and/or exposure time have been implemented in recent years to maintain accurate calibrations. To assess whether additional changes might be appropriate, we examine the distribution of the SHIFTA1, SHIFTA2 values derived from the wavecals (the x and y offsets of the spectral image on the detector), we re-visit the wavelength-dependent fading of the lamps, and we perform simulations to estimate the exposure times that would be needed to obtain accurate SHIFTA values. While the current wavecals do appear to yield reasonable SHIFTA, increases in the default exposure times for some of the shortest-wavelength settings would help to ensure reliable wavelength zero points as the lamps continue to fade."}

The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing.

Most models for QPEs invoke repeated interactions of a stellar-mass orbiting companion around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In these scenarios, a positive $\\dot{P}$ is surprising, but not impossible to produce. We explore several possible explanations for the observed $\\dot{P}$, including stable mass-transfer driven by impulsive mass loss events in an EMRI, velocity kicks at pericenter due to tidal interactions with the SMBH, apparent period changes due either to general relativistic precession effects in an EMRI or light travel-time delays in a hierarchical SMBH binary, and mass-transfer variations in a thermal/viscous disk instability model. We find that none of the considered models provides a complete explanation for the data, motivating further work on physical explanations for positive period derivatives in QPEs."}

In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity."}

The uniquely low-energy nuclear isomeric transition in ${}^{229}$Th provides such sensitivity: it directly probes the nuclear interaction and, owing to a near cancellation between electromagnetic and nuclear contributions, its response to changes in nuclear structure is greatly amplified.

We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN."}

In such models, the DM annihilation cross section is typically suppressed by the small kinetic mixing and or a heavy mediator, often leading to an overabundant relic density. We show that the observed DM abundance can be achieved if the dark Higgs undergoes a strong first order phase transition after DM freeze-out. In this scenario, the relic abundance is set by thermal freeze-out in the symmetric phase and subsequently reduced by entropy injection from the phase transition, rather than by annihilation in the broken phase. We find that to reproduce the observed relic abundance, the required phase transition is generically supercooled. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal lies within the sensitivity of future experiments, providing a complementary probe of this framework. Moreover, a strongly supercooled phase transition can potentially account for the NANOGrav signal for DM masses below $O(10)$ GeV."}

The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size.

The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia. Based on the initial high-cadence ugr-band data from the WFST-PS survey, we emphasize that early near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations are indispensable for placing tight constraints on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems of SNe Ia."}

A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws."}

Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \\pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $Δm_{15}(B) = 1.53 \\pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $Δm_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia.

A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity."}

The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity). We further elaborate about the stability properties of SBSs which have been the subject of some controversy recently."}

This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation."}

While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors."}

Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $α_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $λ_{Edd}$, with a break at $λ_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum."}

This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies."}

The near degeneracy originates from treating the symmetric contribution to the Majorana mass matrix, arising from the $\\mathbf{3}\\otimes\\mathbf{3}$ decomposition of $A_4$, as a small perturbation to the dominant singlet contribution. Generalized CP (gCP) symmetry is imposed in the model, rendering the complex modulus $τ$ as the sole source of CP violation.

The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time.

This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios.

We show that magnetic dipole-dipole interactions within the lattice can be dynamically suppressed through a high-frequency magnetic field, rendering the system effectively noninteracting, at the cost of only a moderate reduction in signal amplitude due to the distinct renormalization of linear and quadratic spin responses.

While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors."}

By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot.

For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (ρ_c > 10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs.

In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity.

This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable."}

By varying the interaction strength of three sets of models for the quark-antiquark interaction, the transition from the chiral symmetric to the chirally broken regime in the vacuum is studied. The simplest type of these models leads to degenerate meson spectra for a large domain of the strength parameter. The more sophisticated and thus more realistic models show significantly smaller parameter domains for which degenerate meson spectra are obtained. The underlying mechanism for obtaining and then lifting degeneracies is traced back to the location of the quark propagators' poles, in particular, whether they are beyond or within the domain of integration in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. In view of this mechanism the potential relation of the obtained degeneracies to the dynamical emergence of symmetries is discussed, adding thereby another point of view on the conjectured chiral spin symmetry of QCD in the temperature domain right above the crossover."}

Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--García black hole as the seed."}

Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation."}

The full RMM encodes detailed pairwise correlations among jets, b-jets, leptons, photons, and missing transverse energy but contains more than a thousand values per event, making it computationally heavy for large-scale training and incompatible with current low-qubit quantum devices. The proposed RMM-C46 input space for ML preserves the physical block structure of the RMM through aggregated invariant mass, rapidity difference, and transverse energy components, reducing the size of the original RMM by over an order of magnitude while maintaining interpretability. Applied to simulated proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, these representations match or exceed the discriminative performance of the full RMM in both supervised and unsupervised ML tasks. Their compactness, stability, and physics transparency also make them naturally compatible with near-term quantum machine learning architectures.

Due to their speed dispersion, they would arrive at Earth as an extended packet with a time spread that can be as large as tens of millennia for typical detectors. It has been argued in the literature that the superposition of packets from all galactic SNe would give rise to a smooth and stationary diffuse flux that could be observable on terrestrial experiments. In this article, we critically examine this hypothesis by carrying out a numerical simulation of the galactic history of SN explosions. We show that, although the particle packets do overlap, due to the short observational time window, each of them only contributes with a very narrow range of energies and with an intensity that depends on the SN distance. As a consequence, the energy dependence of the resulting flux is extremely sensitive to the stochastic nature of the SN population and far from smooth. This has profound implications for the expected signature in terrestrial experiments, which displays a spectral shape that is not properly described by the smooth approximation. We develop a numerical tool to compute this stochastic galactic flux for generic semi-relativistic particles, which also allows us to explore sub-MeV particles, where the smooth diffuse flux approach does not hold. To test this framework, we revisit existing bounds on axion-like particles and fermionic dark matter, finding weaker constraints than previously reported."}
