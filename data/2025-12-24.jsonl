For each of the six pulsars that were monitored on a regular basis by NICER, their rotation phase-connected timing model covers the entire period of NICER observations, in many cases from 2017-2025. For PSR J0058-7218, which was only identified in 2021, we extend the baseline of its timing model by 3 years and report detections of its first three glitches. The timing model for PSR J0537-6910 over the entire 8 years of NICER monitoring is presented, including a total of 23 glitches; we also report its spin frequency and pulsed spectrum from a 2016 NuSTAR observation. For PSR B0540-69, its complete timing model from 2015-2025 is provided, including a braking index evolution from near 0 to 1.6 during this period. The 8-year timing model for PSR J1412+7922 (also known as Calvera) is reported, which includes a position that is consistent with that measured from imaging. For PSR J1811-1925, we present its 3.5-year timing model. For PSR J1813-1749, its incoherent timing model is extended through early 2025 using new Chandra observations. For PSR J1849-0001, its 7-year timing model is provided, including a position that is consistent with and more accurate than its imaging position and its first glitch that is one of the largest ever measured. Our timing models of these seven X-ray pulsars enable their study at other energies and in gravitational wave data."}

Using the row-normalized response matrix and the published unfolded spectrum as a truth prior, we construct an absolute-level migration matrix and generate the event-by-event truth and reconstructed-level pairs by drawing from a two-dimensional probability distribution function. The resulting sample statistically replicates the detector response properties of the Pierre Auger Surface Detector. This pseudo-MC sample allows for the application of classical unfolding techniques (bin-by-bin and iterative Bayesian unfolding via RooUnfold) as well as a machine-learning-based unfolding using OmniFold. We demonstrate that using such publicly available information this approach allows the full unfolding procedure."}

Recent observations have shown a dramatic change in the emission properties of this class of sources observed at low luminosity. We explore the timing and spectral properties of the XRP MAXI J0655-013 observed in the low-luminosity regime (about 5x$10^{33}$ erg/s) to witness the corresponding spectral shape and pulse profiles. We employ recent $XMM$ and $NuSTAR$ pointed observations of the MAXI J0655-013 X-ray activity during the low-luminosity stage. We explore several spectral models to fit the data and test theoretical expectations of the dramatic transition of the spectral shape. We study the pulsating nature of the source and find a phase-connected timing solution. We explore the energy-resolved pulse profiles and the derived energy-dependence of different pulsed fraction estimators ($PF_{minmax}$ and $PF_{rms}$). We also obtain $NuSTAR$ pulsed fraction spectra (PFS) at different luminosity regimes. MAXI J0655-013 spectrum is well fitted by a double Comptonization model, in agreement with recent observational results and theoretical expectations that explain the observed spectrum as being composed of two distinct bumps, each dominated by different polarization modes. We measure a spin period of $1081.86\\pm0.02$ s, consistent with the source spinning-up compared to previous observations, yielding an upper limit for the magnetic field strength of B<9x$10^{13}$ G. The pulse profiles show a single broad peak interrupted by a sharp dip that coincides with an increase in the hardness ratio. For the low-luminosity observation, the $PF_{minmax}$ increases with energy up to $\\sim100\\%$ in the 10-30 keV band, while the $PF_{rms}$ remains steady at $\\sim60\\%$. The PFS obtained at high luminosity shows evidence of an iron $Kα$ emission line but no indications of a cyclotron line."}

Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfvénic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfvénic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds."}

It is often said that both types of mass cannot be distinguished in neutrino oscillation phenomena. This is in fact not true if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac (strictly speaking still Majorana) where they mix almost maximally with sterile neutrinos to form pseudo-Dirac pairs. If this is indeed realized in Nature, what we observe experimentally as three mass eigenstates are actually three pairs of mass eigenstates with yet-to-be-measured new mass splitting among each pair. While the new mass squared splitting of the first and second mass eigenstates have stringent constraints from solar neutrino to be $|δm_{1,2}^2| \\lesssim10^{-11}\\,\\textrm{eV}^{2}$, the one regarding the third mass eigenstate has a weaker constraint $|δm_3^2| \\lesssim10^{-5}\\,\\textrm{eV}^{2}$.

To identify lensed SNe in large imaging datasets, current surveys primarily rely on the {\\it magnification} effect of gravitational lensing -- searching for transients that appear brighter than expected \\cite{c3}. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept study that uses a deep neural network to classify previously detected transients. Instead of relying on magnification, this network aims to identify doubly-imaged SNe with small separations ($<0.6$ arcsec) based on the {\\it distorted shape} of the transient object. This proposed method is most applicable to space-based imaging surveys from wide-field imaging observatories such as the upcoming Roman Space Telescope. To train and test our network, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging surveys. Due to the extreme rarity of lensed SNe, we cannot train a neural network on actual lensed SN data. Instead, we have used HST imaging data to generate simulated imaging datasets for both training and testing. Our simulations use astrophysical priors to define the separations, relative brightnesses, and colors of each multiply-imaged SN. We have also simulated false positives (image artifacts and unlensed supernovae), which are much more prevalent than true lensed SN. Our deep learning model is trained to identify lensed SNe from a single difference image (i.e., not using multiple epochs). This network achieves a recall score of 99\\% on simulated gravitationally lensed SNe. The network successfully distinguishes between single supernovae (SNe) and those with gravitationally lensed SNe, as well as images with zero SNe, achieving recall scores of 90\\% and 96\\% for single-SNe and zero-SNe images, respectively."}

Neutron stars are the only known systems in the Universe that reach densities several times higher than normal nuclear density at nearly zero temperature, making them unique laboratories for studying dense matter. Since most neutron-star observables are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS), observational data place stringent constraints on the EOS of strongly interacting matter. In this work, we investigate constraints arising from the mass of the heaviest observed neutron star (a black widow pulsar), perturbative QCD calculations at asymptotically high densities, NICER mass-radius measurements, and the tidal deformability inferred from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We parametrize the EOS and allow its parameters to vary freely, using observational data to constrain the admissible parameter space. We find that neutron-star observations significantly restrict the EOS of dense strongly interacting matter. While NICER has already provided measurements for five pulsars, the associated uncertainties remain relatively large. In contrast, the existence of very massive neutron stars and constraints on the tidal deformability emerge as particularly powerful probes of the EOS."}

Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis.

We focus on Quasi-topological theories involving infinite towers of terms for which the unique vacuum spherically symmetric solutions correspond to regular black holes. We solve analytically the problem of constant-density stars and find that the space of solutions is bounded by: configurations with divergent central-pressure, corresponding to the most compact stars; configurations which possess zero central-pressure; and configurations for which the sizes of the stars coincide with the inner-horizon radii of the would-be regular black holes. In the more general case of perfect-fluid stars for which the mean density decreases with increasing radius, we show that, for each density profile, maximum compactness is reached when the metric becomes singular at the center. Under certain additional conditions, we find a novel Buchdahl limit for the maximum compactness of stars, attained by a specific constant-density profile. We show, in particular, that stars in these theories may be more compact than in Einstein gravity. While the vacuum solutions of these theories are such that all curvature invariants take mass-independent maximum finite values, we argue that there exist ordinary matter stars with finite central pressures for which such bounds can be violated -- namely, arbitrarily high curvatures can be reached -- unless additional constraints, such as the dominant energy condition, are imposed on the fluid."}

We model various stochastic noise sources present in the dataset using stationary Gaussian processes and estimate the noise budget of the InPTA-DR2 using Bayesian inference, involving model selection, Fourier harmonics selection, and parameter estimation for each pulsar. We check the efficacy of our noise characterisation by performing the Anderson-Darling test for Gaussianity on the noise-subtracted residuals. We find that all 11 pulsars with time baseline $\\lesssim2.5\\,\\text{yr}$ show Gaussian residuals and do not have evidence for any red noise process in the optimal model, except for PSR J1944$+$0907, which shows presence of DM noise. PSRs J0437$-$4715, J1909$-$3744 and J1939$+$2134 show preference for the most complicated noise model, having achromatic and chromatic red noise processes. Only 4 out of 15 pulsars with time baseline $\\gtrsim2.5\\,\\text{yr}$ show significant non-Gaussianity in noise-subtracted residuals. We suspect that this may require more advanced methods to model noise processes properly. A comparative study of six pulsars with data removed near solar conjunctions showed deviations from the parameter estimates obtained with the original dataset, indicating potential bias in red noise processes due to unmodeled solar-wind effects. The results presented in this work remain broadly consistent with the InPTA-DR1 noise budget, with better constraints obtained on noise processes for several pulsars and support for achromatic red noise in PSR J1012$+$5307 due to the extended time baseline."}

We therefore construct a one-to-one correspondence principle between broken residual symmetries and vacuum alignment corrections, providing a mechanism to identify (and correct) a subtle but persistent form of phenomenologically relevant fine-tuning embedded in -- but often ignored by -- most successful non-Abelian flavour models. We first establish this correspondence in a set of toy models based on the S4 permutation symmetry, and then apply the lessons learned to the more realistic A4 Altarelli-Feruglio and $Δ(27)$ Universal Texture Zero models."}

Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the mass and thermodynamic properties of static asymptotically flat quantum black holes both analytically and numerically. First, we analytically investigate eternal quantum black hole solutions to a one-parameter family of analytically solvable models interpolating between Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius and Bose, Parker, and Peleg gravities. Examining these models in a semi-classically allowed parameter space, we find naked singularities may exist for quantum fields in the Boulware state. Using a quasi-local formalism, where we confine the black hole to a finite sized cavity, we derive the conserved energy and analyze the system's thermal behavior. Specifically, we show the semi-classical Wald entropy precisely equals the generalized entropy, accounting for both gravitational and fine grained matter entropies, and we find a range where the quantum black holes are thermally stable. Finally, we numerically construct eternal black hole solutions to semi-classical Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger gravity and find their thermal behavior is qualitatively different from their analytic counterparts. In the process, we develop an analytic expansion of the solutions and find it accurately approximates the full numerical solutions in the semi-classical limit."}

In this work, we assess the scientific reach of PUEO. In particular, we evaluate the sensitivity of this observatory to cosmogenic neutrinos and, in turn, to the proton fraction of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. We also consider the potential of PUEO to probe scenarios in which neutrinos are produced through the decays of ultraheavy dark matter particles or are radiated from cosmic strings. We find that PUEO will be able to constrain the proton composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays in scenarios that feature very strong source evolution and in which protons are accelerated to extremely high energies. Although gamma-ray observations are generally more sensitive to decaying particles than neutrino observations, PUEO is expected to set the strongest neutrino-detector constraints above 10^19 eV. PUEO will also provide the strongest constraints on some models of cosmic strings."}

Recent geometric approaches based on conic hulls and triangulations provide a systematic framework for computing multiple MB integrals in terms of multivariate series. These approaches have so far been limited to MB integrals whose integrands are ratios of products of Euler's gamma functions only. However, in Feynman integral calculus, MB integrals with polygamma functions naturally arise, for instance, after resolving singularities in the dimensional-regularisation parameter $ε$ and expanding the MB integrand in powers of $ε$, as done by the public codes MB.m and MBresolve.m. In this paper, we extend the conic hull and triangulation methods to the computation of MB integrals having polygamma functions in their integrand. We show that the arguments of polygamma functions can be treated in a similar way to the arguments of gamma functions when applying the conic hull and triangulation techniques to identify poles that would contribute to different series solutions. However, since the singularity structure of the polygamma function is different from that of the gamma function, we propose two different ways to compute MB integrals involving polygamma functions, depending on whether the MB integral has straight or non-straight contours. We have implemented these algorithms in an updated version of the Mathematica package MBConicHulls.wl, which can be found at https://github.com/SumitBanikGit/MBConicHulls/, and we illustrate their use with a set of examples from Feynman integral calculus."}

Unlike conventional analyses, we do not use the decays of the neutrino embedded in the right-chiral lepton doublet, but rather those of the gauge-singlet mediators required for neutrino mass generation in the canonical Type-I seesaw. Due to the generalized parity symmetry that doubles the fermionic degrees of freedom in this model, we can generate the required $CP$ violation in the heavy fermion decays with only a single generation of mediators. One of the distinct features of our scenario is that the bounds from thermalization or washout via gauge interactions typically encountered in the canonical left-right symmetric models do not apply here. Moreover, the heavy mediators can decay to both the left and the right-chiral neutrinos, leading to a cancellation in the resulting baryon asymmetry for decays above the left-right symmetry breaking scale. We discuss ways to avoid this cancellation and show that low scale left-right symmetry breaking above the current collider limits is viable. The right chiral neutrinos also obtain their masses from the seesaw mechanism, and the lightest one turns out to have a sub-eV scale mass. We find that its abundance is consistent with standard cosmology, and it acts as potentially observable dark radiation."}

We prove that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime is Petrov type I, not fitting the Class B warped product spacetime definition. Second, we assess the relative magnitude of the Weyl scalar curvature invariant and compare it with the amplitudes of Einstein's scalar and the Ricci quadratic and cubic invariants within the warp-bubble zone. Previous studies have focused on Ricci curvature and the energy-momentum tensor, neglecting the Weyl curvature, which we demonstrate plays a significant role due to the sharp localization of the form function near the warp-bubble radius. Third, we visualize several curvature invariants for Nat'{a}rio's warp drive, as well as momentum density, which we show as the critical physical quantity governing the orientation of the warp drive trajectory, overshadowing space volume changes. Fourth, we critically examine claims that Nat'{a}rio's warp drive is more realistic than Alcubierre's. We demonstrate that Nat'{a}rio's spacetime exhibits curvature invariant amplitudes 35 times greater than Alcubierre's, given identical warp-bubble parameters, making Nat'{a}rio's concept even less viable. Additionally, we address Mattingly et al.'s analysis, highlighting their underestimation of curvature invariant amplitudes by 21 orders of magnitude."}

Another consequence is the suppression of energetic particles in the jet which has been observed already for c- and b-quark jets. The suppression of the forward particles can be explained by an application of the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) of perturbative QCD. In this paper we investigate whether this type of analysis can be carried out also for top-quark jets with the much higher heavy quark mass allowing for QCD tests in this new kinematic regime. The new aspect of this analysis is the finite lifetime of the top quark. We consider for simplicity the decay $t\\to b\\ellν$, where the b-quark radiates gluons as well and partially obscures the dead cone. Guided by the decay amplitude in leading order in $α_s$ we propose a method to separate the radiation by the $\\widehat{tb}$ dipole in the decay process which is superimposed to the primary radiation from the $\\widehat{t \\bar t}$ dipole involving the top-quark dead cone effect. The momentum distributions of partons or charged particles are determined for finite decay angles of the b-quark $Θ_b$ and extrapolated into forward direction $Θ_b=0$ where the radiation from the decay process is expected to vanish. This method is successfully tested at the parton level and results obtained for hadrons are compatible with the MLLA relation within an accuracy of around 15\\%.

The inference further suggests that both black holes possess high spins, measured to be $0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$. Therefore, the observation of this event suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond the standard stellar collapse. However, different waveform models yield significantly different parameter estimates, possibly due to missing physics in the models used in inference. In this work, we carry out a reanalysis of GW231123 using a physically complete model, accounting for both spin precession and eccentricity. Our analysis shows that this event does not exhibit strong evidence for eccentricity and the exclusion of eccentricity has minimal impact on inference. Furthermore, for GW231123-like systems, even eccentricities as large as $0.15$ at $10$ Hz do not yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement. Through a zero-noise injection recovery study, we show that the observed discrepancies in the parameter estimates can be explained by disagreement in the waveform models at strong spin precession, with the degree of parameter bias in the zero-noise runs being comparable to that observed for the real signal. We also show that inference performed with an eccentric, aligned-spin waveform model can yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement due to the degeneracy between eccentricity and spin precession. Bayesian model selection, however, rules out this interpretation in favor of the eccentric, spin precessing hypothesis, which supports zero eccentricity -- a conclusion we confirm with additional zero-noise injection-recovery tests."}

An Examination on the Effect of Higher Diligence Calculations of the Sound Shell Model", "comment": "34 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "The gravitational wave spectrum arising from using the full velocity profile is well known to differ qualitatively from analytic fits to a broken power law. Former studies have shown that unlike the uncertainties arising from thermal field theory, more diligence in the hydrodynamics can sometimes have limited benefit. However, this was shown in the context of broken power law fits. We test the benefits of some recent calculations in modeling the spectrum, including new developments in adjustments of the low frequency tail to be consistent with causality, but we use the full velocity profile. We find the spectral shape information has a heightened sensitivity to the speed of sound which can be demonstrated analytically, however for our benchmark model this still results in a modest difference. The reason for a heightened sensitivity is because the velocity at the boundary is quite sensitive to the speed of sound, which in turn means a small change to the speed of sound can have a large change to the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, even modest changes in the product $ακ$ can make non-trivial changes to the shape around the peak. Finally, there are many points where adjusting the infrared behavior to be consistent with causality is affecting the spectrum near its peak. All this implies that the spectrum is sensitive to five thermal parameters rather than four which gives hope that an observation of a gravitational wave spectrum from a first order cosmological phase transition could eventually give even more information about the underlying microphysics responsible."}

In the $μ_0$ scheme in which the quantum parameters are treated as constants, the equations of motion generated by the effective Hamiltonian are solved analytically. The resulting quantum-corrected effective spacetime obviously extends the effective spacetime previously obtained in the literature. In the new effective spacetime, the naked singularity and the central singularity presented in the classical JNW spacetime are resolved by a series of quantum bounces. In the scheme of choosing the quantum parameters as Dirac observables, the effective dynamics is also solved in the light of the solution in $μ_0$ scheme. It turns out that the resulting effective spacetime has singularities due to the appearance of the zero points of the time reparametrization functions. Hence, the effective theory in this scheme does not remain valid throughout the full spacetime."}

Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies.

The usual EoS for the static and SS case, $ρ= -p_r$, is no longer satisfied due to the presence of the HG AE terms. We study three linear EoS associated with: an analogue charged BH, a non-trivial extremal BH, and an ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, respectively. The HG AE terms lead to exotic behaviors, both in the physical properties of the solutions and in their thermodynamics. In Case I, the matter sources can be interpreted as an exotic anisotropic matter distribution, giving rise to an effective electric-potential term in the geometry. In Case II, we obtain a non trivial extremal BH solution for which the event horizon is $n_{\\text{odd}}$ fold degenerate.

Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis.

It consists of 64 pages and 11 figures", "summary": "In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, the universe existed in an extremely hot, dense state in which particle interactions occurred not in a vacuum but within a thermal medium. Under such conditions, the standard framework of quantum field theory (QFT) requires a finite temperature extension, wherein propagators -- and hence the fundamental structure of the theory -- are modified to reflect thermal background effects. These thermal modifications are central to understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) as a high temperature phase transition, potentially leading to qualitatively different vacuum structures for the Higgs field as the universe cooled. Finite temperature corrections naturally regulate ultraviolet divergences in propagators, hinting at a possible route toward ultraviolet completion. However, these same thermal effects exacerbate infrared pathologies and can lead to imaginary contributions to the effective potential, particularly when analysing metastable or multi-vacuum configurations. Additional theoretical challenges, such as gauge dependence and renormalization scale ambiguity, further obscure the precise characterization of the electroweak phase transition even in minimal extensions of the Standard Model (SM). This review presents the theoretical foundations of finite temperature QFT with an emphasis on how different field species respond to thermal effects, identifying the bosonic sector as the primary source of key theoretical subtleties. We focus particularly on the scalar extension of the SM, which offers a compelling framework for realizing first order electroweak phase transitions, electroweak baryogenesis, and accommodating dark matter candidates depending on the underlying $Z_2$ symmetry structure."}

We compute the associated curvature scalars and provide initial data on characteristics for the isolated horizon. In addition to an analytical solution, derived by leveraging extensive results on Kerr null geodesics, we develop two complementary series expansions and outline a practical numerical recipe to make the construction readily usable.

Further, we quantify the systematic errors by developing a Bayesian inference framework for the current detector network. The inspiral-only aligned spin gravitational wave waveform model for eccentric binaries, TaylorF2Ecc, is employed. For the current detector network, neglecting an initial eccentricity of $e_0^{\\rm inj}=0.1$ defined at $20\\,\\mathrm {Hz} $ can lead to a serious bias in binary parameter inference.

Both models face challenges, including explaining the nature of dark matter, the origin of the Universe's initial conditions, and the fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass. This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ''accidents'', which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles. Focusing on 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles from SO(3)$\\rightarrow$SO(2) symmetry breaking, we explore both second-order and first-order phase transitions, and we identify the regions of parameter space where the monopole relic density matches the one of dark matter. This model also features stable massive gauge bosons. We find that the relic density of dark gauge bosons is always far larger than the one of monopoles, concluding that dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter."}

Neutron stars are the only known systems in the Universe that reach densities several times higher than normal nuclear density at nearly zero temperature, making them unique laboratories for studying dense matter. Since most neutron-star observables are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS), observational data place stringent constraints on the EOS of strongly interacting matter. In this work, we investigate constraints arising from the mass of the heaviest observed neutron star (a black widow pulsar), perturbative QCD calculations at asymptotically high densities, NICER mass-radius measurements, and the tidal deformability inferred from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We parametrize the EOS and allow its parameters to vary freely, using observational data to constrain the admissible parameter space. We find that neutron-star observations significantly restrict the EOS of dense strongly interacting matter. While NICER has already provided measurements for five pulsars, the associated uncertainties remain relatively large. In contrast, the existence of very massive neutron stars and constraints on the tidal deformability emerge as particularly powerful probes of the EOS."}

Here $H$, $\\dot{H}$, and $β$ are the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of $H$, and a non-negative dimensionless coefficient, respectively. The dissipative term is proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature, suggesting that the dynamic creation pressure has the same dependence. We examine the model's background evolution in the late universe and its horizon thermodynamics. The present model supports a transition from a decelerating universe to an accelerating universe when $β<0.5$. The second law of thermodynamics is always satisfied on the horizon, and maximization of entropy is satisfied in the final stage. We examine constraints on the present model using observed Hubble parameter data and the transitional and thermodynamic constraints and find that a weakly dissipative universe with $Λ$ is likely favored and consistent with our Universe. We also discuss irreversible entropy due to adiabatic particle creation, assuming a holographic-like matter creation cosmology."}
