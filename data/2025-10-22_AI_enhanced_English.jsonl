From observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxy\nrotation curves, as well as strong cluster lensing, we place constraints on the\nmicrophysics parameters. From these constrained regions, we map the\nmicrophysics to effective \\texttt{ETHOS} parameters and evolve the linear power\nspectrum in \\texttt{CLASS}.

We categorize flares into prompt flares\n(occurring during the prompt emission phase) and afterglow flares and compare\ntheir temporal and luminosity properties. Our analysis reveals that both types\nof flares exhibit similar morphological characteristics, with prompt flares\nbeing brighter and occurring earlier than afterglow flares. We find strong\ncorrelations between flare parameters, such as peak time, duration, and\nluminosity, which follow consistent patterns across both flare types.

Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner\nresonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the\ntemperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned\nnear resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the\nrequired CMB era suppression without fine tuning.
