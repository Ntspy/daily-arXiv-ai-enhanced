Abstract: The Ice Giants Study was commissioned by NASA to take a fresh look (as of 2017) at science priorities and concepts for missions to the Uranus and Neptune systems in preparation for the third Planetary Science Decadal Survey. This study was led by a Science Definition Team (SDT) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with participation from Langley Research Center, Ames Research Center, The Aerospace Corporation, Purdue University, and the European Space Agency. The SDT was appointed by NASA and co-chaired by Mark Hofstadter (JPL) and Amy Simon (Goddard Space Flight Center). The Study Manager was Kim Reh (JPL) and the Study Lead was John Elliott (JPL). The study team assessed and prioritized science objectives taking into account advances since the last Decadal Survey, current and emerging technologies, mission implementation techniques and celestial mechanics. This study examined a wide range of mission architectures, flight elements, and instruments. Six of the prioritized concepts were studied via JPL's Team X process and resulting cost estimates were subjected to independent assessment by The Aerospace Corporation. Results presented herein show that high-value flagship-class mission concepts to either Uranus or Neptune are achievable within ground rule budgetary constraints.

### [2] [The CHASM-SWPC Dataset for Coronal Hole Detection & Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14044)
*Cutter Beck,Evan Smith,Khagendra Katuwal,Rudra Kafle,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents CHASM, a semi-automated tool for annotating coronal hole maps, and the CHASM-SWPC dataset, which improves the performance of automated detection models like CHRONNOS, achieving higher accuracy and IoU compared to previous work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reliable dataset for training automated CH detection models and improve annotation efficiency through semi-automatic methods.

Method: Developed CHASM for semi-automatic annotation of SWPC maps into binary masks, creating the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. Trained CHRONNOS neural networks on this dataset and compared performance metrics.

Result: The trained CHRONNOS model achieved higher accuracy (0.9805 vs 0.9708), TSS (0.6807 vs 0.6749), and IoU (0.5668 vs 0.4805) than the original CHRONNOS model.

Conclusion: The CHASM tool and dataset significantly enhance coronal hole detection accuracy and provide a robust benchmark for future machine learning models in solar physics.

Abstract: Coronal holes (CHs) are low-activity, low-density solar coronal regions with open magnetic field lines (Cranmer 2009). In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al. (2021) achieved an accuracy of 0.9708, a TSS of 0.6749, and an IoU of 0.4805, when evaluated on the CHASM-SWPC-1111 test set.

*Hien Phan-Thanh,Nguyen Nguyen-Duc,Thuy Le-Quang,Tobias C. Hinse,Quang Nguyen-Luong*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: SPECTRUMMATE is a compact, cost-effective spectrometer designed for small telescopes, offering high-resolution visible spectrum analysis with modular components, ideal for amateur astronomers and educational use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide affordable, accessible spectroscopic tools for small telescopes users, enabling contributions to astronomy through bright object observations.

Method: Adaptation of the Sol'EX design using available optical components (collimator, diffraction grating, objective lens) with focus on compactness and ease of alignment. Experimental setups were optimized for minimal spectral dispersion.

Result: Achieved spectral coverage 4000-6600 angstrom, 368 angstrom/pixel resolution, R=2546 at 5500 angstrom. Successful calibration and high-resolution spectra capture of solar spectra.

Conclusion: SPECTRUMMATE effectively meets needs for accessible spectroscopy, proving valuable for amateur/educational use with modular design allowing customization for different spectral requirements.

Abstract: This project presents the development and implementation of a compact spectrometer, named SPECTRUMMATE, tailored for small telescopes. Small telescopes offer several advantages: they are cost-effective, occupy less space, and are simpler to set up than larger instruments. This makes them particularly suitable for amateur astronomers and educational institutions with limited resources. Moreover, small telescopes can effectively observe bright celestial objects, enabling valuable contributions to astronomical projects. Based on the Sol'EX design, SPECTRUMMATE was constructed using optical components available at the Space and Applications Laboratory (SpaceLAB), University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam. The instrument is designed to meet the specific needs of astronomers who require detailed analysis within the visible spectrum (SPECTRUMMATE can capture a waveband of 368 angstrom/image, spectral coverage from 4000 to 6600 angstrom, and resolving power R = 2546 at 5500 angstrom). To achieve optimal performance, the design process involved selecting and configuring optical elements, including a collimator, diffraction grating, and objective lens. Experimental setups were tested to minimize spectral dispersion while ensuring the system's compactness and ease of alignment. Spectra obtained by SPECTRUMMATE demonstrated efficient spectral calibration and the capability to capture high-resolution spectra of bright light sources, such as the Sun, making it a valuable tool for specialised spectroscopic observations. The modular design of SPECTRUMMATE also allows users to change its components easily to achieve the desired spectral range and resolution.

### [4] [Detection of Faint Sources by the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope Onboard AstroSat Using Poisson Distribution of Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14254)
*B. Ananthamoorthy,Debbijoy Bhattacharya,P. Sreekumar,Swathi B*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced method for creating UV source catalogs using UVIT/AstroSat data by incorporating Poisson distribution modeling of the UV background, leading to improved detection of faint sources with 15-92% more new entries, especially in less crowded fields like the SMC and M31.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior UV source cataloging methods struggled with detecting faint sources due to incomplete modeling of the background noise. This paper addresses the need for a more accurate statistical framework to enhance source detection sensitivity in UVIT observations.

Method: The approach models the UV background as a Poisson distribution, allowing better estimation of noise fluctuations. It was tested on non-crowded fields (SMC, M31, Field 13), comparing results against previous UVIT studies to validate its effectiveness in detecting fainter objects.

Result: The new method detected significantly more sources compared to existing techniques, with increases ranging from ~15% to 92%. Newly identified sources predominantly populate the faint-end magnitude regime (m ≥ 22). Most detected UV sources have counterparts in other wavelengths.

Conclusion: This improved UV source detection method offers superior efficiency in identifying faint UV sources, opening avenues for discovering new UV-emitting object classes and advancing multiwavelength studies through better source catalog accuracy.

Abstract: We present an improved approach for constructing the UV source catalogs using observations from the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, by considering the Poisson distribution of the UV background. The method is tested extensively using fields that are not crowded, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and M31 (Field 13). The results are compared with previous studies that used UVIT observations. This approach is successful in detecting fainter sources and produces a large number of new sources ($\sim 15$ to $92\%$ more). Most of the newly discovered UV sources fall in the faint end of the source distribution (m $\gtrsim 22$). The counterparts at other wavelengths are identified for most sources. This approach is more efficient for source detection and provides an opportunity to explore new classes of UV sources.

### [5] [Estimating differential pistons for the Extremely Large Telescope using focal plane imaging and a residual network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14577)
*P. Janin-Potiron,M. Gray,B. Neichel,M. Dumont,J. -F. Sauvage,C. T. Heritier,P. Jouve,R. Fetick,T. Fusco*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to estimate differential piston in ELT's M4 mirror using a ResNet-based neural network trained on Shack-Hartmann data, demonstrating robustness across varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing ELT's imaging performance by addressing differential piston degradation caused by AO systems or thermal/mechanical effects.

Method: Developed a ResNet neural network trained on simulated 2x2 SH-WFS data to estimate differential piston, analyzing sensitivity to Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, noise, and requiring temporal averaging of speckle frames.

Result: The method achieved differential piston estimation with RMSE improvement via temporal averaging; polychromaticity <5% impact; detector noise not a primary limitation compared to speckle averaging requirements.

Conclusion: The approach effectively extracts differential piston info from SH-WFS images, applicable beyond 2x2 sensors, and highlights turbulence speckle averaging's importance for accuracy.

Abstract: As the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) approaches operational status, optimising its imaging performance is critical. A differential piston, arising from either the adaptive optics (AO) control loop, thermomechanical effects, or other sources, significantly degrades the image quality and is detrimental to the telescope's overall performance. In a numerical simulation set-up, we propose a method for estimating the differential piston between the petals of the ELT's M4 mirror using images from a 2x2 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS), commonly used in the ELT's tomographic AO mode. We aim to identify the limitations of this approach by evaluating its sensitivity to various observing conditions and sources of noise. Using a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture, we trained a neural network (NN) on simulated datasets to estimate the differential piston. We assessed the robustness of the method under various conditions, including variations in Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, and detector noise. The performance was quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated differential piston aberration. This method demonstrates the ability to extract differential piston information from 2x2 SH-WFS images. Temporal averaging of frames makes the differential piston signal emerge from the turbulence-induced speckle field and leads to a significant improvement in the RMSE calculation. As expected, better seeing conditions result in improved accuracy. Polychromaticity only degrades the performance by less than 5% compared to the monochromatic case. In a realistic scenario, detector noise is not a limiting factor, as the primary limitation rather arises from the need for sufficient speckle averaging. The network was also shown to be applicable to input images other than the 2x2 SH-WFS data.

Abstract: Recognizing and addressing under-representation, exclusion, and problematic behavior within astronomy and astrophysics is crucial. In 2019, a survey was conducted at the Spirit of Lyot conference to evaluate the socio-demographics and well-being of the exoplanet and disk imaging community. This paper presents the results of a second survey, conducted at the 2022 Spirit of Lyot conference in Leiden, aiming to improve the evaluation of the community, expand diversity-related questions, and monitor the evolution of metrics since 2019. Sent to all participants, the survey received 96 responses. It measures respondents' visibility at conferences, recognition through publications and projects, experiences of disrespect or inappropriate behaviors as victims or witnesses, and identification as allies of minorities. These aspects were analyzed with respect to job position, expatriation, gender, belonging to another under-represented group (ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation), and parenthood.

### [7] [Effects of Lighter-than-QCD Axions on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13812)
*Yonatan Kahn,Michael Wentzel,Nicolás Yunes*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines the effect of lighter-than-QCD axions on neutron star properties using 1+1D general relativity simulations, finding significant impacts on mass, radius, and compactness. These effects could break universal relations and enable axion detection via gravitational waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how finite density corrections to lighter-than-QCD axions alter neutron star properties and their detectability through gravitational wave observations.

Method: First numerical study using 1+1D general relativity to model axion dynamics in neutron stars, extending analysis to low-mass axions with kilometer-scale Compton wavelengths.

Result: Axion field gravitational effects cause order-1 changes in neutron star mass, radius, and compactness, breaking the universal tidal deformability-compactness relation independent of nuclear equation of state assumptions.

Conclusion: Neutron star gravitational wave observations could probe lighter-than-QCD axions, offering a new method for beyond-Standard-Model physics investigations without relying on uncertain nuclear physics inputs.

Abstract: Finite density corrections to the lighter-than-QCD axion can invert the effective axion potential, sourcing a non-trivial axion field inside dense objects. We perform the first numerical study of the complete dynamics of the lighter-than-QCD axion in a neutron star in 1+1 general relativity, extending the region of analysis to low-mass axions with kilometer-scale Compton wavelengths. We calculate gravitational effects of the axion field on the neutron star and show that for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants, neutron star properties, such as the mass, radius, and compactness, are affected at the order-1 level. This result indicates that approximate universal tidal deformability-compactness relation for neutron stars is non-trivially broken and can serve as a probe of lighter-than-QCD axions, independent of the unknown nuclear equation of state. We comment on the potential for axion studies with future gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars and applications of this work to other new physics signatures.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: QCD axions produced in Type Ibc supernovae can convert into detectable gamma rays via magnetic fields, offering a potential discovery opportunity for Fermi-LAT with axion masses down to ~10^-4 eV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The search for QCD axions is optimized by targeting Type Ibc SNe due to their compact, magnetically strong progenitors which enhance axion-photon conversion.

Method: Analyzing gamma-ray signals from Type Ibc SNe using satellites like Fermi-LAT, considering both galactic and progenitor magnetic field contributions in axion to photon conversion mechanisms.

Result: A galactic Type Ibc SN could enable axion mass detection as low as 1e-4 eV (PQ scale ~1e11 GeV), improving upon previous limits from other SN types.

Conclusion: Type Ibc supernovae are the best targets for detecting QCD axions via gamma-ray conversions, providing a critical pathway for axion particle physics exploration.

Abstract: QCD axions would be copiously produced in the proto-neutron star formed in a core-collapse supernova (SN). After escaping, they would convert into gamma rays in the Galactic magnetic field and, as recently shown, in that of the progenitor star itself. Here, we show that Type Ibc SNe -- whose progenitors have lost their hydrogen or even helium envelopes -- are the optimal targets for this search. The stripped progenitors are much more compact, and show larger magnetic fields than both red and blue supergiants, the progenitors of Type IIP/L SNe. If the next galactic SN is of Type Ibc, Fermi-LAT or a similar gamma-ray satellite might be able to discover the QCD axion down to masses as small as $m_a\simeq 10^{-4}\,\rm eV$ (Peccei-Quinn scale $f_a\simeq 10^{11} \,\rm GeV$).

*Z. -N. Xu,Z. -Q. Yao,P. Cheng,C. D. Roberts,J. Rodriguez-Quintero,J. Segovia*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines nucleon structure using both three-body and quark+diquark models to calculate light-front transverse densities, revealing complementary predictions on quark radii and polarized charge distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand nucleon structure by comparing two models and exploring quark Contributions to electromagnetic form factors and transverse densities.

Method: Used nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors from three-body and quark+interacting-diquark models to compute light-front transverse densities, analyzing flavour-separated proton/neutron results and polarization effects.

Result: Both models yield consistent predictions matching modern data; u and d quark Dirac radii are similar, but d quark Pauli radius is 10% larger. Polarized nucleons show charge displacement in transverse plane depending on polarization direction.

Conclusion: The two nucleon structure descriptions effectively complement each other, providing insights into quark dynamics and polarization-induced asymmetries in nucleon charge distributions.

Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $-\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.

### [10] [Production Mechanisms of isoscalar pseudotensor mesons in pion and kaon induced reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14011)
*Dong-En Lu,Li-Ming Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the production of several predicted isoscalar pseudotensor meson states using an effective Lagrangian and Regge trajectory approach, showing selectivity in production mechanisms and identifying optimal beam momenta for experimental detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical gap in the poorly explored spectrum of isoscalar pseudotensor mesons, where predicted radial excitations remain unobserved, following the BESIII Collaboration's observation of X(2600).

Method: Employed an effective Lagrangian approach combined with Regge trajectory phenomenology to model the production of four meson states (η₂(4D), η'_2(2D, 3D, 4D)) and analyze their production cross-sections in pion- and kaon-induced reactions.

Result: Found production selectivity between pion (for η₂(4D)) and kaon (for η'_2(2D, 3D, 4D)) induced reactions, with total cross-section peaks at specific beam momenta for each state.

Conclusion: Provided first comprehensive theoretical predictions for these mesons' production cross-sections, guiding future experimental searches to discover the unobserved radial excitations.

Abstract: The recent observation of the X(2600) resonance by the BESIII Collaboration has motivated a renewed interest in the spectroscopy of light mesons, particularly pseudotensor states. However, a significant theoretical gap exists in the poorly explored spectrum of isoscalar pseudotensor mesons, where several predicted radial excitations remain unobserved. To address this, we investigate the production of four such states ($η_2(4D)$, $η'_2(2D)$, $η'_2(3D)$, and $η'_2(4D)$) employing an effective Lagrangian approach combined with Regge trajectory phenomenology to describe the high-energy behavior of the reactions. Our calculations reveal a distinct production selectivity: the $η_2(4D)$ state is more prominent in pion induced ($π^- p \to η_2 n$) reactions, whereas the $η'_2(2D, 3D, 4D)$ states are preferentially produced in kaon induced ($K^- p \to η_2 Λ$) processes. Moreover, the total cross sections for these states exhibit characteristic peaks at specific beam momenta, providing clear kinematic windows for their discovery. This study provides the first comprehensive theoretical predictions for the production cross sections of these predicted mesons, offering crucial guidance for future experimental searches.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper updates the spectrum of charmonium and bottomonium hybrid mesons using Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory with improved lattice QCD data, analyzes decay transitions, and compares results to experimental data to identify hybrid candidates among XYZ states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interest in hybrid quarkonia and recent discoveries of XYZ mesons motivated the need for an updated spectral analysis incorporating latest lattice QCD data to better identify hybrid candidates.

Method: The study employs Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory framework, integrates recent lattice QCD results on hybrid static potentials, performs error analysis on hybrid-to-conventional quarkonia transitions including spin-conserving and spin-flip decays.

Result: The analysis identifies potential hybrid meson candidates among observed XYZ states, provides interpretations for most isospin-zero heavy mesons, and incorporates new hybrid candidates through comparison with experimental data.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of hybrid quarkonia roles in XYZ mesons, validate the methodology with improved lattice data, and set a foundation for future experiments to confirm hybrid nature of these states.

Abstract: Hybrid quarkonia -exotic hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom- have gained increasing attention in hadron spectroscopy, particularly with the ongoing discovery of new XYZ mesons. In this work, we update the spectrum of heavy hybrid mesons in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors using the Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory framework, by incorporating the latest lattice QCD results for hybrid static potentials. We refine earlier calculations and analyze allowed transitions from hybrids to conventional quarkonia, including both spin-conserved and spin-flip decays. We carry out a comprehensive error analysis and discuss the reliability of our results. We compare them to experimental data of the Particle Data Group, which allows us to identify hybrid candidates among the observed XYZ states. We provide hybrid or quarkonium interpretations for nearly all heavy isospin-zero mesons observed and incorporate new hybrid candidates.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the internal structure of exotic P_c and P_cs pentaquarks using pion emission as a probe within a molecular scenario framework, finding that decay widths depend strongly on their structure and spatial wave functions, advocating for experimental measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the question about the internal structure of P_c and P_cs pentaquarks by identifying a sensitive probe (pion emission) to study their decay properties.

Method: Calculation of pion emission properties using the chiral quark model and coupled-channel effects under a molecular scenario assumption.

Result: Decay widths show strong dependence on the pentaquark's internal structure and spatial wave functions.

Conclusion: Experimental measurements of these decays are urged to clarify the nature of these states and aid in finding molecular partners.

Abstract: The internal structure of the exotic $P_c$ and $P_{cs}$ pentaquarks remains an open question. To address this, we demonstrate that pion emission serves as a sensitive probe by calculating its properties within a molecular scenario using the chiral quark model and coupled-channel effects. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the decay widths on the internal structure and spatial wave functions. We therefore expect this study to stimulate experimental measurements of these decays, which are crucial for determining the nature of these states and guiding the search for further molecular partners.

Abstract: Effective pion-constituent quark couplings induced by relatively weak magnetic fields are calculated, being that they disappear in the vacuum. In particular, couplings to a scalar and a vector constituent quark currents are investigated. These couplings can correspond to a fluctuation of the neutral pion into a scalar quark-antiquark meson and to a vector meson respectively. Some possible phenomenological implications are discussed.

### [14] [Inclusive $J/ψ$ productions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02, 7, and 13 TeV with the PACIAE model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14105)
*Jin-Peng Zhang,Guan-Yu Wang,Wen-Chao Zhang,Bo Feng,An-Ke Lei,Zhi-Lei She,Hua Zheng,Dai-Mei Zhou,Yu-Liang Yan,Ben-Hao Sa*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper uses the PACIAE 4.0 model to analyze J/ψ production in proton-proton collisions at various energies, showing good agreement with experimental data. Key contributions come from NRQCD mechanisms, with hadronic rescattering suppressing yields except in non-prompt J/ψ production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand J/ψ production mechanisms and the role of rescatterings in proton-proton collisions using an extended PYTHIA model, validating against experimental data at multiple energies.

Method: The PACIAE 4.0 model was used, incorporating partonic/hadronic rescatterings. Simulated $J/ψ$ production mechanisms included NRQCD (color-singlet/octet), cluster collapse, and non-prompt sources. Contributions from feed-down channels were decomposed by $p_T$ regions.

Result: Simulated cross sections matched experimental data. NRQCD dominated J/ψ yields. Hadronic rescattering significantly suppressed NRQCD and cluster collapse contributions but not non-prompt J/ψ. Partonic rescattering had negligible effect.

Conclusion: Hadronic interactions post-hadronization play a critical role in suppressing J/ψ yields except in non-prompt production. PACIAE 4.0 effectively models dominant mechanisms across different collision energies.

Abstract: We investigate the inclusive $J/ψ$ productions in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$, 7, and 13 TeV using the PACIAE 4.0 model. This model extends PYTHIA 8.3 by incorporating partonic and hadronic rescatterings before and after hadronization, respectively. Several $J/ψ$ production mechanisms are considered: the leading-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) color-singlet and color-octet contributions, the cluster collapse mechanism, and the non-prompt $J/ψ$ from $b$-hadron decays. The simulated inclusive $J/ψ$ transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) differential cross sections agree well with the experimental data at both the middle and forward rapidities. For the $J/ψ$ yield, the dominant contribution comes from the NRQCD channel, while the cluster collapse and non-prompt processes provide relatively minor contributions. A decomposition of the NRQCD component, comprising direct production from the parton hard scattering and feed-down from $ψ(2S)$, $χ_{c0}$, $χ_{c1}$, and $χ_{c2}$, reveals that at low (high) $p_{\rm T}$ the dominant contributions come from the direct production and $χ_{c2}$ ($χ_{c1}$) feed-down. The $ψ(2S)$ feed-down fraction is 8-9$\%$, while the $χ_{c0}$ contribution is around 2-3$\%$. The influence of the partonic and hadronic rescatterings is also examined. The partonic rescattering exhibits negligible impact on the $J/ψ$ yields across all production mechanisms. In contrast, the hadronic rescattering suppresses the $J/ψ$ productions from both the NRQCD and cluster collapse mechanisms, while leaving the non-prompt $J/ψ$ yield almost unaffected.

### [15] [Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field in frame of three-flavor Polyakov-extended Nambu-Jona-Lasino model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14150)
*Luyang Li,Shijun Mao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates the mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons K₀, π₀, η, η' under finite temperature and magnetic fields using a three-flavor PNJL model. The analysis incorporates gluon effects through the Polyakov potential and inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC), revealing how these factors influence meson masses and transition temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay of chiral symmetry restoration, U_A(1) anomaly, flavor mixing, and magnetic field effects on meson properties in high-temperature and magnetic field environments, crucial for heavy-ion collision studies and QCD phase transitions.

Method: A three-flavor PNJL model is employed with the Polyakov loop potential simulating gluon dynamics and magnetic-field-dependent coupling constants to model IMC. Mass spectra and Mott transitions of K₀, π₀, η, η' mesons are analyzed across varying temperature and magnetic field conditions.

Result: K₀ mass increases at low temperatures, exhibits a Mott transition jump, then decreases before rising again with temperature. π₀ mass decreases at high temperatures due to flavor mixing. η shows a temperature-dependent drop, Mott jump, and subsequent trend similar to K₀. η' mass continuously decreases then increases. Magnetic fields lower Mott transition temperatures for K₀ and π₀ but raise that of η via quark dimension reduction.

Conclusion: The PNJL model successfully captures meson mass behavior under extreme conditions, highlighting the roles of IMC, chiral symmetry, and flavor mixing. Magnetic fields significantly alter Mott transition temperatures, emphasizing their importance in medium modifications of meson properties.

Abstract: Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons $K_0, π_0, η, η'$ at finite temperature and magnetic field are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model. We focus on the effect of gluons, which is simulated by the Polyakov potential and the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect, which is mimicked by using a magnetic field dependent coupling constant. Mass spectra show similar structure when introducing the contribution of Polyakov potential and IMC effect. The mass of $K_0$ meson $m_{K_0}$ is controlled by chiral symmetry breaking and restoration. It increases with temperature in the low temperature region, and shows a mass jump at the Mott transition. Further increasing temperature, $m_{K_0}$ firstly decreases and then increases with temperature. $π_0$ meson is not only the pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, but also influenced by the flavor mixing of $π_0-η-η'$. The behavior of $m_{π_0}$ is different from $m_{K_0}$ only at high temperature region, which decreases with temperature. For $η$ and $η'$ mesons, they are affected by both the $U_A(1)$ anomaly and the flavor mixing of $π_0-η-η'$. The mass of $η$ meson $m_η$ decreases with temperature in low temperature region and then shows a jump at its Mott transition. After that $m_η$ firstly decreases and later increases with temperature. $η'$ mesons is a resonant state in vacuum and in medium, and its mass $m_{η'}$ continuously decreases and then increases with temperature. The mass jumps of $K_0, π_0, η$ mesons are caused by the dimension reduction of the constituent quarks under external magnetic field. In the PNJL model, the Mott transition temperature of $K_0,\ π_0$ mesons ($ η$ meson) decrease (increases) with magnetic field. The IMC effect leads to the lower value for meson Mott transition temperature.

### [16] [Systematic analysis of $D_{(s)}$ meson semi-leptonic decays in the covariant light-front quark model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14165)
*Hao Yang,Shao-Qin Guo,Zhi-Qing Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates semi-leptonic decays of D_{(s)} mesons into various meson types using the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM). It calculates form factors and branching ratios, finding agreement with most experimental/theoretical results except for certain scalar (S) and axial-vector (A) transitions where discrepancies highlight the need for further study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the Standard Model and potential New Physics through D_{(s)} meson decays, leveraging experimental data from BESIII and providing a detailed theoretical framework for understanding meson structures and decay dynamics.

Method: The covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM) is applied to calculate form factors and branching ratios for semi-leptonic decays of D_{(s)} mesons into P, S, V, and A mesons. Results are compared with experimental data and other theoretical models.

Result: CLFQM results for D_{(s)}→P, V transitions match other theories/experiments, but significant differences emerge for S and A transitions (e.g., D→a₀(980), a₀(1450), D_{(s)}→K_{1B}). Branching ratios for P/V decays align well with data, while S/V decays show theoretical/experimental inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The CLFQM reliably models most D_{(s)} decays but reveals discrepancies in scalar/axial-vector transitions, suggesting complexities in their internal structures. The study offers critical guidance for future experimental investigations and theoretical developments.

Abstract: The weak decays of the $D_{(s)}$ meson provide a pivotal platform to advance our understanding of the Standard Model (SM) and to explore New Physics (NP). In recent years, experiments have collected a significant amount of data on the $D_{(s)}$ meson decays, particularly from BESIII, which provides substantial support for theoretical research. In this work, we systematically investigate the semi-leptonic decays of $D_{(s)}$ meson to pseudoscalar (P), scalar (S), vector (V), and axial-vector (A) mesons within the framework of the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM). We calculate the form factors of the transitions $D_{(s)}\to P,S,V,A$ and the branching ratios of the corresponding semi-leptonic decays, then compare them with experimental data and results from other theoretical models. The form factor values of the transitions $D_{(s)}\to P, V$ obtained from the CLFQM are consistent with those of other theoretical models and available data in most cases. However, significant discrepancies are found in some specific $D_{(s)}\to S,A$ transitions, such as $D\to a_0(980), a_0(1450)$ and $D_{(s)} \to K_{1B}$, compared to other theoretical calculations. The predicted branching ratios for the semi-leptonic decays $D\to P(V)\ellν_\ell$ with $\ell=e,μ$ agree well with experimental data and other theoretical results in most decay channels, validating the reliability of the model. However, for some $D\to S(V)\ellν_\ell$ decays, tension exists among different theoretical predictions and experimental results. Further clarification of such differences is necessary. Our study provides important insights into the internal structures for some scalar and axial-vector mesons and serves as a theoretical reference for future experiments.

### [17] [Chiral Evolution and Femtoscopic Signatures of the $K_1(1270)$ Resonance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14380)
*Jia-Ming Xie,Zhi-Wei Liu,Jun-Xu Lu,Haozhao Liang,Raquel Molina,Li-Sheng Geng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses unitarized chiral perturbation theory to study the K₁(1270) axial-vector resonance, revealing its two-pole structure and chiral evolution. Analysis of dominant channels (ρK, K*π) shows distinct pole behaviors with varying pion mass, validated through femtoscopic observables. The two-channel model sufficiently captures resonance dynamics, bridging lattice-QCD and experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the two-pole structure of K₁(1270), trace its chiral evolution with pion mass variations, and validate its molecular nature through femtoscopic observables, while connecting theoretical frameworks (lattice-QCD, chiral theory) with experiments.

Method: Unitarized chiral perturbation theory applied to coupled ρK and K*π channels. Vector-meson masses from lattice-QCD data and experiments. Calculated femtoscopic correlation functions (CFs) for various channels; analyzed pole trajectories considering finite widths.

Result: Two poles identified: lower pole transitions from resonance to bound state with increasing pion mass (dominant K*π coupling); higher pole moves downward due to chiral attraction (dominant ρK coupling). Finite widths smooth trajectories but don't change qualitative trends. Higher channels (e.g., ω̄K) have minimal impact, validating two-channel approach. Femtoscopic CFs align with two-pole dynamics.

Conclusion: The two-pole structure of K₁(1270) is decisively linked to chiral dynamics. The combined framework of chiral extrapolation and femtoscopic analysis provides a robust method to bridge lattice-QCD, theory, and experiments, confirming the resonance's molecular nature and chiral origins.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the axial-vector resonance $K_1(1270)$ within the unitarized chiral perturbation theory, focusing on its two-pole structure and manifestation in femtoscopic observables. By considering the dominant $ρK$ and $K^*π$ coupled channels, we reproduce the well-established double-pole structure and trace the chiral evolution of both poles as functions of the pion mass, using the vector-meson mass trajectories fitted to lattice-QCD data and experimental values. The lower pole, dominantly coupled to $K^*π$, evolves from an above-threshold resonance to a virtual or bound state with increasing pion mass. In comparison, the higher pole, dominantly coupled to $ρK$, moves downward in energy, reflecting the strengthening of the chiral attraction. The influence of the finite vector-meson widths is systematically examined, showing that their inclusion smooths the pole trajectories without altering their qualitative behavior. Furthermore, femtoscopic CFs are calculated for all relevant vector-pseudoscalar channels in both charged sectors. The results exhibit distinct resonance and bound-state features consistent with the two-pole dynamics. The weak impact of higher channels, such as $ω\bar{K}$, $\bar{K}^*η$, and $φ\bar{K}$, confirms that the simplified two-channel treatment captures the essential dynamics of the $K_1(1270)$ resonance. This study demonstrates that combining chiral extrapolation and femtoscopic correlation analyses provides a powerful and complementary framework for connecting lattice-QCD calculations, chiral effective theory, and experimental measurements, offering new insights into the molecular nature and chiral origin of the $K_1(1270)$ resonance.

### [18] [Probing Saturon-like Limits in QCD Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14381)
*Wei Kou,Xurong Chen*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Protons and nuclei are analyzed to test the 'saturon' criterion (when QCD matter reaches entropy/occupancy ~1/αs). Proton occupancies remain below 1/αs, but nuclei reach this benchmark at small x, suggesting nuclei are better for observing saturon behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if nuclei, unlike protons, enter a saturated regime (saturon criterion) at small x, which justifies high-occupancy collisions for studying QCD saturation.

Method: Used analytic/numerical solutions of the BK equation to compute gluon occupancy (N_g) and entropy (S) using Unruh-like temperature and emergent gluon mass.

Result: Proton N_g/S stay below 1/α_s; nuclear entropy S_A reaches 1/α_s at small x where protons don't. Establishes nuclei as optimal for saturon studies.

Conclusion: Precision small-x measurements and pA/AA collisions with nuclei are crucial for observing saturon-like behavior in saturated QCD matter.

Abstract: High-occupancy QCD matter enters a saturated regime when its entropy or occupancy approaches the unitarity bound $\sim 1/α$, the ``saturon" criterion. We test this criterion for protons and nuclei at small $x$ using analytic and numerical solutions of the BK equation. From these solutions we construct the gluon occupancy $N_g(x)$ and a thermodynamic entropy $S(x)$ via an Unruh-like temperature $T = Q_s/(2π)$ and an emergent gluon mass $M_g \sim Q_s$. For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/α_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/α_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.

### [19] [Correction to $CP$-asymmetry in $Υ(4S)$ decays due to the admixture of $B^0 \bar B^0$ in a $C$-even state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14384)
*N. A. Panchenko,S. I. Godunov*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of a small C-even state admixture on time-dependent CP-asymmetry in Υ(4S) → BB decays, caused by soft photon emission. Analytical expressions are derived using a two-particle wave function approach, highlighting the strong energy dependence of the admixture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how soft photon emission introduces a C-even component in otherwise C-odd BB pairs, and quantify its effect on CP-violation measurements through modified CP-asymmetries.

Method: Two-particle wave function formalism is applied to derive analytical expressions for CP-asymmetry in both pure C-odd and mixed C-parity states, analyzing energy dependence of the admixture.

Result: Derived formulas show significant energy-dependent modifications to CP-asymmetry due to C-even admixture, indicating necessary corrections for precise CP-violation studies.

Conclusion: Soft photon-induced C-even admixture cannot be neglected in high-precision CP-asymmetry measurements, emphasizing rigorous consideration of energy dependence in experimental analyses.

Abstract: $BB$ pairs from $Υ(4S)\to BB$ decays are in $C$-odd state. However, there is a small admixture of the $C$-even state and it modifies the time dependent $CP$-asymmetry. The $C$-even component appears due to soft photon emission, breaking the pure $C$-odd nature of the initial state. Using the two-particle wave function formalism, we derive analytical expressions for $CP$-asymmetry in both pure and mixed $C$-parity states. We emphasize the strong energy dependence of the admixture magnitude.

### [20] [Parton distributions with higher twist and jet power corrections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14387)
*Richard D. Ball,Amedeo Chiefa,Roy Stegeman*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a global determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) incorporating higher twist corrections in DIS and linear power corrections for LHC jet data, using a theory covariance formalism. This reduces sensitivity to low-x and low-p_T data, improving PDF accuracy and perturbative convergence for Higgs production and α_s determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Account for higher twist and power corrections in PDF determinations to reduce uncertainties from low-x DIS and low-p_T jet data, improving the reliability of LHC predictions.

Method: Applied the theory covariance formalism to include higher twist corrections in DIS and linear power corrections for single/dijet LHC data. Correlated uncertainties were systematically propagated into PDF fits.

Result: Improved data description with reduced PDF dependence on problematic low-x and low-p_T regions. Small but significant effects on Higgs production (gluon fusion) and α_s extraction, enhancing perturbative convergence.

Conclusion: Incorporating power corrections via covariance formalism provides a more robust PDF framework, reducing experimental dependences and improving precision for LHC observables like Higgs production and strong coupling constant determinations.

Abstract: We present a global determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) that accounts for higher twist corrections in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and linear power corrections for single inclusive jet and dijet production data from the LHC. We determine these corrections and their associated correlated uncertainties using a methodology based on the theory covariance formalism, previously used to account for nuclear uncertainties and missing higher order uncertainties (MHOUs) in global PDF determinations. We then study the impact of the power corrections on the extracted PDFs, and demonstrate an improved description of the data due to a reduced sensitivity to DIS data in the low-$x$ region where higher twist uncertainties are relatively large, and a reduced sensitivity to single inclusive jet data at relatively low $p_T$, where linear power corrections can be significant. Finally, we assess the impact of power corrections on observables relevant to LHC phenomenology, including Higgs production via gluon fusion, and the determination of $α_s$. We find that these effects, while small, can be significant, improving perturbative convergence.

*Khiem Hong Phan,Quang Hoang-Minh Pham*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes charged Higgs pair production with neutral gauge bosons at future muon colliders using the Type-X Two-Higgs-Doublet Model, considering loop corrections and showing potential 5σ observability with high luminosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of detecting charged Higgs bosons and constrain the parameter space of the Type-X THDM using the unique environment of multi-TeV muon colliders, leveraging precise theoretical calculations with loop corrections.

Method: Updated Type-X THDM parameter space analysis; computed production cross sections including charged Higgs two-body decays with one-loop electroweak and two-loop QCD corrections. Evaluated signal significances for benchmark points with initial-state radiation up to two-loops.

Result: For selected parameter regions within theoretical/experimental constraints, Higgs pair production signals achieve >5σ significance at future muon colliders with planned luminosities.

Conclusion: Future muon colliders could confirm charged Higgs existence and probe THDM parameter space through these pair production channels, emphasizing the necessity of advanced collider facilities for beyond-Standard-Model physics.

Abstract: The first results for charged Higgs pair production associated with neutral gauge bosons at future multi--TeV muon colliders are presented within the framework of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. In the phenomenological studies for the production processes, we first update the parameter space of the Type-X Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. From the viable regions of the parameter space, we compute the production cross sections, including all two-body decay modes of the charged Higgs boson. We mention that all two-body decay modes of the charged Higgs boson are evaluated with one-loop electroweak corrections, with two-loop QCD corrections also included for the decays of the charged Higgs into two fermions. The signal significances are also examined for several benchmark points within the updated parameter space. It is worth emphasizing that the production cross sections used for computing the significances in this work include initial-state radiation corrections up to two-loop order. With the help of the high integrated luminosity planned for future multi--TeV muon colliders, the production signals can be observed with a statistical significance exceeding $5σ$ for several selected points within the allowed parameter space.

*Partha Kumar Paul,Sujit Kumar Sahoo,Narendra Sahu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study explores the singlet-doublet dark matter model focusing on Majorana DM, expanding the allowed parameter space for DM mass (1-1750 GeV) and mixing angle compared to Dirac DM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the nature of dark matter (Majorana vs Dirac) affects the parameter space in singlet-doublet models, particularly regarding relic density and direct detection constraints.

Method: Analyzes the singlet-doublet DM model with Majorana fermions, considering parameters ΔM, sinθ, and M_DM. Computes allowed ranges under relic density and direct detection constraints.

Result: Majorana DM allows broader parameter ranges: M_DM up to 1750 GeV and sinθ up to 0.16, compared to Dirac's 750 GeV and 0.04. Valid for ΔM >1 GeV.

Conclusion: Majorana nature of DM significantly extends viable parameter space, offering better compatibility with observational constraints and experimental searches.

Abstract: The singlet-doublet dark matter model offers a rich framework for exploring the nature of dark matter (DM) through its unique fermion structure. In this model, the important parameters are singlet-doublet mass splitting $Δ{M}$, singlet-doublet mixing angle $\sinθ$, and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$. If the DM is assumed to be of Dirac nature, then the annihilation, co-annihilation, and conversion driven processes combinedly allows a range of parameter space: $1~{\rm GeV} \lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim750$ GeV and $10^{-6}\lesssim\sinθ\lesssim0.04$ for all $Δ{M}>1$ GeV. While the nature of DM either Dirac or Majorana is not known, in this work we assume the nature of singlet-doublet DM to be of Majorana type and find that the relic density and direct detection can be satisfied in a larger parameter space. In particular, the allowed ranges of DM mass and $\sinθ$ are: $1~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim1750$ GeV and $2\times10^{-7}\lesssim\sinθ\lesssim0.16$ for all $Δ{M}>1$ GeV.

*E. J. Ferrer,J. M. Perez-Fernandez*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how dense quark matter in the dual chiral density wave phase exhibits permanent magnetization even in zero external magnetic fields, linked to spontaneous generation of strong magnetic and electric fields relevant for magnetars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the ferromagnetic behavior of dense quark matter in the DCDW phase and its implications for spontaneous magnetic field generation in compact stars like magnetars.

Method: Analyzes the magnetic-field dependent magnetization of quark matter at varying baryonic chemical potential, incorporating axial anomaly effects.

Result: Permanent magnetization persists at B→0 within specific μ ranges (312-342 MeV and 490-550 MeV), enabling spontaneous generation of up to 10¹⁶ G magnetic fields coupled with weaker electric fields.

Conclusion: DCDW phase's ability to induce magnetic fields removes Landau-Peierls instability, offering insights into magnetar magnetic field origins via spontaneous field generation mechanisms.

Abstract: In this paper, we will demonstrate that a dense quark-matter system in the dual chiral density wave (DCDW) phase behaves as a ferromagnet in the sense that its magnetic-field dependent magnetization remains different from zero even at $B\rightarrow 0$. The corresponding permanent magnetization is a function of the baryonic chemical potential $μ$, decreasing up to zero as $μ$ increases in the range of intermediate densities ($312$ MeV $\leqslant μ\leqslant 342$ MeV) and then increasing from zero in the higher density interval $490$ MeV$\leqslant μ\leqslant 550$ MeV. We will show that this system's ability to generate permanent magnetization, together with the existence of the axial anomaly, open up the possibility of spontaneously generating a magnetic field coupled to a collinear electric field. The generated magnetic field can reach values up to $10^{16}$ G, depending on $μ$, and the electric field will be 3 orders smaller. The fact that the DCDW phase is able to induce a magnetic field can be seen as its spontaneous tendency to remove the so called Landau-Peierls instability that is present in this single-modulated phase in the absence of a magnetic field. The spontaneous induction of a strong magnetic field at intermediate to high densities can be of interest for the astrophysics of compact stellar objects exhibiting strong magnetic fields as magnetars.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyses unpolarized J/ψ production in proton-proton collisions using the Soft Gluon Resummation (TMD framework) for small-pT cross sections and the Improved Color Evaporation model for hadronization. It finds energy dependence in the hadronization parameter F, with predictions for SPD NICA experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand small-pT J/ψ production mechanisms and validate theoretical models against experimental data across different energies, providing predictive results for upcoming experiments like SPD NICA.

Method: Combines the Soft Gluon Resummation approach (for TMD description) with the Improved Color Evaporation model (for hadronization). Analyzes experimental data at varied √s energies to study energy dependence of F^{J/ψ}.

Result: Observed that the hadronization parameter F^{J/ψ} varies with center-of-mass energy. Generated predictions for J/ψ production in SPD NICA's kinematic conditions.

Conclusion: The energy dependence of F^{J/ψ} indicates that hadronization dynamics are energy-dependent, requiring further model refinement. The predictive framework can guide SPD NICA experimental planning and data interpretation.

Abstract: In the article, the study of unpolarized $J/ψ$ production in proton-proton collisions is presented. The Soft Gluon Resummation approach as a TMD framework was used for description of small-$p_T^{}$ production cross section. The Improved Color Evaporation model was considered as an approach to describe hadronization of produced quarks into charmonium state. We find that the experimental data at various center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ demonstrate the dependence of hadronization parameter $F^{J/ψ}$ on energy. The predictions for $J/ψ$ production in the kinematics of the SPD NICA experiment have been made.

### [25] [Probing the Phenomenology of Dark Matter from Decoupled Freeze-Out](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14635)
*Geneviève Bélanger,Aoife Bharucha,Sreemanti Chakraborti,Rashidul Islam,Sophie Mutzel*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a decoupled freeze out (DFO) mechanism in a dark matter model with a scalar-pseudoscalar mediator, where the dark sector reaches thermal equilibrium independently from the Standard Model. This allows evasion of CMB constraints while maintaining detectable signals. By solving coupled Boltzmann equations, the study identifies viable parameter spaces surviving experimental bounds from CMB, indirect detection, and BBN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate scenarios where dark matter relic density avoids CMB constraints through decoupled freeze out, enabled by a mediator with both scalar and pseudoscalar components and asymmetric thermal histories between dark and visible sectors.

Method: Solving four coupled Boltzmann equations to track dark sector particle number densities and energy transfer. Analyzing parameter space against CMB, BBN, and indirect detection constraints.

Result: Identified viable parameter regions that satisfy relic density requirements while evading experimental bounds. Significant constraints exist but some exploration opportunities remain.

Conclusion: DFO is a promising mechanism for dark matter models with strong self-interactions, offering a pathway to observable signals without violating cosmological constraints.

Abstract: We consider a model of dark matter where the mediator corresponds to a superposition of a scalar and pseudoscalar, and the scenario where, after reheating, the number densities of the dark sector particles, i.e. the dark matter and the mediators, are negligible. If the coupling of the mediators to the Standard Model is feeble, but the coupling to the dark matter is large enough, the dark sector may reach equilibrium at a temperature distinct from that of the thermal bath. The relic density is then said to be obtained via decoupled freeze out (DFO). We focus on the $s$-wave annihilation scenario, which particularly benefits from the DFO mechanism by evading standard CMB limits while still yielding indirect detection signals. We calculate the relic density by solving a set of four coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities of the dark sector particles and the energy transfer from the light to dark sector. We finally perform a thorough analysis of experimental bounds on this scenario, namely from indirect detection and the CMB, as well as from BBN, and find that, while there are considerable constraints on the parameter space where the correct relic density is obtained, a viable region remains to be explored.

*Gregory Patellis,Danai Roumelioti,Stelios Stefas,George Zoupanos*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the unification of Conformal Gravity and Fuzzy (Noncommutative) Gravity with internal interactions, leveraging their gauge-theoretic formulations and differing tangent group dimensions. It proposes an extension of four-dimensional tangent groups, examines low-energy behavior through spontaneous symmetry breaking, and discusses cosmic string signals in gravitational waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify two gravitational theories (Conformal and Fuzzy Gravity) with internal interactions by exploiting their common gauge-theoretic structure and the dimensionality difference between tangent groups and manifolds. This aims to create a more comprehensive framework for high-energy physics and cosmological phenomena.

Method: 1. Review gauge-theoretic approaches to gravity focusing on diffeomorphism invariance. 2. Reconstruct Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities within this framework. 3. Extend four-dimensional tangent groups to unify both gravities with internal interactions. 4. Analyze low-energy behavior via spontaneous symmetry breaking. 5. Investigate cosmic string signatures in gravitational wave data.

Result: A unified framework combining Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with internal forces, predicting specific low-energy behaviors and observable cosmic string effects in gravitational waves. Theoretical consistency and viability under symmetry breaking scenarios are demonstrated.

Conclusion: The successful unification suggests a path toward quantum gravity theories and provides testable predictions about cosmic strings detectable via gravitational wave observations, offering new avenues for high-energy physics and cosmology.

Abstract: The Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy gravities with Internal Interactions is based on the following two facts. The first is that the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions. The second is that both gravitational theories considered here have been formulated in a gauge theoretic way. Here we would like to start by reviewing the gauge theoretic approach of gravities commenting in particular their diffeomorphism invariance. Then we will review the construction of the Conformal Gravity and the Noncommutative (Fuzzy) Gravity using the gauge theoretic framework. Finally based on an extension of the four-dimensional tangent group we will present the Unification of both Gravities with the Internal Interactions. Both unified schemes will be examined further concerning their behaviour in low energies after suitable spontaneous symmetry breakings as well as the possible signals of the related cosmic strings in the gravitational waves.

### [27] [Twisting asymptotically-flat spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13814)
*Marc Geiller,Pujian Mao,Antoine Vincenti*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper extends the Bondi formalism to handle asymptotically-flat spacetimes with non-vanishing twist by introducing a twist potential in the Newman-Penrose and metric formulations. This allows for algebraically special solutions like Kerr-Taub-NUT and enhances understanding of asymptotic symmetries and flux-balance laws, with applications in flat holography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize Bondi's framework to spacetimes with twisted null congruences, enabling analysis of solutions with non-zero twist such as Kerr-Taub-NUT, and to explore their asymptotic properties and symmetries.

Method: Extended Bondi hierarchy using Newman-Penrose formalism with a twist potential (Im(ρ)) and metric terms (g_{ra}≠0). Derived equations for solution space, flux-balance laws, and asymptotic symmetries, incorporating Carrollian connections and finite radial expansions.

Result: Successful extension of Bondi formalism to include twist effects, Carroll boosts as new symmetries, explicit treatment of algebraically special solutions, and 8D solution space in 3D cosmological contexts. Enables straightforward study of supertranslated Schwarzschild solutions.

Conclusion: The generalized Bondi gauge provides a robust framework for algebraically special spacetimes, advancing holography and perturbation studies. Future applications include deeper insights into gravitational physics and symmetries in flat and curved spacetimes.

Abstract: We extend the Bondi formalism to describe asymptotically-flat spacetimes where the outgoing null geodesic congruence is not hypersurface-orthogonal, i.e. has a non-vanishing twist. In the Newman-Penrose formulation, the twist $\text{Im}(ρ)$ is sourced by a twist potential sitting in the transverse null dyad $(m,\bar{m})$, while in the metric formulation this potential arises from $g_{ra}\neq0$. We explain how to arrange and solve the Einstein equations for such generalized line elements, thereby providing an extension of the Bondi hierarchy to asymptotically-flat spacetimes with non-vanishing twist. We work out the twisting generalizations of all the well-known features pertaining to asymptotically-flat spacetimes in Bondi gauge, such as the solution space, the flux-balance laws, the asymptotic symmetries, and the transformation laws. The twist potential has a natural Carrollian interpretation as an Ehresmann connection, and gives rise to Carroll boosts as extra asymptotic symmetries. One of the advantages of the Bondi gauge with non-vanishing twist is that it allows to write algebraically special solutions in a manifestly finite radial expansion, and with a repeated principal null direction such that $Ψ_0=Ψ_1=0$. This is in particular the case for the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution. The asymptotic symmetries of algebraically special solutions also have a finite radial expansion, which enables to study the supertranslated Schwarzschild solution and its charges quite straightforwardly. We expect that these results will find applications in the development of flat holography for algebraically special solutions and in the study of their perturbations. We also study an analogue of the twist in three-dimensional spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant, and find an 8-dimensional solution space which encompasses and generalizes the existing results in the literature.

*Saul A. Teukolsky*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using quasi-invertible transformations from comoving frames to derive characteristic decompositions, starting with relativistic hydrodynamics, and extending to GRMHD in future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of known characteristic decompositions for GRMHD limits the use of accurate Riemann solvers in numerical simulations.

Method: The method involves transformations from comoving frames where fluid flow is simpler and known decompositions exist, with a focus on quasi-invertible transformations demonstrated through relativistic hydrodynamics examples.

Result: Recovered relativistic hydrodynamics decomposition in simpler form and derived new results for fluids in nuclear statistical equilibrium.

Conclusion: Successfully developed framework to derive GRMHD characteristic decomposition, with full results to follow in subsequent paper.

Abstract: The characteristic decomposition for GRMHD is not known in a form useful for current numerical simulations. This prevents us from using the most accurate known computational methods, such as full-wave Riemann solvers. In this paper, we present a new method of finding decompositions. The method is based on transformations from the comoving frame, where the fluid flow is simplest and the decomposition has been known for a long time. The key innovation we introduce is that of quasi-invertible transformations. In this first paper, we introduce these transformations using the simpler example of relativistic hydrodynamics. We recover the known decomposition for relativistic hydrodynamics in somewhat simpler form than previously derived, and without the need for computer algebra. A new result in this paper is the characteristic decomposition when the the evolution tracks the composition of a fluid in nuclear statistical equilibrium. In Paper II of this series, we apply a quasi-invertible transformation to derive the complete characteristic decomposition for GRMHD in the conserved variables used in simulations.

TL;DR: The paper derives the characteristic decomposition of GRMHD in the simulation's coordinate frame using quasi-invertible transformations, enabling accurate Riemann solvers and yielding simpler results than prior attempts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the use of precise computational methods like full-wave Riemann solvers by providing a coordinate frame decomposition of GRMHD in terms of conserved variables, which was previously unknown despite existing fluid frame decompositions.

Method: Applies quasi-invertible transformations (from Paper I) to derive characteristic decomposition in the simulation coordinate frame using conserved variables.

Result: Successfully derived decomposition with simpler results than previous efforts, facilitating implementation of advanced numerical methods.

Conclusion: The derived decomposition advances numerical GRMHD simulations by enabling more accurate solvers with unexpectedly simple mathematical expressions.

Abstract: The characteristic decomposition for GRMHD in the comoving frame of the fluid has been known for a long time. However, it has not been known in the coordinate frame of the simulation and in terms of the conserved variables evolved in typical numerical simulations. This paper applies the method of quasi-invertible transformations developed in Paper I to derive this decomposition. Among other benefits, this will allow us to use the most accurate known computational methods, such as full-wave Riemann solvers. The results turn out to be simpler than expected based on earlier attempts.

### [30] [Extremal isolated horizons of the NUT type](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13842)
*Eryk Buk,Denis Dobkowski-Ryłko,Jerzy Lewandowski,Maciej Ossowski*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of axisymmetric extremal isolated horizons with a U(1)-principal fiber bundle structure over a two-sphere, where null generators are transversal to bundle fibers. It derives all intrinsic geometries under Einstein equations, showing equivalence to conically singular horizons of product topology. These horizons are embedded in Plebański-Demiański spacetimes and compared to existing solutions under Einstein's equations and Petrov type D conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new geometric structures of extremal horizons beyond previous examples by considering transversal null generators and their embedding in known spacetimes, while addressing completeness of horizon geometries under Einstein equations.

Method: Imposing Einstein equations at the horizon to derive explicit intrinsic geometries (2-sphere metric and rotation 1-form) for the proposed class, and embedding results in Plebański-Demiański spacetimes. The approach involves classifying conically singular horizons and comparing with existing Petrov type D solutions.

Result: All intrinsic geometries are fully derived and shown equivalent to conically singular horizons with product topology. Successful embedding in Plebański-Demiański spacetimes is demonstrated, along with distinctions from prior solutions.

Conclusion: The study expands the understanding of extremal horizon geometries by introducing a new transversal bundle structure and confirming their compatibility with specific spacetimes, providing a bridge between classifications under Einstein equations and Petrov types.

Abstract: We provide a construction of a new class of axisymmetric extremal isolated horizons admitting a structure of U(1)-principal fiber bundle over a two-sphere. In contrast to the previous examples, the null generators are assumed to be transversal to the bundle fibers. We impose the Einstein equations at the horizon and explicitly derive all intrinsic geometries of the extremal horizon, consisting of a two-sphere metric and a rotation 1-form, in the above class. The 2-geometries turn out to be equivalent to the classification of conically singular horizons with product topology. Both the rotating and non-rotating horizons are then embedded in the Plebański-Demiański spacetimes, which naturally admit horizons of this type. Furthermore, we compare our results with previously obtained solutions to the Einstein vacuum extremal horizon equation with cosmological constant and the solution of Petrov type D equation with transversal bundle structure.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates how light scalar field clouds around black holes (gravitational atoms) affect quasi-normal mode frequencies of spacetime, showing that compactness of these clouds causes detectable frequency shifts in gravitational waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand observational signatures of gravitational atoms, which are scalar field clouds around black holes, by analyzing their quasi-normal mode frequencies.

Method: Computed axial quasi-normal modes in time and frequency domains using fully relativistic calculations for self-gravitating scalar configurations, comparing shifts to vacuum solutions.

Result: Frequency shifts of quasi-normal modes depend heavily on gravitational atom compactness; sufficiently compact clouds could produce detectable shifts for gravitational wave detectors.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave observations may soon probe the existence of scalar clouds around black holes through these frequency shifts, offering new tests of gravity theories and astrophysical insights.

Abstract: Black holes in our Universe are rarely truly isolated, being instead embedded in astrophysical environments such as plasma or dark matter. A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors.

TL;DR: The paper explores the Hermitian formulation of interacting mass dimension one fermions using Elko spinors, addressing renormalizability and interactions, and extends this framework to curved spacetime and quantum gravity considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in formulating interacting mass dimension one fermions, particularly Elko spinors, and to incorporate curved spacetime and quantum gravity effects relevant to dark matter phenomenology.

Method: The authors perform a partial review of Elko's Hermiticity, develop a Hermitian formulation for interacting Elko fermions, analyze renormalizability, and extend the framework to curved spacetime using path-integral methods.

Result: They establish the Hermitian prescription for Elko spinors in interacting scenarios, demonstrate its compatibility with curved spacetime, and propose a path toward integrating quantum gravity.

Conclusion: The Hermitian approach provides a robust foundation for studying mass dimension one fermions in both flat and curved spacetimes, advancing potential connections to dark matter and quantum gravity research.

Abstract: Throughout this paper, we conduct our discussion by a partial review of Elko's Hermiticity, introducing the Hermitian formulation for interacting mass dimension one fermions based on Elko spinor. It includes pivotal observations about renormalizability and the study of some allowed interactions. Beyond these points, since dark-matter phenomenology is mainly connected to gravitation, we introduce original remarks on how the Hermitian prescription can be readily generalized to include curved space-time, considering the very definition of the Elko spinor structure. We establish the Elko dual as arising from the path-integral formulation of a more fundamental structure. It enables one to include a curved background space-time and also quantum gravity into our investigations.

### [33] [Phase Space of SdS Geodesics and using the Cosmological Horizon to Observe a Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13995)
*Bela Nelson,Allison Powell,Jennie Traschen*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how observers in Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetime can use the blueshift from the cosmological horizon to detect otherwise unobservable signals near a black hole horizon, identifying optimal observation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the near-horizon region of a black hole can be observed using the blueshift effect from the cosmological horizon in SdS spacetime, addressing limitations caused by infinite redshift near the black hole horizon.

Method: Analyzes signal frequencies for accelerated and geodesic observers in SdS spacetime, investigates radial and circular geodesics, and identifies critical curves in orbital parameters to determine optimal observation conditions.

Result: Identifies a ``cresting-wave" critical curve in geodesic parameters, showing photon observation enhancement factors up to three when receivers are near the cosmological horizon moving toward the black hole.

Conclusion: A nonzero cosmological constant enables observation of black hole near-horizon emissions through strategic placement of receivers, overcoming redshift limitations via cosmological horizon blueshift.

Abstract: Light propagating from near a black hole horizon to the outside world is highly redshifted. In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present the first exact, non-singular black hole solution in General Relativity sourced by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field. Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores a non-local modified gravity theory with terms like RBox^{-2}R, which dynamically generates a massive graviton and exhibits a stable de Sitter attractor. It avoids ghost instabilities in cosmological perturbations and aligns with ΛCDM at late times, offering a viable alternative to scalar-tensor approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the universe's accelerated expansion challenge to General Relativity and provide an alternative to scalar-tensor models like f(R) and Galileons by exploring non-local gravity modifications.

Method: Investigates a non-local modified gravity action with specific tensor terms, linearizes to recover Fierz-Pauli actions, analyzes fixed-points in cosmology, examines perturbations to ensure stability and absence of ghosts.

Result: Demonstrates a stable de Sitter attractor for accelerated expansion, six stable propagating degrees of freedom without ghost instabilities, and late-time consistency with ΛCDM. Tensor modes are stable and decay appropriately.

Conclusion: The model is a theoretically consistent, robust alternative to ΛCDM and scalar-tensor models, offering unique gravitational wave predictions while maintaining stability at all levels.

Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe poses a significant challenge to General Relativity. Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{μν}\Box^{-2}R_{μν}$, $R^{μνσδ}\Box^{-2}R_{μνσδ}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\mathbf{ΛCDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm.

### [36] [Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations in $γ$-metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14080)
*Chao Zhang,Tao Zhu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates how deviations from the Schwarzschild metric (gamma ≠ 1) in the gamma-metric affect periodic orbits' properties and gravitational waveforms, showing that non-spherical spacetime can alter orbital parameters, zoom-whirl behavior, and waveform features, potentially allowing gamma to be constrained through precise gravitational wave measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore signatures of the gamma-metric's deformation parameter (gamma) on orbital dynamics and gravitational waves, enabling potential constraints on deviations from spherical symmetry in black hole spacetimes.

Method: Analyzing periodic orbits using topological numbers (z, w, v) to classify zoom-whirl behavior, calculating gravitational waveforms for selected orbits, and assessing how gamma deviations impact orbital parameters and waveform characteristics like phase shifts and amplitude modulations.

Result: Non-Schwarzschild gamma values alter orbital radii/angular momentum, shift orbital taxonomy, induce waveform phase/amplitude changes, and create complex waveform substructures linked to zoom numbers. These effects suggest gamma can be constrained via extreme-mass-ratio inspiral observations.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave measurements from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals could probe deviations from spherical symmetry by detecting gamma-induced modifications in waveform morphology, offering a new observational test of black hole spacetime properties.

Abstract: The gamma-metric, also known as Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, is a static, axially symmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's field equations characterized by two parameters: mass and the deformation parameter gamma. It reduces to the Schwarzschild metric when gamma = 1. In this paper we explore potential signatures of the gamma-metric on periodic orbits and their gravitational-wave radiation. Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy. We also compute representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits and demonstrate that gamma != 1 can induce phase shifts and amplitude modulations correlated with changes in the zoom-whirl structure. In particular, larger zoom numbers lead to increasingly complex substructures in the waveforms, and finite deviations from gamma=1 can significantly modify these features. Our results indicate that precise measurements of waveform morphology from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals may constrain deviations from spherical symmetry encoded in gamma.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores late-time interacting cosmologies in generalized Rastall gravity, using dynamical system analysis and observational data to study dark sector interactions and constraint model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how non-conserved energy-momentum in generalized Rastall gravity explains dark sector interactions, and to constrain cosmological models using observational data.

Method: Formulated dark sector evolution as an autonomous system with interaction terms Q1 and Q2 dependent on time-varying function f proportional to dark matter/dark energy densities or their sum. Used phase-space analysis to identify fixed points and stability, combined with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data for parameter estimation.

Result: Phase-space analysis showed standard radiation, matter saddle, and accelerated attractor points. Observational data constrained model parameters at 68% and 95% confidence levels.

Conclusion: Generalized Rastall gravity with specific interaction terms successfully describes late-time cosmological dynamics, with constrained parameter values supporting stable accelerated expansion attractors.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate late-time interacting cosmologies within the framework of generalized Rastall gravity, where the interaction arises naturally from the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q_1=α\,\dot{f}$ and $Q_2=-\dot{f}\,(1+α)$, with $α$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \propto ρ_m$, $f \propto ρ_{de}$, and $f \propto ρ_m + ρ_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(Ω_{de}, Ω_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model.

*Antonio De Felice,Shinji Tsujikawa*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that including a U(1) gauge field's field strength F in k-essence theories allows for static, charged compact stars with positive energy density without ghost instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the no-go theorem in k-essence theories which prohibits static compact objects with positive energy density by extending the Lagrangian to include gauge field terms.

Method: Extended Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with scalar-vector coupling μ(φ)F, constructing electric/magnetic compact star solutions analytically, calculating metric functions and field profiles, and performing linear perturbation analysis for stability.

Result: Constructed asymptotically flat charged compact stars with central vanishing density/pressure, compactness between 1%–10%, and showed electric solutions are stable (no ghost/Laplacian instabilities for μ(φ)>0), while magnetic ones have central strong coupling issues.

Conclusion: Including gauge field interactions in k-essence evades previous no-go results, enabling viable compact object solutions, but magnetic configurations require caution due to instabilities.

Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $φ$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(φ, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $μ(φ) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $μ(φ)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)<{\cal C}<{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $μ(φ)>0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method to construct solutions of the static spherically symmetric Einstein-Euler equations, addressing stellar phase transitions in General Relativity with discontinuous and non-uniform density functions. It introduces a generalized condition extending the classical Buchdahl limit for bounded pressure solutions and a new necessary condition that recovers the Buchdahl limit in uniform density cases, supported by examples analyzing mass-radius relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To construct general solutions of the TOV equations for stellar structures undergoing phase transitions with discontinuous/non-uniform densities, ensuring physically meaningful bounded pressure profiles from boundary to center, and to establish existence criteria that generalize classical bounds on mass-radius relationships.

Method: General construction framework applying to prescribed densities with discontinuities leading to phase transitions; develops a new boundedness condition for pressure based on density prescriptions, generalizing the classical Buchdahl limit; derives a novel necessary condition for solution existence which reduces to the standard Buchdahl limit for uniform densities.

Result: Demonstrates successful construction of solutions under broad density conditions, establishes generalized Buchdahl-type limits for non-uniform cases, and provides example configurations showing new mass-radius relationships beyond classical limits.

Conclusion: The approach effectively models phase transitions in relativistic stellar interiors, unifies classical and new cases in mass-radius constraints, and offers foundational tools for studying exotic stellar configurations through discontinuous density models.

Abstract: We give the first general construction of solutions of the static spherically symmetric Einstein-Euler equations, the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV-)equation, with prescribed density functions allowed to be discontinuous and non-uniform; these solutions describe stellar phase transitions in General Relativity. Boundedness of the resulting pressure functions solving the TOV-equations, from the boundary down to the stellar center, is obtained by identifying a novel condition on the prescribed density, in generalization of the classical Buchdahl limit. Moreover, we introduce a new necessary condition for the existence of such bounded pressure functions, which in the special case of a uniform density state reduces to the classical Buchdahl limit on the stellar mass-radius relationship. We present various examples to study the stellar mass-radius relationships resulting from our new conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the accelerating phase of the Universe within the context of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity theory, where $R$, $L_m$, and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar, matter Lagrangian, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. We focus on a particular form of modified gravity defined by $f(R,L_m,T) = R - μL_m T - γ$, with $μ$ and $γ$ being positive constants. The matter sector is characterized by the Lagrangian density $L_m = -ρ$, where $ρ$ denotes the energy density of the cosmological fluid. We conduct an in-depth examination of the model using phase space analysis, thoroughly evaluating the evolution of cosmological solutions with dynamical system techniques. The results is illustrated through graphs in the phase space, the characteristics of critical points and the stable attractors within the proposed modified gravity $f(R,L_m,T)$ cosmological framework. We investigate the transition from the initial decelerating phase of the universe to its current accelerating phase. The behaviour of the EoS, deceleration parameter with the appropriate initial conditions have been investigated.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how cold dark matter halos affect hot accretion flows onto supermassive black holes, finding that dense, compact halos boost disk luminosity, with inner flow regions contributing most. This suggests luminosity measurements could probe dark matter distributions near galaxy centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dark matter influences accretion processes and galactic evolution by studying its effect on SMBH accretion dynamics.

Method: Modeling spacetime around a SMBH embedded in various DM halos (including those with central spikes) to simulate relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid accretion flows and analyze luminosity changes.

Result: Massive, compact DM halos increase accretion disk luminosity, with luminous contributions primarily from inner flow regions.

Conclusion: Luminosity measurements of accretion disks could be an observational tool to infer dark matter density profiles near galactic centers.

Abstract: The interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their surrounding environment is fundamental to understanding galactic evolution. This work investigates the influence of a cold dark matter (DM) halo on the dynamics of relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic SMBH. Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers.

Abstract: We develop a fully relativistic approach for determining the frequency-dependent tidal response of a compact star. The strategy involves matching the solution for the linearised fluid dynamics in the star's interior to the spacetime perturbations in the near-zone surrounding the body, along with an identification of the tidal driving and the star's response. Notably, this identification is exact in Newtonian gravity and we provide strong evidence that it remains robust also in the relativistic case. The argument does not involve a sum over the star's quasinormal modes and hence circumvents one of the obstacles that have held up the development of models for relativistic tides. Numerical results are provided, at the proof-of-principle level, for a realistic matter equation of state from the BSk family, including composition stratification leading to the presence of low-frequency gravity modes. We also sketch the connection with the field-theory inspired approach to the problem, in which the tidal response is expressed in terms of asymptotic scattering amplitudes.

### [43] [The Cosmic Star Formation History: Insights from Kilonova-Associated Gamma-Ray Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13783)
*Qin-Mei Li,Qi-Bin Sun,Sheng-Bang Qian,Si-Yuan Zhu,Fu-Xing Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of kilonova-associated gamma-ray bursts (KN/GRBs) as tracers of the delayed star formation rate (SFR) in the universe. By focusing on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which are linked to binary compact star mergers, the study finds that their formation rate contradicts the expected trend with the delayed SFR at low redshifts (z < 1). This challenges the assumption that such GRBs reliably trace the delayed SFR, suggesting the need for further validation with larger datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in using short GRBs as delayed SFR tracers, particularly contamination from core-collapse events. The study seeks a more reliable method by exclusively analyzing KN/GRBs, which are unambiguously tied to binary compact mergers.

Method: The authors analyze a sample of KN/GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures. They compare the formation rate (FR) of these events against the delayed star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time, focusing on low-redshift data (z < 1).

Result: The KN/GRB FR shows a trend opposite to the expected delayed SFR at low redshifts. This discrepancy persists without contamination from core-collapse events, challenging conventional assumptions about their reliability as SFR tracers.

Conclusion: KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR at low redshifts, contradicting prior theories. Larger KN/GRB datasets are required to confirm this finding and refine their use in cosmological studies.

Abstract: The origin of the Universe and its material content remains one of the most fundamental questions in science. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and high-redshift detectability, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their $ T_{90} $ duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the $ T_{90} $ classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a kilonova-associated GRB (KN/GRBs) sample, we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts ($ z < 1 $). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study uses 16.7 years of Fermi-LAT data to show galaxy mergers are a new class of high-energy gamma-ray sources. 8 mergers exhibit detectable gamma-ray emission (>5σ), and a stacked analysis of fainter mergers gives a 35σ detection. The results suggest mergers host cosmic ray acceleration sites, with future CTA observations needed to confirm mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Galaxy mergers are theoretical sites for cosmic ray acceleration, producing gamma rays and neutrinos. Previous studies lacked systematic analysis of gamma-ray emission from mergers, so this work aims to confirm their role through Fermi-LAT data and set foundations for future neutrino/CTA observations.

Method: Analyzed 16.7 years of Fermi-LAT data across eight survey catalogs. Identified 8 mergers with >5σ gamma-ray emission. Performed stacking analysis on remaining mergers to achieve a 35σ significance detection. Compared spectral properties with CTA sensitivities and cross-matched Fermi sources with merger locations.

Result: Detected gamma rays from 8 mergers and a significant stacked signal from fainter mergers. Derived spectral index Γ≈2.07 and energy flux ~2e-14 erg/cm²/s. Found spatial coincidence of 18 unassociated Fermi sources with mergers, indicating potential new gamma-ray source candidates.

Conclusion: Galaxy mergers are confirmed as high-energy gamma-ray sources, supporting their role in cosmic ray acceleration. Future CTA observations will help unravel acceleration mechanisms, and joint neutrino analyses are needed to confirm astrophysical models.

Abstract: The origin and acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays (CRs) remain fundamental open questions. Galaxy mergers are proposed as very high-energy CR accelerators, which are expected to produce high-energy (HE) $γ$ rays and neutrinos through interactions with the ambient gas and low-energy background radiation fields. For the first time, we systematically study the HE $γ$-ray emission from galaxy mergers utilising 16.7 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) data with the sample list compiled from eight survey catalogs. Our analysis finds 8 galaxy mergers that exhibit $γ$-ray emission with significance $\gtrsim5σ$ in the 1-500 GeV energy range. A stacking analysis of the remaining faint galaxy mergers yields a combined $γ$-ray emission detected at $\sim 35σ$ significance, a best-fit spectral index of $Γ\approx 2.07$, and an energy flux of $\sim \rm 2\times10^{-14}~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. We compare the stacked spectral energy distributions of the galaxy mergers with the projected sensitivity of the upcoming $γ$-ray telescope Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Furthermore, we find that 18 previously unassociated Fermi-LAT sources are spatially coincident with galaxy mergers. Our findings establish galaxy mergers as a new class of HE $γ$-ray sources. Future neutrino and $γ$-ray observatories will be crucial to discover the particle acceleration mechanism in these newly identified CR sources.

### [45] [Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in Nuclear Star Clusters: A Combined Dynamical-Secular Channel for GW231123-like Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13820)
*Bin Liu,Dong Lai*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explains how high-mass binary black hole mergers like GW231123, with both BHs in the high-mass gap and high spins, can be formed through dynamical processes in nuclear star clusters via binary-single interactions and secular evolution influenced by a central supermassive BH. This mechanism predicts observable signatures like micro tidal disruption events and low-frequency gravitational waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW231123 challenges existing models as its components are in the high-mass gap, suggesting second-generation (2G) BHs. However, the formation mechanisms for such 2G binaries are poorly understood.

Method: The study models BH binary formation in Milky Way-like galaxy nuclear star clusters using binary-single interactions and secular evolution effects from a central supermassive BH. It simulates dynamic processes leading to 2G BH mergers.

Result: The model reproduces the merger rate consistent with GW231123 and predicts an abundance of 2G BH-star or low-mass BH binaries. These systems could produce detectable phenomena like micro tidal disruptions or low-frequency GWs.

Conclusion: Detection of the predicted binaries would validate dynamical assembly pathways for 2G BHs and offer insights into their hierarchical formation processes in dense stellar environments.

Abstract: The recent binary black hole (BH) merger GW231123, with both components likely in the high-mass gap and with high spins, challenges standard BH binary formation models. It is usually thought that the BHs are of second (or higher) generation (2G), resulting from the mergers of smaller BHs. But the physical processes that produce the merging 2G BH binaries are unclear and highly unconstrained. We show that such 2G mergers can be naturally produced in the nuclear star cluster of Milky Way-like galaxy. The dominant channel combines a sequence of binary-single interactions with secular evolution driven by the central supermassive BH. Our model produces a merger rate consistent with GW231123 and further predicts an abundant population of 2G BH-star (or low-mass BH) binaries; these binaries may observationally manifest as micro tidal disruption events or low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Detecting these binaries would provide crucial insights into the dynamical pathways of hierarchical BH assembly.

*Nora B. Linzer,Lucia Armillotta,Eve C. Ostriker,Eliot Quataert*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates traditional magnetic field estimates using cosmic ray transport models in TIGRESS simulations, showing equipartition works at kpc scales but fails at smaller scales, suggesting adjustments using constant CR density or observables like star formation rate. Synthetic emissions are used to map magnetic directions effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the validity of the traditional equipartition assumption for magnetic field strength estimates across different spatial scales in the local ISM and improve methods for magnetic field estimation using observable quantities.

Method: Used TIGRESS MHD simulations with CR transport models to generate synthetic synchrotron emission. Compared equipartition-based magnetic field estimates with simulation results across scales from kpc to ~10 pc. Tested assumptions of constant CR energy density and relations with star formation rate/gas weight.

Result: Traditional equipartition holds at kpc scales but fails at smaller scales. Improved estimates using constant CR density per observation and observable-derived CR energy density. Synthetic polarization maps successfully recover true magnetic field directions.

Conclusion: Traditional equipartition requires scale-dependent adjustments for accuracy. Combining scale-specific CR assumptions and observable quantities enhances magnetic field estimation. Synthetic polarization techniques effectively map field directions, supporting their use in observational studies.

Abstract: We use models of spectrally resolved cosmic ray (CR) transport in TIGRESS MHD simulations of the local ISM to produce synthetic synchrotron emission and to test, on scales from a few kpc down to ~10 pc, the traditional estimate of magnetic field strength based on the assumption of equipartition between the magnetic and total CR energy densities. Our analysis shows that the traditional equipartition estimate works well at the kpc scale of the simulation box, but breaks down at smaller scales. We find that the predicted magnetic field strength can be improved at small scales by assuming a constant CR energy density across each mock radio observation. The large-scale mean CR energy density can be estimated by assuming equipartition with the large-scale mean magnetic energy density, or as a function of additional observable quantities such as the star formation rate surface density or gas weight. In addition to estimating the magnetic field strength, we use synthetic polarized emission to create maps of the magnetic field direction. We find that the true magnetic field direction can be recovered well from the mock observations.

Abstract: Magnetars are the leading candidate sources of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars -- to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810$-$197 over 4.5 years and two decades in frequency (300 MHz to 6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in December 2018. We present detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810$-$197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810$-$197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant-pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of the detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases.

### [48] [The Scoured Spike: Suppression of Indirect Dark Matter Signals by a Hidden Companion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13858)
*Jaden Lopez,Stefano Profumo*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: A dark companion orbiting the Galactic Center's supermassive black hole can significantly reduce the dark matter annihilation signal by creating a low-density region. The effect's impact depends on spike slope, companion mass, and orbital parameters, with shallow density spikes seeing up to two orders of magnitude suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how intermediate-mass black holes or other dark companions influence dark matter density spikes around supermassive black holes, and the resulting impact on annihilation signal predictions for astroparticle searches.

Method: Combines an analytical scouring-radius model with numerical density profile integrations to compute J-factor suppression. Parameters explored include companion mass, orbital separation, system age, spike slope, and annihilation plateau interactions.

Result: For steep Gondolo-Silk spikes (γ≥2), J-factor reductions are mild. Shallow spikes (γ≤1.8) show strong suppression (1-2 orders of magnitude) even with small companions (~10^4 Msun at 100 AU orbits, Gyr timescales). A fitting formula accurately predicts results within ~10%.

Conclusion: Neglecting dark companions causes significant overestimation of Galactic Center J-factors, affecting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter interpretations of dark matter annihilation signals.

Abstract: A massive "dark companion"-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a "scoured" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $γ_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $γ_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.

*The KM3NeT Collaboration*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the possibility that the highest energy neutrino event detected by KM3NeT/ARCA originates from blazars. Using Astro-Multimessenger Modeling software, it finds that a population of blazars could explain both the observed neutrino flux and the gamma-ray flux measured by Fermi-LAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the origin of the ultra-high energy neutrino event (220 PeV) detected by KM3NeT and determine if blazars could be the source, reconciling the observed neutrino flux with gamma-ray measurements.

Method: The study uses the publicly available Astro-Multimessenger Modeling software to simulate blazar gamma-ray and neutrino emissions, comparing the resulting fluxes with the KM3NeT neutrino event and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data.

Result: A population of blazars is found capable of producing a diffuse neutrino flux compatible with the 220 PeV event while also aligning with the observed diffuse gamma-ray flux from Fermi-LAT.

Conclusion: Blazar populations are plausible sources for ultra-high energy neutrinos, as their predicted emissions match both neutrino and gamma-ray observational data.

Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration has reported the detection of the highest energy neutrino event observed to date. The energy of the event is of the order of 220 PeV hinting towards a neutrino flux at the highest energies. In this article, the potential blazar origin for this event is explored. The publicly available Astro-Multimessenger Modeling software is used to model the blazar gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes. It is concluded that a population of blazars could produce the diffuse flux compatible with the observation of the ultra-high energy event detected by the KM3NeT/ARCA detector. At the same time, the gamma-ray flux produced by such a population of blazars is consistent with the diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.

*Xin Xiang,Jon M. Miller,Ehud Behar,W. N. Brandt,Luigi Gallo,Doyee Byun,Elena Gallo*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of Mrk 877's UFOs reveals three components with velocities up to 0.10c, capable of significant AGN feedback. Their properties suggest a two-phase medium driven by radiative and magnetic forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of UFOs in AGN feedback mechanisms by analyzing their properties (velocity, ionization, density) in Mrk 877.

Method: Photoionization analysis of XMM-Newton data, identifying UFO components via absorption features in soft/hard X-ray bands. Used Absorption Measurement Distributions (AMD) to infer density profiles and momentum relations.

Result: Three UFO components with velocities 0.10c, 0.04c, and 0.05c detected, showing varied ionization and column densities. Fastest component exceeds 5% Eddington luminosity. Two-phase medium indicated by velocity overlap between low/high ionization components. Momentum trends imply combined radiative/magnetic driving.

Conclusion: UFOs in Mrk 877 effectively contribute to galaxy-scale feedback. Their dynamics and structure point to clumpy media influenced by both radiation and magnetic fields.

Abstract: Ultra Fast Outflows (UFOs) are powerful, highly ionized winds launched from the innermost regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), reaching velocities of 0.03 -- 0.3 c and playing a key role in AGN feedback. We present a photoionization analysis of an 18 ks \xmm\ snapshot of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 877, revealing three distinct UFO components with line-of-sight velocities of $0.10^{+0.005}_{-0.005}~c$ , $ 0.04^{+0.005}_{-0.004}~c$ , and $0.05^{+0.005}_{-0.004}~c$. These components span a broad range of ionization parameters and column densities, producing absorption features across both soft and hard X-ray bands. Even under the most conservative assumption for the volume filling factor, the fastest component exceeds $5\%$ of the Eddington luminosity, making it capable of driving strong galaxy-scale feedback. The soft X-ray UFO component, despite its lower ionization, shares a similar velocity as a higher-ionization component, hinting at a two-phase medium likely shaped by clumpiness or interactions with ambient material. The density profile inferred from the Absorption Measurement Distributions (AMD) and the positive trend between outflow momentum rate and radiation momentum flux suggest that wind is powered by a combination of radiative and magnetic driving.

### [51] [Delayed radio emission in tidal disruption events from collisions of outflows driven by disk instabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14008)
*Samantha C. Wu,Daichi Tsuna,Brenna Mockler,Anthony L. Piro*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores how delayed radio emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) is caused by collisions between mass outflows from accretion disks and the surrounding medium, producing synchrotron radiation that matches observed properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of delayed radio emission in TDEs linked to outflows from accretion disks and their interactions with the circumnuclear medium (CNM).

Method: Simulating collisions between successive disk outflows ('flares') and between outflows and CNM. Calculating resulting shock velocities, radio luminosities, and comparing with observed TDE radio data.

Result: Models reproduce observed radio emission luminosities (10²⁷–10³⁰ erg/s/Hz) and light curves, showing shock velocities 0.05c–0.3c. Variations in outflow mass, CNM density, and flare timing intervals explain peak timescales and fluxes.

Conclusion: Collisions from disk-instability-driven outflows are a viable mechanism for TDEs' delayed radio emission, aligning with observational data across multiple events.

Abstract: Delayed radio emission has been associated with a growing proportion of tidal disruption events (TDEs). For many events, the radio synchrotron emission is inferred to originate from the interaction of mildly-relativistic outflows, launched with delay times of $\sim 100$--$1000$ d after the TDE optical peak. The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows ("flares") from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_ν \sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events. We quantify how the typical peak timescale and flux varies for different properties of our models, and compare our model predictions to a selection of TDEs with delayed radio emission. Our models successfully reproduce the light curves and SEDs for several events, supporting the idea that delayed outflows from disk instabilities and state transitions can power late-time radio emission in TDEs.

Abstract: White dwarfs which explode by the double-detonation mechanism may have a binary white dwarf donor which is subsequently ignited by its collision with the ejecta. This results in the destruction of the donor via either the triple- or quadruple-detonation mechanism, adding significant mass to the resulting ejecta as well as modifying its structure and composition. We simulate the evolution of supernova remnants resulting from such detonations in a variety of binary progenitors and compare them against a double detonation with a surviving donor. Because of the time delay between the detonations of the two white dwarfs, high-velocity ejecta from the first explosion governs the first few centuries of remnant evolution, whereas at later times the dense core resulting from the donor detonation drives both the forward and reverse shocks to larger radii. The collision between the highest-velocity ejecta of the primary explosion and the donor carves a conical wake into the ejecta, which persists into the remnant phase regardless of whether or not the donor detonates. Our suite of simulated remnants are found to exhibit multiple distinguishing features of the explosion properties: a distinct X-ray morphology in the thermal emission and iron lines for triple detonations and smaller remnants with centrally-concentrated emission for double detonations. The remnants are also varied in their elemental abundances and distributions, particularly for lighter elements, but these have limited observational utility and are sensitive to the properties of the progenitor binary.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study confirms J0550-6823 as an Mg-rich SNR in the LMC, linking its low Ne/Mg ratio to an extended convective shell in the progenitor. This suggests up to 40% of LMC massive stars may have similar structures, impacting supernova models and galactic chemical evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of shell burning and internal mixing in massive stars by analyzing Mg-rich SNRs as indicators of pre-supernova convective structures.

Method: Reanalysis of X-ray data for J0550-6823 using spectral analysis to determine Ne/Mg ratios, followed by comparison with pre-supernova models.

Result: Confirmed low Ne/Mg ratio (~1) for J0550-6823, identifying it as Mg-rich. Estimated 2-3 Mg-rich SNRs in the LMC imply 10-40% of massive stars there had extended convective shells.

Conclusion: Extended convective shells in massive stars are significant for core-collapse supernova progenitors and influence galactic chemical evolution through element mixing.

Abstract: Shell burning and internal mixing in massive stars play an important role in setting the initial conditions for core-collapse supernova explosions. In the late stages of stellar evolution, intense shell burning can cause distinct convective regions to merge, fundamentally restructuring the stellar interior. Although such phenomena are difficult to observe directly, the observation of ``Mg-rich'' supernova remnants (SNRs) has recently emerged as a potential signature of these events. In this study, we reanalyze X-ray observations of J0550--6823, a SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a new candidate Mg-rich SNR. Our spectral analysis confirms a low Ne/Mg mass ratio of $\approx$1, and its classification as Mg-rich. By comparing the observational results with pre-supernova models, we suggest that the progenitor of J0550-6823 likely had an extended convective shell that reduces the Ne/Mg ratio prior to its explosion. Furthermore, we observe that $\sim$2--3 Mg-rich SNRs exist in the LMC, suggesting that $\lesssim$10--40\% of massive stars in the LMC may have had an extended convective shell, similar to what we observed in J0550-6823. This fraction would be important for understanding the final stages of the evolution of massive stars and galactic chemical evolution.

TL;DR: PSR J1951+2837 is a nearby pulsar with a period of 7.334 s and DM=2.9 pc/cm³, located 200-300 pc from Earth. Observed at 110 MHz (LPA) and 1250 MHz (FAST), it emits few bright pulses, allowing researchers to derive its timing solution at 110 MHz and identify it as one of the least luminous pulsars with a spectral index α=2.5-3.2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to characterize PSR J1951+2837's properties, especially its low luminosity and spectral behavior, by analyzing its rare bright pulse observations from two radio telescopes.

Method: Detected 343 pulses via LPA at 110 MHz and 5 via FAST at 1250 MHz. Calculated timing solution using TOAs of bright pulses. Derived spectral index from flux density measurements at both frequencies.

Result: The pulsar has an unusually low luminosity and spectral index α≈2.5-3.2, indicating steep spectrum emission. Only 343/5 pulses detected across observations suggest its rarity in emitting bright pulses.

Conclusion: PSR J1951+2837 represents an intriguing case of a low-luminosity pulsar, providing insights into extreme emission mechanisms and the pulsar population's diversity.

Abstract: PSR J1951+2837 is a nearby pulsar with a period of 7.334 s and dispersion measure of DM = 2.9 $\pm$ 0.6 pc cm$^{-3}$, located about 200 or 300 pc from the Sun. It occasionally radiates bright pulses and has been observed by the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope at 110 MHz and by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) at 1250 MHz. We detected only 343 pulses in 228 LPA observation sessions and 5 bright pulses in two FAST sessions. Based on the times of arrival (TOAs) of these bright pulses, we determined the coherent timing solution for this pulsar at a frequency of 110 MHz. Based on flux densities (S) of these bright pulses at two frequencies ($ν$), we found that it is probably one of the known pulsars with the lowest luminosities to date, with a spectral index of about $α$ = (2.5 - 3.2) for S $\sim ν^{-α}$.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates if quarkyonic equations of state (EOS) can explain compact objects with masses between 2.5–4.5 solar masses observed in the GW230529 gravitational-wave event. It finds that quarkyonic EOS models allow stable configurations in this mass range, suggesting such stars could fill the mass gap, potentially identifying the heavier GW230529 object as a massive quarkyonic neutron star instead of a black hole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if quarkyonic matter can account for compact objects in the proposed mass gap (2.5–4.5 M☉) observed in GW230529, challenging the traditional neutron star-black hole dichotomy.

Method: Analyzing pressure-energy density and mass-radius relations from quarkyonic EOS models, focusing on high-density stiffening and resulting stable configurations.

Result: The models show M-R sequences extending into the 2.5–4.5 M☉ mass window with radii ~13-15 km, supporting quarkyonic stars as plausible explanations for objects in the mass gap.

Conclusion: Quarkyonic neutron stars could naturally occupy the mass gap, suggesting the heavier GW230529 object might not be a black hole but a massive neutron star under this EOS framework.

Abstract: We examine whether quarkyonic equations of state (EOS) can account for compact objects in the $2.5$-$4.5\,M_\odot$ mass range reported for the GW230529 gravitational-wave event. The pressure-energy density and mass-radius (M-R) relations obtained from quarkyonic EOS models indicate a significant stiffening at high densities, allowing stable configurations beyond $2.5\,M_\odot$. The predicted M-R sequences extend into the GW230529 mass window while maintaining radii in the range of $\approx 13$-$15$~km, suggesting that quarkyonic stars can naturally populate the so-called compact object mass gap. These results imply that the heavier component of GW230529 could plausibly be a massive quarkyonic neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the orbital variability of optical spectra in V379 Vir, a magnetic cataclysmic variable with a brown dwarf donor, despite prior studies lacking such detailed spectral analysis.

Method: Spectroscopic observations using a 6-m telescope to analyze Hα emission variability and Zeeman splitting in hydrogen lines for magnetic field assessment.

Result: Hα formation site identified as accretion stream near L1, and white dwarf's magnetic field shows complexity beyond a simple dipole configuration.

Conclusion: Revises previous assumptions about emission origins and highlights the need for models accounting for complex magnetic fields in similar systems.

Abstract: The polar V379 Vir is a well-known magnetic cataclysmic variable with a brown dwarf donor. Despite numerous studies of this system across various spectral ranges, a detailed investigation of the orbital variability of its optical spectra has not been carried out. In this work, we present an analysis of spectroscopic observations of V379 Vir obtained with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The orbital variability of the H$α$ emission indicates that the line is most likely formed in the accretion stream near the Lagrangian point L$_1$, rather than on the donor's surface as previously assumed. The analysis of the rotational variability of the Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines reveals a complex magnetic field topology of the white dwarf, which differs from a simple dipole configuration.

TL;DR: The analysis of RX J0520.5-6932's 2024 outburst reveals variable pulse profiles, spectral features, and a declining spin-up rate, indicating changing accretion geometry and torque with accretion rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the energy/luminosity dependence of pulsed emission, spin evolution, and broadband X-ray spectral properties during the outburst after a decade of quiescence.

Method: X-ray monitoring using NICER and AstroSat/LAXPC near the outburst peak; analysis of light curves, pulse profiles, and broadband spectra.

Result: Short flares (~400-700s), energy-dependent pulse形态 changes, soft excess, emission features at ~1 keV, and a declining spin-up rate due to reduced mass accretion.

Conclusion: The observed variations in pulse shape, spin behavior, and spectra reflect rapid changes in accretion geometry and torque linked to accretion rate dynamics.

Abstract: After nearly a decade of quiescence, the transient Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0520.5-6932 underwent an outburst in 2024. We performed X-ray monitoring of the source with NICER and AstroSat near the peak of the event. Our primary objective is to investigate the energy and luminosity dependence of the pulsed emission, characterize the spin evolution, and study the broadband X-ray spectral properties of RX J0520.5-6932 during the outburst. The AstroSat/LAXPC and NICER light curves reveal pronounced short-duration flaring activity lasting ~400-700 s, with enhancements by a factor of ~2. The pulse profile exhibits a strong dependence on both energy and intensity, evolving from a simple single-peaked structure at low energies to complex multi-peaked shapes at intermediate energies, and reverting to simpler morphologies at higher energies. Pulse profiles during the flares differ significantly from those in the persistent state, indicating changes in the pulsed beam pattern with a change in the intensity on a short timescale. Broadband spectral analysis reveals a soft excess and an emission feature at ~1 keV, likely arising from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc and fluorescence from Ne K and Fe L ions. Continuous NICER monitoring over nearly one orbital cycle enabled us to track spin evolution with accretion-driven spin-up and spectral variability in the soft X-ray band. Additionally, a declining spin-up rate is observed during the outburst, likely due to a gradual reduction in mass accretion rate. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the complex accretion dynamics in RX J0520.5-6932 during its 2024 outburst.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper describes experiments creating strongly photoionized argon plasmas using X-ray L-shell emission from silver foils irradiated by a high-power laser. It compares experimental Ar K-β spectra with Cloudy code simulations, showing that astrophysical codes can model laboratory plasmas but require precise measurement of the X-ray drive spectrum.

Motivation: To replicate extreme photoionization conditions found in astrophysical accretion sources in the laboratory, and validate astrophysical modeling codes (like Cloudy) for laboratory plasma studies.

Method: Argon plasmas were generated using X-ray L-shell emission from Ag foils irradiated by the VULCAN laser. Experimental K-β X-ray spectra were compared with time-dependent Cloudy code simulations.

Result: The experiments showed that photoionization effects from sub-keV photons significantly impact outer-shell electron behavior and that accurate modeling requires detailed X-ray spectrum measurements across all energies.

Conclusion: Astrophysical codes like Cloudy can successfully model laboratory photoionized plasmas, emphasizing the necessity of precise X-ray spectral measurements for accurate simulations.

Abstract: We have generated strongly photoionized Ar plasmas in experiments designed to use primarily X-ray L-shell line emission generated from Ag foils irradiated by the VULCAN high-power laser at the UK Central Laser Facility. The principle of the experiment is that use of line emission rather than the usual sub-keV quasi-blackbody source allows keV radiation to play a more dominant role compared to softer X-rays and thus mimic the effect of a blackbody with a higher effective spectral temperature. Our aim is to reproduce in the laboratory the extreme photoionization conditions found in accretion-powered astrophysical sources. In this paper, we compare the experimental results on K-$β$ X-ray Ar spectra with modelling using the time-dependent version of the Cloudy astrophysical code. The results indicate that photoionized laboratory plasmas can be successfully modelled with codes such as Cloudy that have been developed for application to astrophysical sources. Our comparison of simulation and experiment shows that the flux of sub-keV photons that photoionize the outer-shell electrons can have a significant effect, and that detailed measurements of the X-ray drive spectrum across all photon energy ranges are crucial for accurate modelling of experiments.

Abstract: I identify a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant SNR G11.2-0.3 composed of three pairs of opposite morphological features, and attribute their shaping to three energetic pairs of jets during the explosion process in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The pairs of morphological features are two opposite rings, a strip of dense ejecta extending on both sides of the central pulsar PSR J1811-1925, and an ear-nozzle opposite structure. According to the JJEM, additional weaker pairs of jets may also have participated in the explosion. The jets' axis from the ear to the nozzle coincides with the axis of the presently active pulsar jets, which is the pulsar spin axis. The jets of this pair were the last that the newly born neutron star launched during the explosion, and the accretion disk that launched these jets spun up the neutron star in the same direction as the jets. The identification of a point-symmetric morphology in SNR G11.2-0.3 strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.
