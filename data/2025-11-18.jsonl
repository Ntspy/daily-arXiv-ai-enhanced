This map is expressed in terms of an enhancement function of the eccentricity, which is appropriately resummed to ensure accuracy for any eccentricity; in particular, I recover known results for circular orbits. In order to obtain this map, the local dynamics are expressed using an action-angle formulation. The tail term is treated as a perturbation, which is first localized in time, then Delaunay-averaged. Both operations require a contact transformation of the phase-space variables, which I explicitly control. Using the first law of binary black hole mechanics, I then obtain the orbit-averaged redshift invariant for eccentric orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order; when properly accounting for the tail contributions, it perfectly agrees with analytical self-force at postgeodesic order [arXiv:2203.13832]. Finally, I use these results to re-express the fluxes of energy and angular momentum obtained at third post-Newtonian order in [arXiv:0711.0302] and [arXiv:0908.3854] in terms of fundamental frequencies."}

In this article, we study the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation as a starting point to understand the phenomenology of linearised classical-quantum hybrid gravity. In particular, we describe how to compute the non-equilibrium two point function of the scalar field, showing explicitly the role of the initial state in regulating divergences. To do so, we use a \"mod-squared-retarded\" pole-prescription and find that the covariance in the field is non-zero only outside the lightcone, scales inversely with the spatial distance of the spacetime points and grows linearly in time. The energy has a contact divergence similar to that found in the quantum case. We conclude by discussing possible implications of anomalous diffusion for hybrid theories of gravity, especially looking at the energy density in the predicted gravitational waves background, which can be inferred from the scalar covariances."}

In this paper we provide comprehensive mathematical and phenomenological evidence that deepens and refines this primary model. The symmetry of the 24-cell yields a unified hypercharge functional that reproduces Standard Model hypercharge assignments while ensuring anomaly cancellation. By projecting the vertices of the 24-cell onto a three-dimensional flavor subspace using a Minimal Distortion Principle, an emergent tetrahedral structure appears that gives rise to an effective $A_4$ symmetry in the neutrino sector. Extending this discrete symmetry to its binary double cover $T^\\prime$ provides the spinorial representations and intrinsic complex phases needed to generate realistic quark Yukawa textures. Guided by the tenet that spacetime and matter are inextricably linked, our analysis suggests that the intricate flavor mixing of the Standard Model may be a residual imprint of the underlying quantum-geometric nature of spacetime."}

Goltsev"], "title": "CPT symmetry in the mirror universe", "comment": "8 pages", "summary": "A model of a two-sheeted universe in the quantum theory of gravity is proposed, based on the definition of 3D invariant and gauge-invariant proper time of the universe. A uniform time in a closed universe is introduced in the class of equivalent reference systems defined by the spectrum of a Hermitian 3D operator on the space of Dirac bi-spinors, the equality to zero of which is equivalent to a system of gravitational constraints. Based on the analogy with the Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory in Minkowski space and the definition of discrete C-, P- and T-transformations separately, the principle of CPT symmetry in a two-sheeted universe is formulated. A covariant quantum theory of matter gauge fields consistent with the charge conjugation operation in a two-sheeted universe is proposed. The CPT symmetric state of a homogeneous isotropic two-sheeted model of the universe is constructed by an iterative method in which the no-boundary Hartle--Hawking wave function is used as a zeroth approximation."}

The presence of vacuum-like jets, jets that experienced little interaction with the Quark Gluon Plasma, in the nucleus-nucleus samples dilutes the overall observed modification hindering the detailed study of the underlying physical mechanisms. The ability to ascertain on a jet-by-jet basis the degree of modification of a jet would be an invaluable step in overcoming this limitation. We consider a Transformer classifier, trained on a low-level representation of jets given by the 4-momenta of all its constituents. We show that the Transformer is able to capture discriminating information not accessible to other architectures which use high-level physical observables as input. The Transformer allows us to identify, in the experimentally relevant case where both medium response and underlying event contamination are accounted for, a class of jets that have been unequivocally modified. Further, we perform a robust estimate of the upper bound for the fraction of jets in nucleus-nucleus collisions that are, for all purposes, indistinguishable from those produced in proton-proton collisions."}

We investigate dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles, including spin-dependent interactions, for direct detection experiments and demonstrate that, although the scattering rate generally depends on multiple types of material response functions, certain linear combinations of these material response functions vanish if the initial and final electronic states share the same Hamiltonian. We also find that several other response functions vanish in parity-symmetric materials, making these systems as simple as isotropic detectors in some respects. Finally, we present the scattering rate for an anisotropic, possibly chiral detector, for generic dark matter-electron spin interactions. These relations reduce the number of independent response functions needed, thereby simplifying the computational complexity for a broad class of dark matter models. Our results provide a complete and efficient toolkit for analyzing electron recoil signals in diverse detector materials."}
