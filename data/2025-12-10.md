Abstract: Context. The origin of the astrophysical high-energy neutrino flux remains uncertain. Core-collapse supernovae with strong CSM interaction (Type IIn) are compelling candidates for efficient hadronic acceleration and neutrino production. Aims. We investigate the possible association between the Type IIn supernova SN2025cbj and the IceCube high-energy neutrino IceCube-250421A, and assess whether the observed properties of the SN permit an appreciable neutrino yield. Methods. We combined rapid optical follow-up with LAST and archival ZTF photometry with spectroscopy from LT/SPRAT and MMT/BINOSPEC to characterize the SN evolution and CSM interaction. We estimated the explosion and peak times from early light-curve fitting, and quantified the chance-coincidence probability with resampling simulations that scramble neutrino right ascensions while preserving declinations and error contours. Using a simple post-shock-breakout interaction model in a dense wind, we estimated the expected muon-neutrino yield for IceCube real-time Bronze stream. Results. Spectra of SN2025cbj obtained after the neutrino epoch show persistent narrow Balmer lines superposed on broad Lorentzian electron-scattering wings, consistent with sustained dense-CSM interaction. For the multi-messenger association, resampling simulations against the TNS catalog give a chance-coincidence probability for observing $k \ge 1$ events of $p \simeq 0.24$ (and $p \simeq 0.078$ against the ZTF-BTS catalog). These values are sensitive to the size of the SNe and neutrino samples. A post-breakout interaction scenario predicts an expected $N_{ν_μ} \sim 10^{-3}$ events in the IceCube Bronze alert stream over 76 days per this one candidate. We discuss the implications of these numbers and possible biases that may affect these results.

Abstract: Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to several PeV energies, but this has yet to be confirmed as general behavior. Although several sources show ~100 TeV gamma rays, their hadronic origin is uncertain; a matching neutrino signal would provide definitive evidence. Using insight from the theory of diffusive shock acceleration, we evaluate the spectra and environments of the sample of Galactic SNRs to identify those most likely to be hadronic, categorizing them into a tiered catalog depending on their likelihood to produce neutrinos detectable in the TeV-PeV range. We then calculate the estimated stacked sensitivity of IceCube for each tier using IceCube's ten-year public data. Our results suggest that this strategy of stacking SNRs and carefully excluding leptonic sources by using theoretical arguments may allow for a detection of this source class that would otherwise be impossible. A follow-up analysis of these catalogs using TeV-PeV sensitive neutrino data from IceCube (or similar telescopes like KM3NeT/ARCA) offers the most decisive, near-future test for the hadronic nature of these SNRs and the maximum energies of their CR spectra.

### [3] [UVOIR spectrum, X-ray emission, and proper motion of the isolated neutron star RX J2143.0+0654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08033)
*George G. Pavlov,Vadim Abramkin,B. Posselt*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of isolated neutron star RX J2143.0+0654 using Hubble Space Telescope data reveals a two-component thermal spectrum, a small apparent size (dependent on distance), possible surrounding extended emission, and a low proper motion indicating a recent origin near the solar system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the emission properties, distance, kinematics, and origin of the isolated neutron star RX J2143.0+0654 through multi-wavelength observations.

Method: Analysis of HST UVOIR spectra combined with X-ray data using a two-component blackbody model plus power-law fit, proper motion calculation from 14-year baseline HST imaging, and comparison with historical observations.

Result: Detected UV/NIR-optical spectral behaviors, derived temperatures/ radii for two thermal components, identified an absorption feature, measured proper motion (6 mas/yr), and found extended NIR emission (~2'' size). Parameters match previous X-ray results.

Conclusion: The neutron star's properties support a origin near the solar system ~0.5 million years ago with low transverse velocity, possibly indicating a birth in the local interstellar medium.

Abstract: We observed the isolated neutron star RX J2143.0+0654 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the UVOIR wavelength range (0.14-1.7 $μ$m). The UV part is consistent with a Rayleigh-Jeans tail of a thermal spectrum, $f_ν\propto ν^2$, while a power-law spectrum, $f_ν\propto ν^α$ with $α\sim -0.8$, dominates in the NIR-optical. A joint fit of the UVOIR and contemporaneous X-ray spectra with a two-component blackbody with possible absorption features + power-law optical spectrum yields the following temperature and apparent radius of the colder component (which gives the main contribution in the UV): $kT_{\rm cold}\approx 45$ eV, $R_{\rm cold}\approx 6 d_{260}$ km, where $d_{260}$ is the distance in units of 260 pc. The temperature and radius of the hotter component, $kT_{\rm hot}\approx 106$ eV and $R_{\rm hot} \approx 1.5d_{260}$ km, the parameters of an absorption feature at 0.74 keV, and the properties of X-ray pulsations, are the same as found in previous X-ray observations. In the NIR images the neutron star is possibly surrounded by extended emission with a characteristic size of $\sim 2''$ and flux densities of about 1.7 and 0.9 $μ$Jy at 1.54 and 1.15 $μ$m, respectively. Comparison with a previous HST observation in the optical 14 years ago shows a proper motion $μ\approx 6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a small transverse velocity of $7d_{260}$ km s$^{-1}$. It is consistent with the hypothesis that the neutron star was born in the vicinity of the solar system about 0.5 Myr ago.

### [4] [First detection of X-ray polarization from the long-period X-ray pulsar 4U 1954+319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08195)
*Alexander Salganik,Lingda Kong,Sofia V. Forsblom,Menglei Zhou,Honghui Liu,Sergey S. Tsygankov,Andrea Santangelo,Juri Poutanen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The first detection of X-ray polarization in the slowly rotating X-ray pulsar 4U 1954+319 using IXPE reveals a polarization degree of 10.3% at pulse maximum and a polarization angle rotation of ~140°, supporting a geometric model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study X-ray polarization in an exotic binary system with a slowly rotating neutron star and red supergiant companion, providing insights into accretion processes and magnetic field geometry.

Method: Phase-resolved analysis of IXPE data, rotating vector model to explain PA variation, and derotation of Stokes parameters to recover phase-averaged polarization.

Result: No significant phase-averaged polarization (MDP99=5.0%) but significant polarization (10.3±3.1% at pulse max) and 140° PA rotation detected in phase-resolved analysis; 5.2σ detection after data derotation.

Conclusion: Observed features confirm the neutron star's geometric configuration and imply structured accretion flows modulated by magnetic field orientation.

Abstract: We report the first detection of X-ray polarization with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) from the X-ray pulsar (XRP) 4U 1954+319. The source belongs to an extremely rare class of systems in which a slowly rotating neutron star accretes from the dense wind of a red supergiant companion. Coherent pulsations are detected at $P_{\rm spin}=5.49\pm0.05$ h, which is one of the longest spin periods known among XRPs. While the phase-averaged analysis shows no significant polarization, with a 99% confidence minimum detectable polarization (MDP$_{99}$) of 5.0% in the 2-8 keV band, the phase-resolved analysis shows one interval at pulse maximum in which the polarization degree (PD) exceeds its MDP$_{99}$, giving ${\rm PD}=10.3\pm3.1$%. The polarization angle (PA) exhibits a smooth $\approx140^{\circ}$ rotation over the pulse, and a joint evaluation of all phase bins yields an overall detection significance of $3.3σ$. Using the rotating vector model, we identify the geometric solution that reproduces the observed PA variation. By subsequently applying an event-by-event derotation of the Stokes parameters based on this solution, we remove the PA swing and recover the phase-averaged polarization which is detected at the $5.2σ$ level.

Abstract: We present new two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supernova shock breakout from red supergiants using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code. Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, which are much dimmer and longer than those from blue supergiants. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \sim 1.69\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\sim}$10-30\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\odot}$ model with $E \sim 1.09\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse.

### [6] [The Head-on Collision of a Neutron Star with a White Dwarf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08231)
*Zong-kai Peng,He Gao,Xian-Fei Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates NS-WD collision outcomes, finding they can trigger thermonuclear explosions (leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia SNe) or form TZlO objects depending on WD type/mass and viscous drag conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if NS-WD collisions can ignite thermonuclear explosions in WDs or result in TZlO formation, exploring their astrophysical implications.

Method: Computed physical processes of head-on NS-WD collisions for different WD types (He, CO, ONe). Analyzed two key conditions for explosion ignition and criteria for TZlO formation considering viscous drag effects.

Result: Thermonuclear explosions possible in certain WD mass/radius regimes meeting temperature & degeneracy conditions. TZlOs form in low-mass CO/ONe WDs with sufficient viscosity to retain NS without explosion.

Conclusion: NS-WD collisions offer a viable pathway for both sub-Chandrasekhar SNe Ia and TZlO creation, expanding our understanding of compact object interactions and explosion mechanisms.

Abstract: We have computed the physical processes involved in a head-on collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD). The outcomes of such collisions vary depending on the mass and type of the WD. We have separately examined the dynamical processes for collisions between NSs and helium WDs (He-WDs), carbon-oxygen WDs (CO-WDs), and oxygen-neon WDs (ONe-WDs). We aim to investigate whether the collision can trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD, and if not, whether the NS can remain bound within the WD to form a Thorne-Zytkow-like object (TZlO). For a thermonuclear explosion to occur, at least two conditions must be satisfied: (i) the collision-induced temperature must reach the ignition threshold of the relevant nuclear reactions, and (ii) the burning material must remain in a degenerate state. For different types of WDs, there exist parameter ranges where both conditions are fulfilled, implying that NS-WD collisions can indeed induce thermonuclear explosions, leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae or other exotic optical transients powered by thermonuclear explosion. On the other hand, the formation of a TZlO requires that the WD material exerts sufficient drag on the NS to prevent its escape, while the interaction must not trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD. Our results indicate that such conditions can be realized in the case of low-mass CO-WDs and low-mass ONe-WDs, provided that the viscous coefficient is sufficiently large.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio pulses. Their origin is still unknown in the field of astronomy. A notable distinction among FRBs is that some sources repeat, while others appear to be non-repeating events. Interestingly, repeating FRBs tend to exhibit broader temporal widths and narrower spectral bandwidths compared to non-repeat events, suggesting they may arise from different physical mechanisms. However, current radio telescopes have limited coverage and sensitivity, which hinders a complete survey with continuous long-term monitoring. This issue makes it difficult to confirm repeat activity and potentially leads to misclassification of repeaters as non- repeaters; these are referred to as repeater candidates. To address this, machine learning techniques have emerged as a useful tool for classifying distinct FRB types in previous studies. In this study, we utilize the CHIME/FRB baseband catalog with three orders of magnitude better time resolution than the intensity catalog. Measured fluences are available in the baseband catalog, while only upper limits are reported in the intensity catalog. We apply machine learning to the baseband catalog to evaluate classification outcomes. We identify 15 repeater candidates among 122 non-repeating FRBs in the baseband catalog. Additionally, our classification identifies 31 sources previously categorized as repeater candidates as non-repeaters, highlighting a significant difference from the prior work. Of these repeater candidates, 14 overlap with previous findings, while 1 is newly identified in this work. Notably, one of our candidates was confirmed as a repeater by CHIME/FRB. Follow-up observations for the 14 candidates are highly encouraged.

Abstract: Recoiling remnants of black-hole mergers in dense environments can produce bright electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to the gravitational-wave (GW) emission. Significance assessments of such GW-EM candidates are restricted to time and sky-localisation consistency, omitting the physics governing the EM emission process. Different emission mechanisms, however, impose different observability constraints on the remnant black-hole recoil and spin, which are gravitational-wave observables. We present a statistical framework that includes such parameters. We assess the consistency of the GW190521-ZTF19abanrhr pair with two types of emission processes: a Blandford-Znajek jet closely aligned with the final spin axis and a diffusive isotropic flare. Assuming the sky-location of ZTF19abanrhr, we find these mechanisms to be respectively strongly and moderately disfavoured with log-evidences $\log_{10}{\cal I}_{\rm jet} = -1.65$ and $\log_{10}{\cal I}_{\rm diff} = -0.075$. Combining these with odds for a common sky-location $Ω$ we obtain respective combined odds $\log_{10} {\cal O}_{Ω,{\rm jet}}= -1.17$ and $\log_{10} {\cal O}_{Ω,{\rm diff}}= +0.39$ for a true GW-EM coincidence as opposed to a random one. Our method leverages a previously unexplored evidence axis to assess GW-EM associations and constrain both the physics powering flare mechanisms and the properties of AGNs.

*Kevin Park,Zoltan Haiman,Chengcheng Xin,Tzuken Shen,Ashley Villar,Jordy Davelaar*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The authors evaluate methods to detect gravitational self-lensing flares from supermassive black hole binaries using LSST data, finding that matched filters outperform Lomb-Scargle periodograms in distinguishing signal from noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective detection methods for identifying sub-parsec SMBHBs via their gravitational self-lensing flares in LSST quasar data, given the expected tens of millions of quasars and thousands of potential binary candidates.

Method: They tested Lomb-Scargle periodograms and matched filters on synthetic light curves combining self-lensing flares and DRW noise. SLFs were injected into DRW realizations, and both methods' performance was compared. A three-step matched filter procedure was developed for parameter recovery.

Result: Lomb-Scargle periodograms couldn't reliably distinguish SLF+DRW from DRW-only due to similar peak heights. Matched filters successfully detected SLFs even with LSST-like cadence, and the three-step method accurately recovered binary parameters.

Conclusion: Matched filters are a computationally feasible and effective method for detecting SMBHBs via SLFs in LSST's massive quasar dataset, enabling large-scale searches across millions of light curves.

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has now seen first light, and over a 10 year duration, LSST is projected to catalogue tens of millions of quasars, many of which are expected to be associated with sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Out of these SMBHBs, up to thousands of relatively massive binary-quasars are expected to exhibit gravitational self-lensing flares (SLFs) that last for at least 20-30 days. We assess the effectiveness of the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram and matched filters (MFs) as methods for systematic searches for these binaries, using toy-models of hydrodynamical, Doppler, and self-lensing variability from equal-mass, eccentric SMBHBs. We inject SLFs into random realizations of damped random walk (DRW) lightcurves, representing stochastic quasar variability, and compute the LS periodogram with and without the SLF. We find that periodograms of SLF+DRW light-curves do not have maximum peak heights that could not arise from DRW-only periodograms. On the other hand, the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can distinguish SLFs from noise even with LSST-like cadences and DRW noise. Furthermore, we develop a three-step procedure with matched filters, which can also recover injected binary parameters from these light-curves. We expect this method to be computationally efficient enough to be applicable to millions of quasar light-curves in LSST.

### [10] [Photon Dynamics and Collision Risks in Relativistic Spaceflight: A Comparative Study of Methods and Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08447)
*Li Kai Wen,Joao Rodrigues*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The dissertation examines the risks of relativistic spaceflight, including collisions with interstellar particles and photon interactions with the cosmic microwave background. It analyzes energy transfer via relativistic mechanics, discusses the Schwinger limit and photon-induced pair production, and evaluates thermal management strategies for spacecraft design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address the physical challenges of achieving viable relativistic spaceflight, particularly collisions and photon interactions at near-light speeds.

Method: Uses relativistic mechanics and energy conservation calculations to assess collision energy transfers, analyzes CMB blue-shifting effects, and applies Schwinger limit theory to photon-induced pair production scenarios.

Result: Found that even tiny particles pose significant collision risks due to extreme relativistic energy transfers, highlighted CMB radiation's thermal challenges via Doppler shift effects, and established limits for electromagnetic fields in spacecraft design.

Conclusion: Relativistic spacecraft must prioritize shielding against particle collisions, implement advanced thermal regulation systems, and adhere to electromagnetic field constraints to safely navigate relativistic interstellar travel.

Abstract: This dissertation explores the dynamics of relativistic spaceflight, focusing on the risks associated with collisions and photon interactions as a spacecraft approaches velocities near the speed of light. The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight.

### [11] [Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM III. Birth of an ultrafast outflow during a soft flare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08448)
*Liyi Gu,Keigo Fukumura,Jelle Kaastra,Megan Eckart,Ralf Ballhausen,Ehud Behar,Camille Diez,Matteo Guainazzi,Timothy Kallman,Erin Kara,Chen Li,Missagh Mehdipour,Misaki Mizumoto,Shoji Ogawa,Christos Panagiotou,Matilde Signorini,Atsushi Tanimoto,Keqin Zhao,Hirofumi Noda,Jon Miller,Satoshi Yamada*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The 2024 observation of NGC 3783 using XRISM detected an ultrafast outflow (UFO) moving at 0.19c, coinciding with a rapid soft X-ray/UV flare decay. The outflow's kinematic evolution, including velocity increases from 0.05c to 0.3c over three days, suggests magnetic driving mechanisms similar to solar coronal mass ejections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the connection between UFOs and accretion disk flares, exploring mechanisms like radiation vs. magnetic driving, and understanding outflow acceleration in active galactic nuclei.

Method: Analyzed XRISM Resolve X-ray data and UV observations of NGC 3783, tracking UFO signatures during a soft flare's rise, peak, and decay phases. Used statistical analysis to rule out chance detection and studied line broadening/velocity changes.

Result: Confirmed a 0.19c UFO linked to a <0.5-day flare decay with 99.9998% confidence. Observed velocity evolution from 0.05c to 0.3c over three days, with clumpy structure and insufficient radiation pressure for acceleration. Found similarities to solar coronal mass ejection dynamics.

Conclusion: Magnetic driving, possibly involving accretion disk reconnection, is proposed as the mechanism for both the UFO launch and flare. This challenges radiation-pressure models and highlights magnetic processes' role in AGN outflows.

Abstract: The 2024 X-ray/UV observation campaign of NGC 3783, led by XRISM, revealed the launch of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a radial velocity of 0.19c (57000 km/s). This event is synchronized with the sharp decay, within less than half a day, of a prominent soft X-ray/UV flare. Accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the XRISM Resolve data alone indicate a low probability of 2e-5 that this UFO detection is due to random chance. The UFO features narrow H-like and He-like Fe lines with a velocity dispersion of 1000 km/s, suggesting that it originates from a dense clump. Beyond this primary detection, there are hints of weaker outflow signatures throughout the rise and fall phases of the soft flare. Their velocities increase from 0.05c to 0.3c over approximately three days, and they may be associated with a larger stream in which the clump is embedded. The radiation pressure is insuffcient to drive the acceleration of this rapidly evolving outflow. The observed evolution of the outflow kinematics instead closely resembles that of solar coronal mass ejections, implying magnetic driving and, conceivably, reconnection near the accretion disk as the likely mechanisms behind both the UFO launch and the associated soft flare.

Abstract: Compact binary mergers and the collapse of massive stars can produce intense transients observable across high-energy wavelengths. Events such as gamma-ray bursts and kilonova emissions are often accompanied by gravitational wave detections, making them crucial sources for multimessenger astrophysics. To explore these phenomena theoretically, state-of-the-art approaches of General Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations are used. We present recent findings from our simulations, and discuss observational consequences of the stellar/post-merger environment on the gamma ray burst prompt emission properties.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Radiation-pressure instability in accretion disks explains luminosity oscillations, chaotic behavior, and state transitions across black holes and neutron stars, with implications for AGN activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of radiation-pressure instability on accretion disk dynamics and observational signatures in X-ray binaries and AGN, particularly at high luminosities near the Eddington limit.

Method: Analyzes theoretical models of radiation-pressure dominated accretion disks and compares them with observational data from stellar-mass black holes (heartbeat states, chaotic light curves) and AGN (duty cycles, spectral transitions).

Result: Confirmed radiation-pressure instability drives observed variability in stellar-mass black holes and provides plausible explanations for AGN phenomena like short-lived radio-loud phases and spectral-state changes. Neutron stars add complexity through boundary layer interactions.

Conclusion: Radiation-pressure instability is a unifying mechanism for accretion disk variability across compact objects, requiring further observational and theoretical exploration to fully explain neutron star differences and AGN scaling.

Abstract: Radiation-pressure instability was identified soon after the seminal classical accretion disk models of Shakura-Sunyaev and Novikov-Thorne, yet its full implications remain an active area of investigation. These models form the backbone of our understanding of accretion onto compact objects and successfully describe the phenomenology of black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries, as well as luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN), in the regime of high mass accretion rates. At luminosities approaching a significant fraction of the Eddington limit (L/LEdd > 0.1), standard thin disks are predicted to become thermally unstable due to the dominance of radiation pressure. This prediction has found empirical support in several Galactic stellar-mass black hole systems, where the instability manifests as quasi-periodic, large-amplitude luminosity oscillations, so-called "heartbeat states", and has been proposed as a driver of observed signatures of deterministic chaos in accretion-driven light curves. The scope of radiation-pressure-induced variability extends beyond stellar-mass black holes: both black holes across mass scales and accreting neutron stars can exhibit related behavior, though the presence of a boundary layer in neutron stars adds complexity and offers a unique laboratory for testing the interplay between accretion dynamics and the central object. On extragalactic scales, the instability has been invoked to explain the duty cycles and apparent short lifetimes of radio-loud AGN, as well as the dramatic spectral-state transitions seen in Changing-Look AGN.

### [14] [NICER Perspective on TeV Blazar Mrk~421: X-ray Variability and Particle Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08531)
*Sangeetha Kizhakkekalam,Gopal Bhatta,Navaneeth P K,Tek P. Adhikari*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of Mrk~421 using NICER X-ray data reveals extreme X-ray variability (28-fold flux increase) over two years. Spectral models favor a log-parabola, with a 'harder-when-brighter' trend. Significant correlations between spectral parameters and flux suggest energy-dependent particle acceleration mechanisms in blazar jets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate Mrk~421's X-ray variability and spectral properties over short and long timescales, and understand acceleration processes in relativistic jets through NICER's high sensitivity observations.

Method: Analyzed 45 NICER X-ray observations (2022-2024) with power-law, broken power-law, and log-parabola spectral models. Performed hardness ratio analysis and correlation studies between spectral parameters (Γ, α, β, E_p) and flux.

Result: Observed flux variation from ~50 to ~1380 counts/s, confirming a harder-when-brighter trend. Log-parabola model best fit spectral data. Correlated α with β positively, β negatively with E_p, and E_p positively with flux.

Conclusion: NICER data highlights the importance of multiwavelength studies for unpicking jet dynamics. Results support particle acceleration theories in turbulent, magnetized blazar jets, motivating further coordinated campaigns.

Abstract: Mrk~421 is one of the most fascinating blazars, widely studied across the electromagnetic spectrum using observations at various wavebands, from radio to the TeV gamma ray bands. We present the first detailed spectral and timing analysis of the TeV blazar Mrk~421 based on 45 X-ray observations from the \textit{NICER} X-ray telescope, collected over two years from 2022 to 2024. The source exhibits strong X-ray variability across intraday and long-term timescales. During this period, we observe a dramatic change in flux, from $\sim 50$ to $\sim 1380$~counts~s$^{-1}$, representing a $\sim 28$-fold increase. Spectral modeling with power-law, broken power-law, and log-parabolic functions shows that the log-parabola provides the most accurate description of the X-ray spectra. The hardness ratio analysis confirms a \textit{harder-when-brighter} trend, consistent with the anticorrelation between flux and both $Γ$ and $α$. Correlation studies reveal a positive relation between $α$ and $β$, a negative correlation between $β$ and synchrotron peak energy $E_{\mathrm{p}}$, and a positive correlation between $E_{\mathrm{p}}$ and flux. These observed features can be interpreted within the framework of energy-dependent particle acceleration in blazar jets, which are often associated with turbulence, strong magnetic fields, and relativistic outflows. This work demonstrates that observations from \textit{NICER} can play an important role in blazar variability studies and motivate future multiwavelength campaigns aimed at fully characterizing the dynamical processes in relativistic jets.

### [15] [Pulsars identified in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey at 144 MHz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08663)
*G. A. C. Rijkers,C. G. Bassa,J. R. Callingham,T. Shimwell*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study identifies 80 radio pulsars as unresolved sources in LOFAR LoTSS DR2, validating their positions and flux densities. Polarization-based selection shows promise for future surveys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize radio pulsars in LOFSS data, assess flux density consistency, and develop selection criteria for upcoming surveys.

Method: Astrometric identification of pulsars in LoTSS DR2, comparison with existing data, analysis of polarization properties, and cross-matching with LoLSS for spectral indices.

Result: 80 pulsars identified (≥86% in footprint), 35 detected via polarization, flux agreement except for two pulsars (attributed to nulling/off-pulse emission).

Conclusion: Polarization-based candidate selection is effective. Combining spectral indices from LoLSS enhances detection potential in future surveys.

Abstract: We present the astrometric identification of 80 known radio pulsars as unresolved continuum sources detected at 144 MHz in the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2), which covers 27% of the Northern hemisphere. These identifications represent the majority ($\geq$ 86%) of radio pulsars present in the LoTSS DR2 footprint and provide independent celestial positions and flux densities at 144 MHz. We compare LoTSS flux densities with literature values from various image and time-domain observations and find good agreement for all but two pulsars. We attribute these flux density deviations to intrinsic pulsar properties (nulling and off-pulse emission). We investigate criteria to select promising pulsar candidates using data from the upcoming LoTSS release of the entire Northern sky ($δ>0^\circ$), as well as the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS) at 54 MHz (covering $δ>24^\circ$). Of the 80 detections, 35 (44%) were blindly redetected based on their linear or circular polarization. Therefore we conclude that candidate selection based on polarization properties is a promising approach. Candidate selection can be supplemented with spectral indices via cross-matching to LoLSS sources at 54 MHz, as the high sensitivity of LoTSS is not matched by image-domain surveys at higher frequencies.

### [16] [Low-Mass Neutron Stars and Effective Phase Transitions from a Hybrid Van der Waals-Polytropic Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08672)
*P. H. F. Arruda,S. D. Campos*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates phase transitions in neutron stars using a simplified analytical equation of state (EOS) combining a modified Van der Waals core and a polytropic crust. It demonstrates that such models can capture phase transition signatures and support low-mass neutron star configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore phase-transition-like behavior in neutron stars with an analytically manageable EOS while maintaining thermodynamic and causal consistency. The goal is to provide a simplified framework for studying low-mass neutron star structures and phase transitions at high densities.

Method: The authors use a piecewise EOS coupling a modified van der Waals core to a polytropic crust. They impose thermodynamic and causal conditions, derive critical densities for curvature changes in pressure-energy density relations, solve generalized Lane-Emden equations for core-crust transitions, and integrate Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations across different thermal/interaction parameter regimes (τ₁, σ₁).

Result: The model produces neutron star mass-radius sequences from 0.99 to 2.05 solar masses. Chemical potential shows phase transition signatures at densities above the core-crust matching point. It successfully reproduces key phase transition phenomenology with analytic tractability.

Conclusion: Analytic EOS models adequately capture phase transition behavior in neutron stars and offer a controlled method to study low-mass configurations. This approach provides a valuable tool for further theoretical explorations without full numerical complexity.

Abstract: We study phase-transition-like behavior in neutron stars using a simplified, piecewise equation of state that couples a modified van der Waals-type core to a polytropic crust. The model remains analytically tractable while allowing for nonlinear density dependence. We impose thermodynamic and causal consistency conditions and determine the critical densities at which the curvature of the pressure-energy density relation changes. In the non-relativistic limit, the generalized Lane-Emden equations describe a smooth core-crust transition layer. We integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations across different $(τ_1,σ_1)$ regimes, where these parameters encode thermal and interaction effects in the core. The resulting mass-radius sequences yield low neutron star masses $(0.99-2.05)M_{\odot}$, and the chemical potential exhibits the characteristic signatures of phase-transition behavior at densities well above the matching point. Our results show that analytic EOS models can reproduce the key phenomenology of phase transitions and provide a controlled framework for exploring low-mass neutron star configurations.

### [17] [A magnetar outburst with atypical evolution: the case of Swift J1555.2-5402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08692)
*A. Borghese,F. Coti Zelati,M. Imbrogno,G. L. Israel,D. De Grandis,D. P. Pacholski,M. Trudu,M. Burgay,S. Mereghetti,N. Rea,P. Esposito,M. Pilia,A. Possenti,R. Turolla,L. Ducci*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the 29-month outburst of the magnetar Swift J1555.2-5402 using multi-instrument X-ray and radio observations. Key findings include a prolonged high-flux plateau, persistent ~1.2 keV blackbody spectrum with shrinking emission radius, minimal change in spin-down rate, and lack of radio emission. These observations challenge existing outburst models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the long-term behavior of magnetar outbursts and test theoretical models against观测数据.

Method: Multi-wavelength monitoring with Swift, NICER, NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, Insight-HXMT for X-rays, and Parkes for radio observations. Analysis includes flux evolution, spectral fitting, spin period measurements, and comparison with radio data.

Result: Observed a 500-day flux plateau followed by rapid decline, constant temperature (~1.2 keV) with radius shrinking from ~1.7 km to 0.3 km, stable Pdot (~3.6e-11), and no detected radio signals. These contradict standard magnetar bursting mechanisms.

Conclusion: Current theoretical models fail to explain the sustained high temperatures, prolonged flux plateau, and lack of radio emission. New mechanisms are needed to account for the observed long-term emission characteristics.

Abstract: The magnetar Swift J1555.2-5402 was discovered in outburst on 2021 June 3 by the Burst Alert Telescope on board the Swift satellite. Early X-ray follow-up revealed a spin period P~3.86 s, a period derivative Pdot~3e-11 s/s, dozens of short bursts, and an unusually flux decline. We report here on the X-ray monitoring of Swift J1555.2-5402 over the first ~29 months of its outburst with Swift, NICER, NuSTAR, INTEGRAL and Insight-HXMT, as well as radio observations with Parkes soon after the outburst onset. The observed 0.3-10 keV flux remained at levels >~1e-11 erg/cm^2/s for nearly 500 days before dropping by a factor of ~10 from its June 2021 peak towards the end of the monitoring campaign. During this time span, the spectrum was dominated by a single blackbody, with temperature attaining approximately a constant value (~1.2 keV) while the inferred radius shrank from ~1.7 km to ~0.3 km (assuming a source distance of 10 kpc). The long-term spin-down rate (Pdot~3.6e-11 s/s) is only ~15 % higher than that measured in the first 30 days. No periodic or burst-like radio emission was detected, in line with what has been previously reported using different radio facilities. The persistently high temperature, shrinking hotspot, and a prolonged bright flux plateau followed by a fast dimming observed during the outburst evolution pose a challenge for the outburst mechanisms proposed so far.

### [18] [Optical polarimetry of the accreting black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 over the state transition and radio ejections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08716)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents optical polarimetric observations of Swift J1727.8-1613 during its 2023-2024 outburst, detecting ~1% polarization linked to accretion disk wind scattering. The intrinsic polarization angle's misalignment with the jet suggests a black hole spin-orbit misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the nature of polarization changes during the source's outburst states and explore the origin of intrinsic polarization in black hole systems.

Method: Optical ($BVR$) polarimetric observations were conducted during X-ray state transitions, analyzing polarization degree and angle changes, correcting for interstellar contributions, and correlating with multi-wavelength data.

Result: Detected ~1% polarization (part interstellar) varying with radio ejections, intrinsic polarization remained ~0.3% in the hard-intermediate state. Polarization angle (-15°) deviates from jet axis, indicating spin-orbit misalignment.

Conclusion: Scattering in an optically thin accretion disk wind is the likely polarization source, with the observed misalignment suggesting non-aligned black hole spin and orbital axis.

Abstract: We present the first optical ($BVR$) polarimetric observations of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023--2024 outburst. Observations were performed during the X-ray hard-to-soft state transition, the soft state and the decaying hard state of the source. For the vast majority of nights, we detect statistically significant polarization of ${\approx}1$\%, a fraction of which is of interstellar origin. We find a significant change of polarization coinciding in time with discrete radio ejections. The direction of this polarization variation differs from the directions inferred from the X-ray, sub-mm and radio polarization angles, as well as from the resolved jet orientation. After correcting for the interstellar component, we find that the intrinsic polarization degree remained approximately constant at PD $\approx 0.3$\% throughout the hard-intermediate state. We explore several possible origins for the polarization and conclude that it is most plausibly produced by scattering within the optically thin accretion disk wind. The intrinsic polarization angle, PA $\approx-15°$, is notably offset from the jet axis, which we interpret as evidence for a misalignment between the black hole spin and the orbital axis.

### [19] [Backwards Gamma-Ray Bursts: Searching for Exploding Primordial Black Holes in Short-Duration GRB Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08778)
*Stefano Profumo,Kally Wen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper conducts a systematic search for signs of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) using a forward-modeling framework. Analysis shows that none of the observed sGRBs fit the expected PBH evaporation signature, leading to an upper limit on the local PBH explosion rate. The method offers a robust template-matching approach for future studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether terminal Hawking radiation from primordial black holes (PBHs) can be observed in sGRB data, as such events could provide evidence for quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.

Method: Developed a forward-modeling framework comparing theoretical PBH evaporation light curves (incorporating Standard Model particles and detector responses) with empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzed 39 Swift sGRBs with minimal afterglows, applying Akaike and Bayesian information criteria to compare PBH models against conventional fits.

Result: All sGRBs showed fast-rise, slow-decay profiles inconsistent with PBH predictions. Conventional models (FRED/ERCA) were decisively favored over PBH templates. No PBH candidates were found, setting an upper bound on PBH explosion rate density at ~1e5 pc^-3 yr^-1.

Conclusion: No evidence for terminal PBH evaporation in current sGRB data. The established methodology provides a scalable template-matching tool for future larger surveys, enhancing constraints on quantum gravity phenomena.

Abstract: We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $γ$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.

### [20] [Neutrino pair bremsstrahlung due to electromagnetic collisions in neutron star cores revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08780)
*P. S. Shternin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper examines neutrino pair bremsstrahlung emission in neutron star cores, considering both normal and superconducting proton states. It finds a novel T^(23/3) temperature dependence for non-superconducting matter but lower emissivity than prior work, and restores the standard T^8 scaling for superconducting cases with suppressed nucleon processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately model neutrino emission mechanisms in neutron star cores, which affect stellar cooling rates and interiors. Previous estimates overestimated emissivity, necessitating reevaluation of bremsstrahlung's role under different proton states.

Method: Theoretical analysis of electromagnetic collisions in nucleonic neutron star matter, considering two proton states (normal vs. superconducting). Evaluated transverse in-medium interactions, dynamic vs. static plasma screening effects, and derived emissivity expressions.

Result: For normal protons, emissivity scales as T^(23/3) but is significantly smaller than earlier predictions. In superconducting protons, emissivity follows T^8 scaling, with lepton collisions dominating after nucleon processes are suppressed. Provided analytical formulas for both cases.

Conclusion: Neutrino bremsstrahlung is not a major cooling mechanism in normal neutron star cores but remains relevant in superconducting stages. Results refine neutron star cooling models by correcting emissivity dependencies and dominance hierarchies.

Abstract: We reconsider the problem of neutrino pair bremsstrahlung emission originating from the electromagnetic collisions of charged particles in nucleonic ($npeμ$) neutron star cores. Two limiting cases are considered: (i) protons are in the normal state and (ii) protons are in the superconducting state. In both cases, the dominant contribution to the bremsstrahlung emissivity $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ comes from the transverse part of in-medium electromagnetic interactions. For non-superconducting matter, we obtain an unusual $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}\propto T^{23/3}$ temperature dependence due to the dynamical character of plasma screening in the transverse channel, but considerably smaller values of $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ than in previous studies, rendering the considered process unimportant in practice. In contrast, for superconducting and superfluid matter, the neutrino emission processes involving nucleons are suppressed and $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ due to lepton collisions provides the residual contribution to the neutrino emissivity of neutron star core matter. In the superconducting case, the plasma screening becomes static and the standard $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}\propto T^{8}$ temperature scaling is restored. Simple analytical expressions for $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ in both limiting cases are provided.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data have been used to estimate the masses and radii of the rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, PSR J0437$-$4715, PSR J1231$-$1411, and PSR J0614$-$3329, sometimes in joint analyses with X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) data. These measurements provide invaluable information about the properties of cold, catalyzed matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Here we present the results of our modeling of NICER data on PSR J0437$-$4715 using several different models of hot thermal X-ray emitting spots on the stellar surface. For this pulsar, previous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations established that there is also a modulated nonthermal component to the emission, but the previously published analysis of NICER data did not model this component. We find that the Bayesian evidence is significantly higher when the modulated nonthermal component is included, and that omission of this component leads to poor fits to the bolometric NICER data and thus risks bias in the resulting radius estimates. Our models, which we pursue to inferential convergence, therefore have modulated nonthermal emission, and our headline model has in addition three uniform-temperature thermally-emitting circular spots. Using this model, the symmetric 68% credible range in the radius is 11.8 km to 15.1 km, which at the independently-measured mass of $M=1.418\pm 0.044~M_\odot$ is consistent with previous reports of the radius of the $\sim 1.4~M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0030$+$0451. We discuss the implications of this measurement for the equation of state of dense matter.

TL;DR: The study presents radio-to-X-ray observations of nearby SNe Ic-BL to better understand their link to GRBs, identifying CSM interactions and potential choked jet cocoons, thereby refining models of stellar explosions and multi-messenger astronomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the continuum of outcomes between ordinary SNe Ic-BL and GRBs by analyzing diverse explosion scenarios through multi-wavelength observations.

Method: A coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting 9 nearby SNe Ic-BL (8 new + 1 updated) to monitor radio emissions, probe ejecta velocities, and study interactions with CSM.

Result: Identified radio-loud SNe 2024rjw (CSM interaction) and 2020jqm; established new limits on ejecta properties, with SN 2022xxf as a potential cocoon candidate. Tightened constraints on relativistic SNe Ic-BL frequencies.

Conclusion: Observed diversity in SNe Ic-BL outcomes supports a continuum from choked jets to GRBs, aiding future multi-messenger searches for neutrino counterparts.

Abstract: The observational link between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) is well established. Significant progress has been made in constraining what fraction of SNe Ic-BL may power high- or low-luminosity GRBs when viewed at small off-axis angles. However, the GRB-SN connection still lacks a complete understanding in the broader context of massive-star evolution and explosion physics. Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities. Here, we present results from a coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting nearby (z<=0.1) SNe Ic-BL designed to explore this diversity. With eight new radio-monitored events and updated data for one previously observed SN, we further tighten constraints on the fraction of SNe Ic-BL as relativistic as SN 1998bw/GRB 980425. We identify SN 2024rjw as a new radio-loud event likely powered by strong interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and add evidence supporting a similar interpretation for SN 2020jqm. We also establish new limits on the properties of radio-emitting ejecta with velocities consistent with cocoons from choked jets, highlighting SN 2022xxf as a promising cocoon-dominated candidate. These results refine our understanding of the continuum linking ordinary SNe Ic-BL, engine-driven explosions, and GRBs, and contribute to building a sample that will inform future multi-messenger searches for electromagnetic counterparts to high-energy neutrinos.

### [23] [Self-lensing of moving gravitational-wave sources can break the microlensing crossing timescale degeneracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08898)
*Helena Ubach*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores how gravitational lensing by a massive black hole (MBH) affects gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary mergers. It introduces a method to measure the distance to the MBH and its mass using waveform distortions, which could help constrain source environments and binary parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degeneracy in Einstein radius crossing timescale (t_E) caused by microlensing and to extract parameters like MBH mass and distance from GW signals, avoiding confusion with other distortions in future detectors.

Method: Analyzing the lensing signature of an MBH on GW signals from binary mergers in a Keplerian orbit. The waveform distortion follows a Paczyński curve, with duration independent of MBH mass but dependent on distance. The mass is derived from modulation period (T), GW frequency (f), and t_E via the formula M_MBHz ≈ 2.5×10^6 M☉ (t_E/[100 s]) (f T)^-1.

Result: The method allows simultaneous measurement of d_LS (distance to MBH) and M_MBHz (redshifted mass) using lensing signatures. Ignoring this could lead to misinterpretations of signal distortions in future detectors.

Conclusion: Self-lensing of GW signals provides a unique way to constrain orbital distances, estimate MBH masses, and determine binary inclinations, aiding in understanding astrophysical environments of GW sources.

Abstract: When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczyński curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\rm E}$: $M_{{\rm MBH},z}\simeq 2.5\times 10^6\,M_\odot\,(t_{\rm E}/[100\,{\rm s}])\,(f\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low mass MBHs at the centers of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.

### [24] [Resolving the (Debate About) Nozzle Shocks in Tidal Disruption Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08928)
*Zachary L. Andalman,Eliot Quataert,Eric R. Coughlin,C. J. Nixon*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of nozzle shocks in tidal disruption events (TDEs) caused by stars passing too close to supermassive black holes. Using a combination of simulations, the authors find that while nozzle shocks from vertical compression of debris streams don't directly circularize the debris, they increase stream thickness enough to promote self-intersection on later orbits. This has implications for understanding debris circularization in TDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve debates about the impact of nozzle shocks on debris stream circularization during TDEs and improve models predicting TDE observational signatures.

Method: Integrated 3D SPH simulations, affine model, and 1D finite-volume hydrodynamic simulations to track debris stream evolution at various phases, focusing on nozzle shock dissipation and stream self-intersection dynamics.

Result: The nozzle shock thickens the stream through hydrogen recombination and molecular hydrogen formation, increasing self-intersection probability despite precession. Dissipation alone isn't enough for circularization, but adiabatic effects influence stream dynamics long-term.

Conclusion: Nozzle shock effects are critical for stream self-intersection events that indirectly aid circularization in TDEs, advancing our ability to model TDE emission and evolution.

Abstract: When a star passes within the Roche limit of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), it is pulled apart by the BH's tidal field in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The resulting flare is powered by the circularization and accretion of bound stellar debris, which initially returns to the BH on eccentric orbits in a thin debris stream. The returning fluid elements follow inclined orbits that converge near pericenter, resulting in extreme vertical compression to scales $10^{-4}~R_\odot$ and the formation of a nozzle shock. Dissipation at the nozzle shock may affect circularization by altering the properties of the debris stream, but its role is the subject of ongoing debate. We develop an idealized model for the debris stream evolution combining 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, the semi-analytic affine model, and 1D finite-volume hydrodynamic simulations. Because our model is computationally cheap, we can unambiguously resolve the nozzle shock, use a realistic equation of state, and follow the debris stream evolution at many different times. Near peak fallback, Hydrogen recombination and molecular Hydrogen formation broaden the stream by a factor $\sim 5$, enhancing dissipation at the nozzle. However, the dissipation is still insufficient to directly circularize the debris by in-plane pressure gradients. Instead, the thicker stream substantially increases the likelihood that the stream self-intersects on the second orbit, despite relativistic nodal precession. The stream properties at self-intersection are sensitive to dissipation at the nozzle and the timing of focal points where the ballistic trajectories of the debris converge. Our results clarify the nozzle shock's role in circularization in TDEs, providing a foundation for more realistic circularization and emission models.

### [25] [Impact on orbital period of X-ray Binary system attached to a cosmic string](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07911)
*Ishan Swamy,Deobrat Singh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how cosmic strings interacting with black holes in X-ray binaries can explain unusual orbital period changes, suggesting cosmic string tension in detectable ranges (10^-17 to 10^-11) causes mass loss and spin reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain observed unexpected orbital period changes in Low Mass X-ray binaries and detect cosmic string effects predicted by theory.

Method: Analyzes interaction between cosmic strings and black holes in X-ray binaries, uses existing literature, calculates required string tension (e.g., 10^-17 for 10^-10 period change), and tests across multiple systems.

Result: Shows observable orbital changes occur when string tension ~10^-11, within theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Cosmic strings as an energy-extraction mechanism are viable and observable in X-ray binaries, offering a new detection method for cosmic strings.

Abstract: Cosmic strings attached to rotating black holes extract its rotational energy, resulting in a mass loss and reduced spin. In this paper we discuss the proposed methods to detect these phenomena and present a novel methodology based on existing literature, by considering a Low Mass X-ray binary system. We investigate the impact of a cosmic string interacting with a black hole in an X-ray binary system and attempt to explain the observations of unexpected orbital period changes in such systems by proposing mass loss by cosmic strings to be a potential cause. For a period change of order $10^{-10}$, the string tension is $\sim 10^{-17}$, lying in the predicted range for cosmic string tension. An analysis of multiple low mass X-ray binary systems is carried out and it is shown that a significant and observable change occurs for a string tension $\sim 10^{-11}$.

*Saeed Noori Gashti,Behnam Pourhassan,Izzet Sakallı*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) interact in rainbow gravity-modified Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black holes. By analyzing photon spheres and deflection angles, it shows that rainbow gravity naturally reconciles both conjectures, with specific rainbow functions altering lensing effects and providing testable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore constraints from WGC on gravitational lensing in rainbow gravity, investigate the compatibility between WGC and WCCC, and understand how Planck-scale corrections via rainbow functions affect black hole properties and observables like deflection angles.

Method: The authors use topological methods to analyze photon sphere configurations, derive modified extremal charge-to-mass ratios, and apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem with Jacobi-Maupertuis optical geometry to compute second-order deflection angles for photons and massive particles.

Result: Unstable photon spheres with ω = -1 exist outside the horizon, supporting both WGC and WCCC. Rainbow functions f(ε) and g(ε) modify the metric and extremality bound. Deflection angles depend on g(ε)^{-2} and g(ε)^{-4}, enhancing lensing when g(ε) < 1. Super-extremal objects show stronger lensing than extremal black holes, offering observational tests.

Conclusion: Rainbow gravity provides a framework where WGC and WCCC are simultaneously valid. The derived universal deflection angle at extremality and differential lensing strengths between super-extremal and extremal configurations suggest observational avenues to discriminate between naked singularities and black holes.

Abstract: We investigate the constraints imposed by the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) on gravitational lensing in gravity's rainbow, focusing in particular on scenarios beyond extremality and on the interplay between the WGC and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) in the context of Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black holes modified by rainbow gravity. Using topological methods, we first analyze the configuration of photon spheres and confirm that unstable circular photon spheres with topological charge $(ω= -1)$ exist outside the event horizon throughout the parameter space, thereby verifying the simultaneous validity of both the WGC and the WCCC. The rainbow functions $f(\varepsilon)$ and $g(\varepsilon)$, which encode Planck-scale corrections through the energy ratio $(\varepsilon =E/E_P)$, modify both the spacetime metric and the extremality bound. We derive the corresponding modified extremal charge-to-mass ratio, $(q^2/m^2)>(Q^2/M^2)_{\text{ext}}$, and show that gravity's rainbow offers a natural mechanism for reconciling these two fundamental conjectures. By applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in conjunction with Jacobi-Maupertuis optical geometry, we compute the weak deflection angles for both photons and massive particles to second order. The rainbow function $g(\varepsilon)$ appears with powers $(g^{-2})$ and $(g^{-4})$, enhancing the deflection angle when $g(\varepsilon)<1$, while $f(\varepsilon)$ influences only the charge-dependent contributions. At extremality, the deflection angle becomes independent of $f(\varepsilon)$, yielding a universal prediction that can be tested without specifying the form of the rainbow functions. We further find that super-extremal configurations exhibit stronger lensing effects than extremal black holes, suggesting a potential observational discriminator between WGC-satisfying naked singularities and WCCC-preserving black holes.

Abstract: Perturbative calculations of gravitational radiation near horizons of rotating black holes have been plagued with divergence issues. We derive for the first time a divergence-free source term for such cases within the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. As applications, we compute the dynamical deformation of the event horizon caused by an ultrarelativistic particle plunge, demonstrating the excitation of quasinormal modes at the horizon, and we evaluate the energy flux towards the horizon from an extreme mass-ratio inspiral. This framework provides a powerful tool for studying physics near black hole horizons.

*Matteo Della Rocca,Laura Pezzella,Emanuele Berti,Leonardo Gualtieri,Andrea Maselli*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates how a point particle plunging into a Kerr black hole excites quasinormal modes, finding that higher overtones and subdominant multipoles become more significant for rapidly spinning black holes, improving detection prospects for such modes in highly spinning merger remnants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the gravitational wave signals from black hole mergers by analyzing the excitation of quasinormal modes during ringdown, particularly focusing on the role of remnant spin in determining mode amplitudes.

Method: The authors use a frequency-domain formalism to compute quasinormal mode excitation coefficients for equatorial orbits of a point particle plunging from the innermost stable circular orbit of a Kerr black hole.

Result: Higher overtones and subdominant multipoles of gravitational wave radiation are increasingly significant for rapidly rotating black holes, suggesting enhanced detection potential for these modes in highly spinning remnant scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights that merger remnants with high spins are more likely to produce detectable higher-order quasinormal modes, which could provide valuable observational tests of black hole dynamics and general relativity.

Abstract: The remnant of a black hole binary merger settles into a stationary configuration by "ringing down" through the emission of gravitational waves that consist of a superposition of damped exponentials with discrete complex frequencies - the remnant black hole's quasinormal modes. While the frequencies themselves depend solely on the mass and spin of the remnant, the mode amplitudes depend on the merger dynamics. We investigate quasinormal mode excitation by a point particle plunging from the innermost stable circular orbit of a Kerr black hole. Our formalism is general, but we focus on computing the quasinormal mode excitation coefficients in the frequency domain for equatorial orbits, and we analyze their dependence on the remnant black hole spin. We find that higher overtones and subdominant multipoles of the radiation become increasingly significant for rapidly rotating black holes. This suggests that the prospects for detecting overtones and higher-order modes are considerably enhanced for highly spinning merger remnants.

### [29] [Analytical Study for Primordial Non-Gaussianity in the gravity 4D Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08047)
*A. Agung,U. Sambiri,G. Hikmawan,F. P. Zen*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the non-Gaussianity of the 4DEGB inflationary model using Planck Collaboration data, finding it matches local-type features similar to single-field inflation, supporting its validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the 4DEGB model's non-Gaussianity parameters effectively constrain cosmological inflation models by comparing them against observational data.

Method: The in-in formalism was applied to calculate the 3-point correlation function (bispectrum) of curvature perturbations (ζ), focusing on the squeezed limit and local shape function.

Result: The model exhibits a dominant local-type non-Gaussian signature in the slow-roll scenario under the squeezed limit, aligning with single-field inflation predictions, and validates the topological invariance of the Gauss-Bonnet term in D<5 dimensions.

Conclusion: The 4DEGB model's non-Gaussianity parameters are viable for constraining inflationary models, as supported by Planck data, and the Gauss-Bonnet term's invariance justifies its irrelevance in lower-dimensional gravitational dynamics.

Abstract: An inflationary model can be constrained by non-gaussian statistics as a parameter in the LSS (Large Scale Structure) distribution, and in the radiation of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) fluctuating temperature. Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $ζ$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant, and no influence gravitational field equations in $D<5$ spacetimes.

*Jonathan Holland*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a mesoscopic framework coupling cosmological horizons to quantum subsystems, explaining baryon depletion via horizon reservoirs and an infrared return channel. Photons follow horizontal geodesics in a Carnot-Carathéodory geometry, creating a cosmic cavity with a Planck spectrum linked to cosmic expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve discrepancies in baryon conservation and cosmic dynamics by addressing missing charge/entropy across horizons and unify explanations for photon equilibrium, rotation curves, and cosmic expansion through infrared geometric modes.

Method: Formulates a mesoscopic model treating the universe's exterior as an open quantum system interacting with a horizon reservoir. Uses local conservation laws with compensating source terms and introduces a Carnot-Carathéodory tangent geometry governing IR fluctuations and photon/matter propagation.

Result: Derives an infrared return channel restoring entropy/charge, a cosmic cavity with Planck spectrum from horizon-scale geometry, and connects the mesoscopic scale σ to Hubble expansion (H~σ), unifying baryon balance, photon equilibrium, and rotation curve flatness.

Conclusion: Semiclassical gravity inherently requires infrared return channels at horizons, and the mesoscopic scale σ unifies cosmological phenomena, offering a new framework for understanding cosmic evolution without dark matter/energy via geometric modifications.

Abstract: We develop a mesoscopic framework in which the cosmological exterior is treated as an open quantum subsystem coupled to a horizon reservoir. Local conservation laws, expressed as $\nabla_μ\langle J^μ\rangle=0$, imply that when baryon number is lost across a horizon its conserved quantum numbers are sequestered into inaccessible modes, producing an effective depletion in the exterior sector. Global unitarity therefore requires compensating source terms in the exterior continuity equations. We show that relativity forces these compensating excitations to arise through long-wavelength geometric modes: only infrared fluctuations can restore entropy and charge while remaining outside the causal wedge of the infalling matter. This identifies an infrared return channel as a generic feature of horizon-coupled semiclassical gravity.
  The second ingredient is a Carnot-Carathéodory (CC) tangent geometry, whose mesoscopic scale $σ$ governs both the excitation of these IR modes and the kinematics of photon and matter propagation. In this setting, photon trajectories follow recurrent horizontal geodesics, producing an effective cosmic cavity whose stationary state is a Planck spectrum set by $σ$. The same scale modifies large-radius circular motions in a way consistent with flattened rotation curves. Horizon thermodynamics and mesoscopic balance laws then link $σ$ to the cosmic expansion rate, $H\simσ$, yielding a unified infrared structure underlying photon equilibrium, baryon balance, and large-scale kinematics.

### [31] [Noble gravitational atoms: Self-gravitating black hole scalar wigs with angular momentum number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08095)
*Miguel Alcubierre,Juan Barranco,Argelia Bernal,Juan Carlos Degollado,Alberto Diez-Tejedor,Miguel Megevand,Dario Nunez,Olivier Sarbach*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'noble gravitational atoms'—self-gravitating scalar field configurations around black holes with angular momentum ℓ, analogous to ℓ-boson stars. These solutions show distinct density profiles near the event horizon and can have sizes, densities, and lifespans comparable to cosmic structures like galaxies and the universe itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations with angular momentum ℓ, extending the concept of ℓ-boson stars to create 'gravitational atoms' with stable, closed-shell-like configurations. This helps understand self-gravitating systems beyond simple boson stars, especially their behavior near black holes.

Method: Using a quasi-stationary approximation, the authors construct solutions by adapting methods from ℓ-boson star analysis. They model scalar field configurations around black holes, focusing on how angular momentum ℓ ≥ 0 affects density distributions and stability.

Result: Noble gravitational atoms differ from ℓ-boson stars near the event horizon, with density maxima at large radii for ℓ > 0, minimal density near the horizon for ℓ > 1, and possible dips instead of spikes at the horizon. For ℓ=0, spikes exist but contribute negligibly to mass density. These objects can have astronomical scales and lifetimes, resembling dark matter or galactic structures.

Conclusion: The study expands the range of possible self-gravitating systems around black holes, suggesting these 'noble gravitational atoms' could explain large-scale cosmic phenomena. Their diverse parameters and stability indicate potential relevance to astrophysical and cosmological contexts, such as dark matter or long-lived structures.

Abstract: We present new spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations in a quasi-stationary approximation that describe self-gravitating scalar field configurations around a black hole, including angular momentum number $\ell$. An approach analogous to the one which gives rise to $\ell$-boson stars is used here to construct self-gravitating ``gravitational atoms" with $\ell\ge0$. We refer to these new solutions as {\it noble gravitational atoms}, by analogy with noble atoms, which are characterized by closed electron shells. We show that, in the proper limit, noble gravitational atoms approach $\ell$-boson stars globally, displaying noticeable differences only in a region very close to the event horizon. Noble gravitational atoms with $\ell>0$ sometimes present density maxima located at relatively large radii, with small density close to the horizon for $\ell>1$. Furthermore, they do not always present the typical density spike at the event horizon if $\ell > 0$; on the contrary, they sometimes exhibit a small dip there. When $\ell=0$, a spike can appear, but its contribution to the total mass density is always negligible. The size, density, and lifetime of these objects vary significantly depending on the parameters, being in some cases as large as galaxies, as dilute as dark matter, and as long-lived as the Universe itself.

### [32] [High-overtone ringdown fits: start time, no-hair tests, and correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08098)
*Erin Coleman,Eliot Finch*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates how additional overtones in ringdown signals enhance information extraction, finding diminishing utility per overtone but a significant role in detecting GR deviations through joint amplitude correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the practical utility of higher overtones in ringdown analysis and assess their potential for testing general relativistic predictions despite uncertainties in their excitation levels.

Method: Uses Bayesian parameter estimation to evaluate posterior distributions of overtone amplitudes and phases, examines the impact of ringdown start time selection and correlations among parameters.

Result: No clear maximum overtone exists; higher overtones' individual parameters become difficult to measure due to strong correlations, but joint amplitudes reveal sensitivity to high overtone properties, offering a tool for GR consistency tests.

Conclusion: While each subsequent overtone contributes less individually, their collective analysis provides a viable method to probe general relativistic predictions in ringdown signals.

Abstract: Overtones are known to improve the performance of fits to the ringdown, both in numerical-relativity simulations and gravitational-wave observations. Although the overtone frequencies are a concrete prediction of general relativity, it remains an open question whether they are excited to the extent that fits would suggest. In this work, we take a pragmatic approach and investigate the practical utility of each additional overtone in extracting information from the ringdown. We look at the dependence of the ringdown start time on the number of overtones, and the feasibility of detecting deviations from general relativity in the ringdown frequencies. We suggest that there is no clear "maximum" overtone, but rather the utility of each additional overtone decreases compared to the one before. Finally, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation (as opposed to least-squares fits) to obtain posterior distributions on the overtone amplitudes and phases, allowing us to investigate their correlation structure. Due to strong correlations it becomes increasingly hard to measure individual amplitudes and phases for the highest overtones. However, we find that the joint measurement of overtone amplitudes (i.e., the correlation structure itself) is sensitive to the frequencies and decay times of even the highest overtones, possibly offering an avenue to perform consistency tests with general relativity.

*Marcos R. Ribeiro,Eveling C. Ribeiro,Kai Lin,Elcio Abdalla*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study explores the linear stability of a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell black hole solution exposed to a uniform magnetic field, focusing on charged scalar field dynamics via quasinormal modes (QNMs). It identifies a critical charge value where QNM spectra show a universal 1/2 power-law scaling, linking to a transition between confined (field trapped within ~1/B radius) and deconfined regimes (field extends to much larger distances with reduced damping).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how magnetic fields influence black hole stability and scalar field behavior, with implications for high-energy astrophysics and fundamental field theory.

Method: Combining frequency-domain and time-domain analyses to study quasinormal modes of a charged scalar field interacting with magnetized Einstein-Maxwell black holes.

Result: Discovered a critical charge value causing power-law scaling (exponent ~1/2) in QNM spectra, indicating a phase transition between confined and deconfined field behaviors dependent on magnetic field strength.

Conclusion: The findings offer both qualitative insights into magnetic confinement effects on electromagnetic interactions near black holes and quantitative benchmarks for modeling magnetic compact objects in astrophysics.

Abstract: Black holes (BHs) in magnetized environments are a topic of intense research, both theoretical and observational. In particular, the interaction between charged matter and such objects provides a rich arena with applications ranging from fundamental field theory to high-energy astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the linear stability of a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell solution describing a static, axially symmetric BH immersed in a uniform magnetic field. We probe the dynamics of an external charged scalar field through its quasinormal modes (QNMs), combining frequency- and time-domain analyses. We find a critical value of the field charge at which the QNM spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of approximately $1/2$. This critical behavior admits a simple interpretation in terms of a transition between a confined regime, where waves remain effectively trapped within a region of characteristic size $\sim 1/B$, and a deconfined regime, where the field reaches distances $\gg 1/B$ and the damping rate becomes parametrically small. These results provide qualitative and quantitative insights that may inform more realistic scenarios involving highly magnetized compact objects.

*Chikun Ding,Yuebing Zhou,Yu Shi,Xiangyun Fu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines black hole solutions and gravitational wave polarizations in a M-subset of Einstein-aether theory, revealing differences in black hole existence based on aether's timelike/spacelike nature, and analyzes mode speeds and polarization behavior in this modified gravity framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate Lorentz-violating gravitational phenomena in Einstein-aether theory's M-subset, addressing discrepancies in previous black hole solution findings and exploring the effects of aether field orientation.

Method: Analyzed the M-subset with a Lagrange multiplier potential, derived D-dimensional black hole solutions, applied extended Killing potential method for Smarr formula/first law, and performed linearized analysis of gravitational wave modes.

Result: Timelike aether prevents static black holes; spacelike aether allows Reissner-Nordstrom-like solutions with bounded aether charges. Gravitational modes show unit speeds independent of dimension/parameters, with some polarization components absent.

Conclusion: The M-subset exhibits unique black hole properties and gravitational mode behaviors under Lorentz violation, offering new insights into aether theory dynamics and constraints for modified gravity models.

Abstract: We study the black hole solution and gravitational wave polarizations in a M-subset of the Einstein-aether theory with Lorentz invariance violated by an unit norm vector field -- the aether field $u^a$. This M-subset of Einstein-aether theory has a form of Einstein-Maxwell theory with a term of Lagrange multiplier potential $λ(u_au^a\mp1)$. We find that if the aether field is timelike, there is no static black hole solution existing, which is different from the result reported in Phys. Rev. D {\bf64} 024028. When the aether field is spacelike, there exists a static solution -- $D$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole solution, in which the aether charge have a minimum and maximum values. The conception of the aether charge also exists in the $c_i$ subset of the Einstein-aether theory. The Smarr formula and the first law can be still constructed via the extended method of Killing potential. For the linearized M-subset Einstein-aether theory with the timelike aether field, we find the speed of spin-2 modes is unit, which aren't dependent on spacetime dimensions $D$ and aether constant $b_1$, but some parts of polarizations are disappeared. The speed of spin-1 modes is unit also. The third kind mode is the longitudinal aether-metric mode, which is linearly time dependent and not the spin-0 mode.

### [35] [Probing Cosmic Strings via Black Hole Quasinormal Modes in Gravitational Wave Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08368)
*Ishan Swamy,Deobrat Singh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to detect cosmic strings by analyzing their effects on the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of non-rotating black holes. Numerical simulations establish detectability thresholds for string perturbations, offering a new observational strategy for cosmic strings using gravitational waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of binary black holes via gravitational waves (GWs) has opened new possibilities for probing cosmic phenomena like dark matter and cosmic strings. However, cosmic strings, hypothesized topological defects from the early universe, remain undetected. This paper aims to develop a method to detect cosmic strings by observing their imprint on black hole QNMs, leveraging GW observations.

Method: The authors model cosmic strings as perturbations in the spacetime of non-rotating black holes, then perform numerical simulations to analyze how these perturbations affect QNM spectra. They compute thresholds for perturbation strength (λ) below which cosmic string effects become undetectable, and study eigenvalue splitting/centers to identify distinct GW features.

Result: Simulations determined detectability thresholds: λ ~10^-10 for uncharged strings and ~10^-7 for charged strings. The analysis shows that string properties leave unique signatures in QNM spectra, making them observable via advanced GW detectors like upgraded LIGO.

Conclusion: QNM analysis provides a powerful alternative approach to constrain or detect cosmic strings, potentially enabling estimates of string energy/charge if signals are found. This method expands observational strategies for cosmic strings and highlights future potential with improved GW detection technologies.

Abstract: Black holes, the simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, do not emit light, making their observations a major challenge for researchers. However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $λ\sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $λ\sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected. With upgrades in LIGO technologies and advanced multimessenger astronomy under development, these findings highlight new potential for detecting cosmic strings.

Abstract: We show how to coherently combine information from a population of sub-threshold, gravitational-wave binary neutron star post-merger remnants. Although no individual event in our synthetic population can be claimed as a confident detection, we show how to statistically determine the fraction of merger events that promptly collapse to form a black hole, compared to those for which a neutron star survives the merger for at least tens of milliseconds. This fraction, when combined with information about the neutron star mass distribution gleaned from the inspiral portion of the signals, provides an indirect measure of the neutron star maximum mass. Using conservative measures of the post-merger waveforms, we show that 50-70 events with binary neutron star inspiral measurements can be combined to give an $11-20\%$ fractional uncertainty on the maximum mass of rapidly rotating, hot neutron stars, which can potentially be turned into a $12-21\%$ fractional constraint on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. We discuss how this measure of the hot nuclear equation of state can be combined with information of cold neutron stars to see the effect of temperature on physics in the densest regions of the Universe.

Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) poses significant challenges for data analysis and parameter inference in future space-based gravitational-wave missions, such as LISA and Taiji, as it appears as an additional stochastic component along with instrumental noise. Previous studies have developed various approaches to distinguish the SGWB from instrumental noise, often under simplified assumptions such as static or equal-arm configurations. However, in realistic scenarios, time-varying arm-lengths introduce additional complexities that require careful modeling. In this work, we investigate the impact of template construction on SGWB parameter estimation under realistic orbital configurations. Using the simulated SGWB signals and dominant instrumental noise sources, we compare three template strategies: time-averaged template constructed from segmented data, equal-arm template, and a template treating the arm-lengths as a free parameter. Our results show that the time-averaged template yield improves parameter estimation accuracy under time-varying arm-lengths, whereas introducing the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases estimation uncertainty. These findings highlight the importance of realistic template construction for high-precision SGWB analysis in future space-based missions.

TL;DR: The study examines how radiative processes in three entangled quantum probes (initially in a W state) are influenced by probe configurations, velocities, switching scenarios, and thermal environments. It highlights dependencies on initial arrangements and velocity directions, and suggests setups to minimize decoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different configurations and environmental factors affect radiative processes in entangled quantum systems, aiding in designing systems resilient to decoherence.

Method: Investigated radiative processes of three entangled probes in flat spacetime under static or uniformly moving conditions. Explored various switching scenarios and extended analysis to thermal environments.

Result: Radiation significantly depends on probe arrangement and velocity direction. Thermal environments and switching scenarios notably influence outcomes. Guidelines for minimizing decoherence effects were proposed.

Conclusion: Initial configurations, velocity direction, thermal effects, and switching methods critically impact radiative processes in entangled systems. The findings provide practical insights for optimizing experimental setups to reduce quantum decoherence.

Abstract: We study the radiative process of three entangled quantum probes initially prepared in a tripartite W state. As a basic set-up, we consider the probes to be inertial in flat spacetime and investigate how the radiative process is affected by different probe configurations. We take the quantum probes as either static or moving with uniform velocities and consider different switching scenarios. Our main observation confirms that the radiative process depends distinctively on the initial configuration in which the probes are arranged, as well as on the direction of the probe velocity. We also extend our analysis to a thermal environment, thereby simulating a more realistic background. We thoroughly discuss the effects due to different switchings, the thermal background, and probe motion on the radiative process of these tripartite entangled probes. We also comment on how the observations from this work can help prepare a set-up least affected by quantum decoherence.

TL;DR: The paper examines acceleration radiation from atoms falling into a Schwarzschild black hole using a massive spin-1 (Proca) field within the HBAR framework. It identifies universal thermal properties and unique Proca signatures like mass thresholds and polarization effects, leading to a master equation with an area-entropy relation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how vector fields (Proca) affect acceleration radiation near black holes, extending scalar field studies, and to probe polarization-dependent phenomena in curved spacetime.

Method: Quantum-optical analysis using charged-monopole and electric-dipole detector models in a cavity, near-horizon stationary-phase approximation, and transition from single-pass probabilities to escape rates via master equations.

Result: Identified universal Rindler coordinate-dependent thermal balance factor, distinct Proca signatures (mass threshold, polarization factors, greybody transmissions), and a geometric steady-state with HBAR-like area-entropy relation insensitive to vector specifics except radiative area changes.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of probing longitudinal/transverse responses and mass effects in black hole acceleration radiation, providing groundwork for future studies on rotating spacetimes and other states.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a quantum-optical treatment of acceleration radiation for atoms freely falling into a Schwarzschild black hole when the ambient field is a massive spin-1 (Proca) field. Building on the HBAR framework of Scully and collaborators, we analyze two detector realizations: a charged-monopole current coupling and a physical electric-dipole coupling, both within a cavity that isolates a single outgoing Schwarzschild mode prepared in the Boulware state. Using a near-horizon stationary-phase analysis, we show that the thermal detailed-balance factor governing excitation versus absorption is universal and depends only on the near-horizon Rindler coordinate transformation. At the same time, the absolute spectra acquire distinctive Proca signatures: a hard mass threshold, polarization-dependent prefactors, and axial/polar greybody transmissions. Promoting single-pass probabilities to escaping rates yields a master equation whose steady state is geometric and whose entropy flux obeys an HBAR-style area-entropy relation identical in form to the scalar case, with all vector-field specifics entering through the radiative area change. Our results provide a controlled pathway to probe longitudinal versus transverse responses, mass thresholds, and polarization-resolved greybody effects in acceleration radiation, and set the stage for extensions to rotating backgrounds, alternative exterior states, and detector-engineering strategies.

TL;DR: This paper examines the quantum and radiative properties of a Lorentz-violating bumblebee black hole, analyzing particle production, absorption cross sections, and emission rates compared to other geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Lorentz symmetry violation affects black hole thermodynamics and radiation, using the static bumblebee black hole as a model system.

Method: Calculates thermodynamic temperature from surface gravity, uses tunneling method for particle production analysis, derives greybody factors via sixth-order WKB and quasinormal modes, and compares results across different Lorentz-violating models.

Result: Spin-dependent absorption peaks, computed greybody factors, evaporation lifetimes, and emission rates show distinct behaviors compared to other Lorentz-violating black holes, especially in high-frequency regimes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Lorentz-violating bumblebee geometry produces unique spin-dependent radiation patterns, offering insights into quantum gravity phenomena and distinguishing effects among different Lorentz-breaking models.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum and radiative properties of a recently proposed static bumblebee black hole arising from a general Lorentz-violating vacuum configuration. The analysis begins with the geometric structure of the solution and the thermodynamic temperature obtained from the surface-gravity prescription. The associated thermodynamic topological structure is also examined. Quantum particle production is then analyzed for bosonic and fermionic fields using the tunneling method. Analytic greybody bounds are derived for spin-0, spin-1, spin-2, and spin-1/2 fields. Furthermore, full greybody factors are computed with the sixth-order WKB method, together with the corresponding absorption cross sections and their characteristic spin-dependent peak patterns. These results support the evaluation of the evaporation lifetimes and the emission rates of energy and particle modes associated with each spin contribution, followed by a comparison of the high-frequency regime with other Lorentz-violating geometries, including the \textit{metric} bumblebee, \textit{metric-affine} bumblebee, Kalb-Ramond, and non-commutative Kalb-Ramond black holes. In addition, greybody factors are obtained using a quasinormal-mode-based prescription.

Abstract: We introduce and study \emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings.

*Tian-Yu Chen,Yong-Zhuang Li,Xiao-Mei Kuang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines how non-mininal coupling in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory affects black hole optical properties using a plasma accretion disk model. Key findings show coupling reduces ISCO and photon sphere sizes, alters photon impact parameters, enhances redshift, and reduces image brightness compared to Schwarzschild/Reissner-Nordström cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of non-minimal coupling parameters on black hole orbital dynamics and observable properties like photon behavior, redshift, and accretion disk emissions.

Method: Orbital dynamics analysis of massive/massless particles around a non-minimally coupled black hole in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory using accretion disk models. Calculations tracked ISCO, photon sphere radii, energy/angular momentum, impact parameters, and emission intensities under varying coupling strengths.

Result: Increasing non-minimal coupling linearly reduces ISCO/photon sphere radii, narrows photon impact parameter ranges, increases redshift, and diminishes observed image intensity compared to uncharged/charged black hole counterparts.

Conclusion: Non-minimal coupling significantly modifies black hole optical characteristics, offering new observational signatures to distinguish between different black hole theories through accretion disk emissions and lensing effects.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of a black hole in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, illuminated by a thin accretion disk composed of free, electrically neutral plasma. In our setup, matter follows stable circular orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), while inside the ISCO, it rapidly plunges into the black hole. We begin by analyzing the orbital dynamics of massive and massless particles around the black hole. Our results indicate that as the non-minimal coupling parameter increases, the radii of both the ISCO and the photon sphere, together with the corresponding energy and angular momentum for massive particles or the impact parameter for photons, decrease approximately linearly. Moreover, compared with the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström black holes, the non-minimal coupling extends the range of the impact parameter and slightly enhances the redshift effect in the images. Additionally, due to the significant influence of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the event horizon, the observed intensity of the non-minimally coupled black hole image under the selected emission model ultimately turns out to be weaker than that of the other two types of black holes, regardless of the inclination angle between the accretion disk and observation planes.

Motivation: To understand the statistical behavior of nonlinear gravitational wave turbulence and identify how energy transfer occurs through multipoles in such systems.

Method: Derivation of a kinetic Boltzmann equation to model the evolution of gravitational wave multipoles' statistical properties, analyzing the system's behavior under large graviton injection with high multipoles.

Result: Injection of a large number of gravitons with high multipoles leads the system to an inverse multipole cascade as time increases, indicating energy transfer towards lower multipoles.

Conclusion: The inverse cascade phenomenon in gravitational wave turbulence is statistically validated through the derived Boltzmann equation, highlighting the role of multipole interactions in energy redistribution.

Abstract: We derive a kinetic Boltzmann equation characterizing the long-term statistical behavior of the turbulent dynamics of nonlinear interacting gravitational wave multipoles in Minkowski spacetime and show that, injecting a large number of gravitons with large multipoles drives the system toward an inverse multipole cascade at large times.

*Erdinç Ulaş Saka*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a black hole with a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. The halo's parameter 'a' breaks the isospectrality observed in vacuum cases. While the halo affects fundamental modes moderately and overtones weakly, no significant amplitude enhancements are found, suggesting minimal exotic effects. The results indicate that dark matter halos cause controlled modifications to the ringdown spectrum without altering its basic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how dark matter halos influence black hole quasinormal modes, particularly breaking isospectrality and assessing potential strong near-horizon effects compared to vacuum or exotic objects.

Method: Computed fundamental and overtone QNMs for a regular, asymptotically flat black hole with a Dehnen-type matter halo. Analyzed gravitational perturbations splitting into two axial sectors, studying the effect of varying the halo parameter 'a' on the quasinormal spectrum.

Result: The halo parameter 'a' moderately affects fundamental mode frequencies but weakly impacts overtones. No significant overtone amplitude growth occurs, unlike quantum-corrected/exotic objects. The spectrum's qualitative structure remains intact.

Conclusion: Dark matter halos introduce mild, controlled modifications to the ringdown spectrum, preserving its fundamental structure and not inducing strong near-horizon effects characteristic of more exotic objects.

Abstract: We compute the fundamental and overtone quasinormal modes of a regular, asymptotically flat black hole supported by a Dehnen-type matter halo. Gravitational perturbations in this background split into two distinct axial sectors, and our analysis confirms that the presence of the halo parameter $a$ breaks the isospectrality that holds in vacuum. The dependence of the quasinormal spectrum on $a$ is moderate for the fundamental modes and even weaker for the overtones, which approach one another in the complex-frequency plane as the halo parameter increases. No enhancement or rapid growth of overtone amplitudes is observed, indicating that the halo does not induce the type of strong near-horizon effects characteristic of quantum-corrected or exotic compact objects. Overall, our results show that the dark-matter halo introduces controlled and comparatively mild modifications to the ringdown spectrum while preserving its qualitative structure.

Abstract: The expansion of commercial launch capabilities has significantly increased opportunities for interplanetary small satellite (SmallSat) missions. As researchers plan for more missions beyond Earth, there is a demand for accessible tools that help better predict and understand the thermal effects on their spacecraft in orbital environments around Earth and other bodies. While commercial thermal analysis tools offer high-fidelity modeling capabilities and results, they are often expensive and require extensive training to be used effectively. This paper details a framework for a user-friendly Satellite Thermal Model (SATMO) to support the early stages of space mission planning for CubeSats orbiting Earth and other Solar System bodies. SATMO is an open-source, MATLAB-based, six-node thermal analysis program designed for satellites in low-altitude circular orbits. Although SATMO requires a MATLAB license -- typically inexpensive or institutionally provided in academic settings -- it remains substantially more accessible than professional thermal analysis software. SATMO requires an internet connection for some features but does not rely on additional MATLAB toolboxes. The SATMO modeling approach is validated with the space industry standard Thermal Desktop software, with temperatures comparable to within 1.17$^\circ$C for a 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm CubeSat in various configurations, orbiting around primary bodies including Earth, Venus, and Mars. An example use case of SATMO is presented with a Mars-orbiting CubeSat to demonstrate its functionalities and the outputs available to users. SATMO offers increased accessibility to satellite thermal modeling for the research community, enabling quick thermal trade studies and interplanetary mission plans.

Abstract: Interstellar objects such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov offer a unique window into the formation and evolution of other star systems, yet the tracking and analysis of their trajectories remain limited to specialized research institutions. Existing interstellar and solar system datasets are large, complex, and difficult to navigate, reducing accessibility for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. To address this, we present The Interstellar Signature: a computational framework for open-source interstellar tracking, implemented through a web-based platform.
  Interstellar Signature bridges raw astronomical data and an intuitive, developer-friendly interface. The framework integrates live data streams from public repositories and APIs with physics-based simulation methods to model and visualize the motion of interstellar and solar system objects in real time. The platform supports interactive visualizations, comparative orbital analysis, and modular tools that allow users to explore and extend the system for research, experimentation, or development.
  As an open-source project, the framework encourages collaboration and hands-on engagement with complex datasets. It exists within NexusCosmos, an ecosystem envisioned as a "Linux for the space race," aimed at democratizing access to space science tools and data. By transforming large datasets into visual, interactive, and customizable simulations, Interstellar Signature expands participation in interstellar research and observation.
  Future extensions will add AI-driven trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and advanced visualization. By combining open-source accessibility with computational rigor, this framework lowers the barrier to interstellar analysis and serves as a step toward bridging professional astronomy and public scientific engagement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the possibility of detecting advanced extraterrestrial civilizations by analyzing microlensing events modulated by Dyson Sphere-like structures.

Method: Developed a probabilistic framework with stochastic transmission models, parameter scans, and heatmaps for optical transit durations. Analyzed infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelengths, as well as effective optical depth and anomalous microlensing rates.

Result: Identified observable signatures (modulated light curves, infrared excesses) and provided tools (heatmaps, optical depth metrics) to search for Dyson Swarm-like structures via microlensing anomalies.

Conclusion: Microlensing studies can be extended to detect dynamic artificial structures, offering a new method to search for extraterrestrial civilizations.

Abstract: We investigate the microlensing detectability of extraterrestrial technosignatures originating from Dyson sphere \textendash like structures, such as Dyson Swarms surrounding primordial black holes (PBHs). These hypothetical swarms consist of stochastically varying, partially opaque structures that could modulate standard microlensing light curves through time-dependent transmission effects. We introduce a probabilistic framework that includes a stochastic transmission model governed by variable optical depth and random gap distributions. We perform a parameter scan and generate heatmaps of the optical transit duration. We study the infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelength as complementary observational signatures. Additionally, we define and analyze the effective optical depth and the anomalous microlensing event rate for these stochastic structures. Our findings provide a new avenue for searching for extraterrestrial advanced civilizations by extending microlensing studies to include artificial, dynamic modulation signatures.

Abstract: The Roman Coronagraph's capabilities in the faint star, small IWA limit has enormous scientific (programmatic) impacts. Testing its performance in this limit provides a first look at challenges that may be encountered with the Habitable Worlds Observatory in imaging rocky planets around the nearest K and M stars. We propose such a rigorous test with the HLC/575nm targeting a newly-discovered superjovian planet HIP 54515 b, whose predicted contrast is $\sim$4.7 $\times$10$^{-8}$--2.5 $\times$10$^{-7}$. The companion lies close to the coronagraph IWA (well interior to the TTR5 performance region) and orbits a V = 6.8 star, near the limit for which the coronagraph may yield deep contrasts. Multiple reference stars are available that will further test CGI's performance as a function of $Δ$ pitch angle to assess how the telescope's thermal environment impacts contrasts.

Abstract: Conventional ground-based optical telescopes, even those with large apertures, primarily observe stars, close binaries, and multiple systems as unresolved point sources through photometric measurements. Spectroscopy can identify multiple stellar components within a system, but both techniques are fundamentally limited in resolving stellar surfaces and providing direct angular separations. Although photometric and spectroscopic observations yield critical information on magnitudes/flux, metallicities, and orbital properties, complementary high-angular-resolution methods are required to constrain additional system characteristics, including angular orbital parameters, model-independent distances, radii, and stellar masses. The limitations of these two methods arise due to the Diffraction Limit of the telescopes and atmospheric turbulence. Speckle Interferometry (SI) is a clever and affordable method for ground-based telescopes to work around atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we utilize the speckle images obtained by the 3.6 m DOT and demonstrate the capability of SI to resolve binary systems, measure their orbital separations, and determine their position angles. For systems with faint companions where conventional analysis fails, we employ Bayesian inference to model speckle patterns and estimate orbital parameters with high precision. These results establish the effective methodology for using a medium-sized, 4-m class telescope like the DOT as a high-resolution stellar interferometer and demonstrate the potential of speckle interferometry as a powerful technique to advance optical interferometric studies within Indian astronomy.

TL;DR: PolySwyft is a novel non-amortized simulation-based inference method combining nested sampling and neural ratio estimation to efficiently explore complex, multimodal posterior distributions with intractable likelihoods. It demonstrated faster convergence and mode recovery in cosmological parameter inference using fewer simulator calls.

Motivation: Address the challenges of Bayesian inference when likelihoods are intractable but simulators are available, particularly for high-dimensional multimodal posteriors in astrophysical applications like cosmology.

Method: Integrates nested sampling (NS) with neural ratio estimation (NRE), nesting NRE rounds within NS exploration phases. Uses a KL-divergence criterion to adaptively terminate sampling, ensuring Bayesian validity while improving efficiency.

Result: Outperforms swyft's TNRE in toy problems (5D/100D Gaussian and mixture models), recovering all modes and credible regions with fewer simulator calls. Successfully infers 6D cosmological parameters from CMB data via CosmoPower.

Conclusion: PolySwyft provides a robust, efficient framework for Bayesian inference in complex scenarios, released as open-source to facilitate adoption in astrophysics and beyond.

Abstract: We present PolySwyft, a novel, non-amortised simulation-based inference framework that unites the strengths of nested sampling (NS) and neural ratio estimation (NRE) to tackle challenging posterior distributions when the likelihood is intractable but a forward simulator is available. By nesting rounds of NRE within the exploration of NS, and employing a principled KL-divergence criterion to adaptively terminate sampling, PolySwyft achieves faster convergence on complex, multimodal targets while rigorously preserving Bayesian validity. On a suite of toy problems with analytically known posteriors of a dim(theta,D)=(5,100) multivariate Gaussian and multivariate correlated Gaussian mixture model, we demonstrate that PolySwyft recovers all modes and credible regions with fewer simulator calls than swyft's TNRE. As a real-world application, we infer cosmological parameters dim(theta,D)=(6,111) from CMB power spectra using CosmoPower. PolySwyft is released as open-source software, offering a flexible toolkit for efficient, accurate inference across the astrophysical sciences and beyond.

Abstract: The focal plane assembly of wavefront camera is the key imaging device of wavefront detection camera and the key load of the exoplanet imaging coronagraph module. In order to ensure the imaging quality and reduce the dark current and thermal noise, it is necessary to effectively dissipate the heat of the focal plane CCD and other high-power electronic devices to ensure the working performance and reliability of the focal plane assembly. Based on the limited space and cooling resources, this paper adopts the flexible graphene heat conducting cable and grooved heat pipes, and carries out detailed thermal design and thermal analysis of its cooling path. The finite element model is established by thermal analysis software and thermal simulation is carried out. in that steady state, the work temperature range of the CCD chip is -12.8 to -10.9 celsius, which meets the temperature control index, and the work temperatures of other components are also within the design requirements, which indicate that the thermal design scheme is reasonable and feasible, and meets the task requirements.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents an end-to-end simulation pipeline (SPADE-21cm) to assess the impact of antenna positional displacements on lunar 21-cm signal measurements by the DEX satellite array. It finds that both lateral and vertical offsets cause significant biases in power spectra, with stricter tolerances required for vertical displacements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of antenna displacement on the lunar surface which could distort 21-cm signal measurements, necessitating understanding of allowable positional inaccuracies for accurate cosmological studies.

Method: Developed SPADE-21cm pipeline integrating lunar topography, sky models, and 21-cm signal simulations. Analyzed power spectrum biases across 7-12 MHz and 30-35 MHz bands for lateral/vertical offsets using statistical thresholds.

Result: Positional offsets induce 10-30% power spectrum bias. Lateral offsets under σ_xy/λ ≈0.027 (32.5 MHz) affect <1% of modes at high contamination, while vertical offsets impact larger fractions. Thresholds apply to k_parallel >0.5 h cMpc⁻¹ and specific k_perp ranges.

Conclusion: Stricter vertical displacement controls are essential for DEX mission success. Lunar surface irregularities must be accounted for in antenna deployment planning to preserve DA signal fidelity.

Abstract: The Dark Ages (DA) provides a crucial window into the physics of the infant Universe, with the 21-cm signal offering the only direct probe for mapping out the three-dimensional distribution of matter at this epoch. To measure this cosmological signal, the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) has been proposed as a compact, grid-based radio array on the lunar farside. The minimal design consists of a 32 $\times$ 32 array of 3-m dipole antennas, operating in the $7 - 50$ MHz band. A practical challenge on the lunar surface is that the antennas may get displaced from their intended positions due to deployment imprecisions and non-coplanarity arising from local surface undulations. We present, for the first time, an end-to-end simulation pipeline, called SPADE-21cm, that integrates a sky model with a DA 21-cm signal model simulated in the lunar frame and incorporating lunar topography data. We study the effects of both lateral (xy) and vertical (z) offsets on the two-dimensional power spectra across the $7 - 12$ MHz and $30 - 35$ MHz spectral windows, with tolerance thresholds derived only for the latter. Our results show that positional offsets bias the power spectrum by $10 - 30$ per cent relative to the expected 21-cm power spectrum during DA. Lateral offsets within $σ_{xy}/λ\lesssim 0.027$ (at 32.5 MHz) keep the fraction of Fourier modes with strong contamination (> 50 per cent of the signal) to less than 1 per cent, whereas vertical height offsets affect a larger fraction. This conclusion holds for the 21-cm window with $k_\parallel > 0.5$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$ over the range of $k_\perp = 0.003 - 0.009$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$.

Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for the cosmological production of keV - GeV mass dark matter that interacts with the Standard Model through a small effective magnetic dipole moment. Such an interaction can be radiatively generated if dark matter couples to heavier charged particles. Previous studies have focused on the case where these charged states are much heavier than the reheat temperature, such that freeze-in production of dark matter is sensitive to the ultraviolet details of reheating. Here, we instead consider the possibility that these heavy states have masses comparable to the dark matter mass and are charged under a new kinetically-mixed $U(1)'$. As a result, dark matter production is dominated by the infrared freeze-in of the heavy charged states that subsequently thermalize the rest of the dark sector to a temperature much below that of the visible bath. We delineate regions of parameter space consistent with cosmological and astrophysical constraints and identify benchmark scenarios that can guide the next generation of direct detection experiments searching for spin-dependent scattering of sub-GeV dark matter.

We find that the neutrino effect is sizable compared to the current experimental sensitivity and can also significantly affect the value of the Weinberg angle measured in atomic systems. This offers a promising method for detecting the neutrino force in the future and facilitates the application of precision atomic physics as a probe for neutrino physics and the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective method for observing CP violation effects in meson decays, surpassing the limitations of conventional asymmetry measurements and providing deeper insights into quantum properties of the systems.

Method: The authors reconstruct density matrices for decay processes and compute their differences using trace distance. They apply this to neutral kaons decaying into pion triplets and B/D-mesons decaying into SU(3) octets, extending the approach to spin-1 states via helicity density matrices.

Result: The method achieves CP violation significance comparable to or greater than traditional asymmetry approaches. It allows analysis of quantum properties like entanglement and nonlocality in these systems.

Conclusion: Density matrix analysis with trace distance offers a superior framework for detecting CP violation and studying quantum characteristics of meson decays compared to conventional techniques.

Abstract: We investigate direct CP violation in neutral meson decays by reconstructing the associated density matrices and measuring their difference using the trace distance. Our results cover neutral kaon decays into two scalar triplets of isospin space, specifically the pions, and decays of $B$- and $D$- mesons into two scalar octets of SU(3) flavor space. We briefly discuss the quantum properties of these states, including entanglement, contextuality, and nonlocality. Additionally, we demonstrate a comparable approach for spin-1 final states by employing a density matrix describing states in the space of helicities. The significance of CP violation obtained through this method is consistently comparable, and often surpasses that obtained using only single, or combinations of, asymmetries.

Motivation: To achieve higher precision in theoretical predictions for B-meson decay observables, addressing limitations from lower-order calculations and improving constraints on the CKM unitarity triangle.

Method: Calculated three-loop QCD corrections using current-current and penguin operators, reduced integrals to master integrals with mass ratio expansions, and employed semi-analytic methods for semi-numerical evaluation.

Result: Numerical predictions including ΔΓ_s = 0.078 ± 0.015 ps⁻¹, a_fs^s = 2.27 ± 0.13 ×10⁻⁵, and ΔΓ_d = 0.00215 ± 0.00013 ps⁻¹, with precise ratios ΔΓ_s/ΔM_s and ΔΓ_d/ΔΓ_s aiding CKM analysis.

Conclusion: The results provide improved precision for B-meson decay parameters, offering stronger tests of the Standard Model and insights into CKM matrix elements, with readiness for future data updates.

Abstract: We compute next-to-next-to-leading order corrections to the decay width difference of mass eigenstates and the charge-parity (CP) asymmetry $a_{\rm fs}$ in flavour-specific decays of neutral $B$ mesons. We include both current-current and penguin operators at three-loop order. All input integrals in the transition amplitude are reduced to a small set of master integrals which depend on the ratio of the charm and bottom quark masses. The latter are computed using semi-analytic methods which provide deep expansions around properly selected values of $m_c/m_b$. We provide numerical results for $ΔΓ$ and $ΔΓ/ΔM$, both for the $B_d$ and $B_s$ system, including a detailed uncertainty analysis. Using the experimental value for the mass difference $ΔM_s$ we predict $ΔΓ_s=(0.078 \pm 0.015) ~\mbox{ps}^{-1}$. For the CP asymmetries we find $ a_{\rm fs}^s = (2.27 \pm 0.13 ) \times 10^{-5}$ and $a_{\rm fs}^d = -(5.19 \pm 0.30)~\times~10^{-4}$. Furthermore, we show that the ratios $(ΔΓ_s/ΔM_s) / (ΔΓ_d/ΔM_d)$ and $ΔΓ_d / ΔΓ_s$ can be predicted with high precision. The former quantity permits the prediction $ΔΓ_d=(0.00215\pm 0.00013)~\mbox{ps}^{-1}$ from the measurements of $ΔM_{d,s}$ and $ΔΓ_s$. We further discuss the impact of $ΔΓ_d/ΔΓ_s$ on the CKM unitarity triangle and present ready-to-use formulae which permit improved predictions once updated results for the operator matrix elements are available.

Abstract: Inverse beta decay (IBD), $\overlineν_e p \to e^+ n \left( γ\right)$, is the main detection channel for reactor antineutrinos in water- and hydrocarbon-based detectors. As reactor antineutrino experiments now target sub-percent-level sensitivity to oscillation parameters, a precise theoretical description of IBD, including recoil, weak magnetism, nucleon structure, and radiative corrections, becomes essential. In this work, we give a detailed and precise calculation of the total and differential cross sections for radiative IBD, $\overlineν_e p \to e^+ n γ$. We use a heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory framework, systematically incorporating electroweak, electromagnetic, and strong-interaction corrections. We derive new analytic cross-section expressions, clarify the collinear structure of radiative corrections, and provide a systematic uncertainty analysis. We also discuss phenomenological applications for reactor antineutrino experiments, e.g., JUNO, and neutron decay. Our results enable sub-permille theoretical precision, supporting current and future experiments.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates electromagnetic radiative corrections in inverse beta decay for reactor antineutrino energies using chiral perturbation theory, providing precise cross-section predictions and an error budget. It includes QED, QCD, and electroweak contributions, improving accuracy for neutrino oscillation studies and new physics searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve higher precision in reactor antineutrino flux normalization and neutrino oscillation parameter measurements by accounting for previously unincorporated radiative corrections at the permille level.

Method: Heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory was employed to compute radiative corrections in the inverse beta decay process. The method systematically includes quantum electrodynamics, chromodynamics, and electroweak contributions, and derives the positron energy spectrum.

Result: The study provides the most accurate cross-section predictions with a comprehensive error budget. It shows that radiative corrections at the permille level significantly improve flux normalization and enable precise oscillation parameter determinations.

Conclusion: The improved calculations allow better reactor antineutrino flux normalization, enhancing neutrino oscillation analyses and enabling sensitive searches for physics beyond the Standard Model at nuclear reactors.

Abstract: We compute electromagnetic radiative corrections in the inverse beta decay, $\barν_e + p \rightarrow e^+ + n$, at reactor antineutrino energies within the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, provide the most accurate cross-section predictions for this process, and present a complete error budget. For the first time, we consistently include quantum electrodynamics, chromodynamics, and electroweak contributions and present the positron energy spectrum accounting for radiative corrections. Our calculation also improves on previous evaluations by incorporating permille-level contributions. The results can be readily applied to normalize the reactor antineutrino flux, make precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters, and search for new physics at nuclear power plants.

### [60] [Quadrupole spectra derived from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb identified-hadron $\bf v_2(p_t)$ data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08003)
*Thomas A. Trainor*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the algebraic structure of $v_2(p_t)$, a measure of elliptic flow in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions, and concludes that the assumption of a single dominant particle source is invalid. Instead, it suggests that the observed quadrupole structure stems from a novel QCD process unrelated to hydrodynamic descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically assess the assumption that all produced particles originate from a single source in heavy-ion collisions and to investigate the underlying mechanism of elliptic flow through algebraic analysis.

Method: Developed a procedure to determine a common monopole boost and quadrupole $p_t$ spectra for multiple hadron species, applied to data from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions.

Result: Found that the single-source assumption is unjustified; quadrupole structure variations across hadron species indicate a new QCD process independent of hydrodynamics.

Conclusion: The observed elliptic flow cannot be fully explained by hydrodynamic models and instead points to an alternative QCD process distinct from known interactions like jet production.

Abstract: $p_t$-differential quantity $v_2(p_t)$ is meant to measure elliptic flow manifested by a dense QCD medium formed in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. Elliptic flow may be referred to more neutrally as a cylindrical quadrupole component of the transverse motion of particle sources within a collision. As defined, $v_2(p_t)$ relies on an implicit assumption that almost all produced particles emerge from a single source. This article describes a detailed study of the algebraic structure of $v_2(p_t)$. A procedure is developed to derive a common monopole boost (radial flow) value and quadrupole $p_t$ spectra for several hadron species. The method is applied to $v_2(p_t)$ data for three hadron species from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions. According to available $v_2(p_t)$ data the assumption of a single dominant particle source within A-A collisions is unjustified. Combined with a previous study of quadrupole amplitude variation for 200 GeV $p$-$p$ collisions these results demonstrate that quadrupole structure is related to a novel QCD process separate from projectile-nucleon dissociation and jet production. Given quadrupole evolution it is unlikely that a hydrodynamic description is relevant to that process.

*Xiaojian Du,Sören Schlichting,Jie Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper extends the KoMPoST framework to 3+1D, incorporating non-boost-invariant dynamics and longitudinal structure modeling for improved accuracy in heavy-ion collision simulations, and evaluates its impact on observables like anisotropic flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce uncertainties in heavy-ion collision studies caused by early-time dynamics, particularly the limitations of existing boost-invariant models in capturing longitudinal structures.

Method: The method involves extending KoMPoST to 3+1D using kinetic theory-based response functions for non-boost-invariant fluctuations. They compare the shear-stress tensor from KoMPoST-3D with Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics and simulate collisions using a comprehensive framework (McDIPPER+KoMPoST-3D+CLVisc+SMASH).

Result: The results show the importance of non-boost-invariant dynamics in accurately modeling longitudinal structures, with observables like anisotropic flow sensitively dependent on hydrodynamic initialization time.

Conclusion: The extended framework improves accuracy in simulating heavy-ion collisions, emphasizing the need for 3+1D approaches and careful consideration of initialization parameters in early-time dynamics modeling.

Abstract: So far a major source of uncertainty in the study of heavy-ion collisions arises from the early time dynamics which includes initial state and pre-equilibrium dynamics. The state-of-the-art framework, KoMPoST, employs non-equilibrium Green's functions to propagate the initial energy-momentum tensor to the hydrodynamic phase, yet currently only treats transverse plane dynamics under boost-invariant conditions. In this work, we extend KoMPoST to include non-boost-invariant responses to initial conditions, essential for accurately capturing the longitudinal structures observed in heavy-ion collisions. Non-boost-invariant fluctuations on top of a homogeneous background are evolved using (3+1)D response functions calculated in kinetic theory. To assess kinetic theory's transition towards hydrodynamic evolution, we systematically compare the out-of-equilibrium shear-stress tensor from KoMPoST-3D with estimates based on Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. Subsequently, a comprehensive (3+1)D framework, McDIPPER+KoMPoST-3D+CLVisc+SMASH, is utilized to simulate the complete spacetime evolution of heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of key observables, including longitudinal structure of anisotropic flow, to variations in the hydrodynamic initialization time is thoroughly investigated.

Abstract: The monopoles play important roles in physics. In this work we discuss the new monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories, the standard model, the Georgi-Glashow model, and QCD. The standard model has two totally different types of monopoles, the Cho-Maison type monopoles which have the weak boson dressing and the electromagnetically neutral magnetic monopoles (the naked one and the one with the W boson dressing) which carries the neutral magnetic charge $4π/\bae$. The Georgi-Glashow model has a new monopole, the Wu-Yang monopole which has the W boson dressing, in addition to the well known 'tHooft-Polyakov monopole. And QCD has a new monopole, the Wu-Yang monopole which has the chromon dressing. We show how to construct the new monopoles and clarify the origin of the topology of the new monopoles. The new monopoles could have deep implications not just in high energy physics but also in low energy physics.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework for nucleon structure analysis, incorporating Fock sectors from $|qqqangle$ to $|qqqqar{q}angle$, enabling detailed studies of quark and gluon contributions to nucleon observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a first-principles, fully relativistic, and nonperturbative approach to QCD to better understand nucleon structure, including gluonic contributions and spin observables.

Method: BLFQ framework with expanding Fock sectors ($|qqqangle$, $|qqqgangle$, up to $|qqqqar{q}angle$) and effective light-front Hamiltonians without explicit confinement potentials.

Result: Successful description of nucleon observables, calculation of nucleon wavefunctions as QCD Hamiltonian eigenstates, and qualitative agreement with experimental data on quark/gluon distributions and spin contributions.

Conclusion: BLFQ is a promising tool for achieving QCD-based, first-principles predictions of nucleon structure, advancing toward realistic calculations without auxiliary models.

Abstract: We review recent advancements in understanding nucleon structure within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework--a fully relativistic, nonperturbative approach to solving quantum field theories. In its initial phase, we start with the leading Fock sector $|qqq\rangle$ and an effective light-front Hamiltonian incorporating confinement and one-gluon exchange within which BLFQ can already successfully describe key nucleon observables. The framework has since been extended to include the next-to-leading Fock sector $|qqqg\rangle$, enabling studies of gluonic contributions to the nucleon's internal structure, including gluon helicity, orbital angular momentum, and three-dimensional imaging through generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GPDs and TMDs). Most recently, BLFQ has achieved a significant milestone by computing nucleon light-front wavefunctions as eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian without an explicit confining potential. These calculations, including Fock sectors up to $|qqqq\bar{q}\rangle$, further develop the path to first-principles predictions of quark and gluon matter densities, helicity and transversity distributions, and spin observables, showing qualitative agreement with experimental and phenomenological results. Together, these developments highlight BLFQ's growing capacity to provide an increasingly complete and realistic picture of nucleon structure grounded in QCD.

TL;DR: The paper calculates leading-twist gluon transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) at one-loop using large-momentum effective theory, extending the gluon-gluon correlator to a spin-space matrix and revealing non-zero distributions for several gluon TMDPDFs critical for nucleon tomography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable extraction of gluon TMDPDFs via lattice QCD simulations and advance understanding of nucleon structure through complete tomography.

Method: Perturbative calculation within large-momentum effective theory using circular polarization basis, generalizing the gluon correlator to a spin matrix, and incorporating transverse momenta of external states.

Result: Non-zero distributions found for f_{1T}^{⊥g}, h₁⊥g, h₁Tg, and h₁T⊥g TMDPDFs at one-loop level.

Conclusion: Results provide a foundation for lattice QCD studies to fully determine gluon TMDPDFs, contributing to nucleon structure analysis.

Abstract: We present the perturbative calculation of the leading-twist gluon transverse momentum dependent distribution functions (TMDPDFs) at one-loop level within large-momentum effective theory. By employing the basis of circular polarizations, we generalize the gluon-gluon correlator to a matrix $Φ_{ΛΛ^\prime}^{ij}(x,\bm{k}_T^2;S)$ in the gluon $\otimes$ hadron spin space. Incorporating the transverse momentum of external states, we derive the leading-twist gluon TMDPDFs and quasi-TMDPDFs at one-loop level. Our calculations reveal nonzero distributions for the gluon TMDPDFs $f_{1T}^{\perp g}(x,\bm{k}_T^2)$, $h_{1}^{\perp g}(x,\bm{k}_T^2)$, $h_{1T}^{g}(x,\bm{k}_T^2)$, and $h_{1T}^{\perp g}(x,\bm{k}_T^2)$. These findings enable future lattice QCD simulations to extract these gluon TMDPDFs, which will facilitate a complete determination of nucleon tomography.

TL;DR: The paper examines neutrino flavor oscillations using quantum field theory (QFT), focusing on virtual neutrinos and their propagators. It validates the prior method of using only particle contributions from propagators in vacuum oscillations, with implications for applying QFT to external field scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously justify the validity of using only the particle contribution from neutrino propagators in calculating matrix elements, a method previously applied in studying neutrino oscillations in external fields, by first analyzing vacuum oscillations.

Method: The authors use QFT formalism, considering propagators of neutrino mass eigenstates. They analyze neutrino oscillations in vacuum, extending prior work that decomposed propagators and used only particle contributions, to validate the approach's correctness.

Result: The study confirms the validity of using only the particle contribution from neutrino propagators in vacuum oscillations, suggesting this method can be reliably extended to scenarios involving external fields.

Conclusion: The justified method provides a solid foundation for applying QFT to neutrino oscillations in external fields, ensuring accurate calculations through the validated particle contribution approach.

Abstract: We study neutrino flavor oscillations using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT), where neutrinos are taken to be virtual particles. One deals with the propagators of neutrino mass eigenstates in this formalism. Previously, while applying this approach to neutrino oscillations in external fields, we decomposed the propagators and used only the particle contribution in the calculation of the matrix element. In the present work, we carefully justify the validity of this kind of transformation by considering neutrino oscillations in vacuum. In principle, the results obtained can be extended for the QFT applied to neutrino oscillations in external fields.

Abstract: We study factorizable contributions to two-body nonleptonic decays of $B$ mesons using the light-cone sum rule method.

*A. -Z. Dubničková,S. Dubnička,P. Weisenpacher*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the electromagnetic structure of the deuteron using three form factors (G_C, G_M, G_Q) derived from scattering experiments and the Unitary and Analytic model. These form factors are extended to the time-like region to predict total cross sections for e+e- → D bar D interactions, enabling studies of deuteron damped oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the deuteron's electromagnetic properties and predict its behavior in time-like regions for studying damped oscillations.

Method: The authors use experimental data from electron-deuteron scattering to determine form factors A(t), B(t), and T_{20}(t), apply the Unitary and Analytic model to construct deuteron form factors, and analytically continue them to predict cross sections and form factor behaviors.

Result: Theoretical form factors and artificial data with errors are generated, allowing investigation into deuteron damped oscillation patterns.

Conclusion: The methodology successfully extends deuteron form factors to time-like regions, enabling analysis of oscillatory structures critical for deeper insights into nuclear dynamics.

Abstract: The deuteron ``D'' is the simplest nucleus with the spin S=1, therefore its electromagnetic structure is completely described by three different, the charge $G_C(t)$, magnetic $G_M(t)$ and quadrupole $G_Q(t)$ form factors, where $t=-q^2$ is the momentum transfer squared of the electrons or the deuterons in the elastic scattering of electrons on deuterons. All three deuteron form factors are theoretically related to the functions $A(t)$, $B(t)$ and $T_{20}(t)$ to be numerically evaluated with errors, whereby $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ in a measurement of the differential cross section of elastic scattering of unpolarized electrons on unpolarized deuterons, and $T_{20}$ in measurements of the elastic scattering of the longitudinally polarized electrons, respectively also on polarized deuteron target. The obtained data are utilized to fix parameters of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors to be constructed in the form of the Unitary and Analytic model. Afterwards these form factors are analytically continued into the time-like region, with the aim to predict artificial behavior of the total cross section $σ_{tot}(e^+e^- \to D \bar D)(s)$. By means of the latter artificial data with errors on the deuteron ``effective'' electromagnetic form factor are produced theoretically. Finally, such data render a possibility to investigate the deuteron damped oscillation regular structures.

### [68] [Reviving $Z^\prime$ Portal Dark Matter with Conversion Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08515)
*Zhen-Wei Wang,Zhi-Long Han,Fei Huang,Honglei Li,Ang Liu,Lei Wu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: A novel U(1)_{B-L}-gauged model with Dirac dark fermions is proposed to address collider/direct detection challenges, introducing a light dark matter candidate χ₁ via mixing with a heavier χ₂. Unique phenomena like coscattering and conversion arise from their compressed mass spectrum, suppressed by a small mixing angle, enabling viable scenarios under current constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve tight collider and direct detection constraints faced by conventional Z' portal dark matter models by introducing a new framework with two dark fermions, where their mixing and mass hierarchy alleviate experimental limitations.

Method: The model incorporates a gauged U(1)_{B-L} symmetry with Dirac fermions χ₁ and χ₂, whose mixing via δm term creates a compressed mass spectrum. Key processes studied include coscattering, conversion, and coannihilation. The analysis evaluates production mechanisms in resonance and secluded scenarios, accompanied by thorough constraint checks.

Result: The conversion mechanism benefits from both resonance and secluded frameworks. Despite suppressed interactions, the model satisfies current constraints while offering promising phenomenology for future detection experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a viable solution to existing Z' portal challenges through carefully structured dark sector interactions and mass parameters, highlighting conversion processes as a strong candidate for experimental verification.

Abstract: In many new physics models with extended gauge symmetry, the new gauge boson $Z'$ could mediate the interactions between the dark matter and standard model particles. For the conventional $Z^\prime$ portal dark matter, the collider and the direct detection constraints typically pose a significant challenge. To address this pressing issue, we present in this paper a new benchmark model based on the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which introduces a Dirac dark fermion $\tildeχ_1$ and a heavier partner $\tildeχ_2$ with zero and nonzero $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge, respectively. Including the mass term $δm \bar{\tildeχ}_1\tildeχ_2$ results in the dark fermions $χ_1$ and $χ_2$ in the mass eigenstate, where the lighter one $χ_1$ is regarded as the dark matter candidate. Various intriguing processes for the relic density arise with the compressed mass spectrum $m_{χ_1}\simeq m_{χ_2}$, such as the coscattering $χ_2f\toχ_1f$, the conversion $χ_2χ_i\toχ_1χ_j$, and the coannihilation $χ_1χ_2\to f\bar{f}$ processes. Suppressed by the small mixing angle $θ$ between the dark fermions, the small effective gauge coupling of dark matter $χ_1$ to the gauge boson $Z'$ is one distinct feature of this model, rendering phenomenology in many aspects more promising. In this paper, we investigate the production of dark matter through new mechanisms within the frameworks of resonance and secluded scenarios. The impacts of phenomenological constraints from collider, dark matter, and cosmology are also taken into account. We report that the conversion mechanism is both favored by the resonance and secluded scenarios under current constraints.

### [69] [On the existence of bound states in SIMP dark sectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08517)
*Xiaoyong Chu,Josef Pradler,Daris Samart*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the existence of a scalar isosinglet bound state in SIMP scenarios by solving an Lippmann--Schwinger equation, crucial for accurate dark matter relic abundance calculations with catalyzed freeze-out mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies showed shallow two-pion bound states significantly impact SIMP freeze-out dynamics, but their actual formation was unproven. The paper aims to confirm their existence and quantify parameters affecting bound-state-assisted annihilation rates.

Method: The authors solve an on-shell Lippmann--Schwinger equation in a chiral-unitary framework, analyze the $S$-wave $ππ$ amplitude in the complex energy plane, determine $m_π/f_π$ parameter ranges for bound-state poles, extract residues, and compute the bound-state wave function at origin $|Ψ(0)|$. They compare results with variational finite-range potential estimates.

Result: A scalar isosinglet bound state exists within specific $m_π/f_π$ ranges. Bound-state wave function values like $|Ψ(0)|\sim 0.1\,m_π^{3/2}$ for energies $E_B \sim m_π/20$ match previous phenomenological assumptions, validating prior freeze-out calculations. Comparisons with variational methods show agreement within order-one factors for shallow binding.

Conclusion: The study confirms the necessity of including bound-state effects in SIMP freeze-out calculations, validates earlier parametric assumptions, and demonstrates that shallow $ππ$ bound states are dynamically significant for dark matter relic abundance determination.

Abstract: In strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) scenarios, dark matter is comprised of stable dark pions whose $3\to 2$ or $4\to 2$ reactions set the dark matter relic abundance. Recent work has shown that shallow two-pion bound states significantly affect the freeze-out, but did not establish whether such states actually form. In this work we demonstrate that a scalar isosinglet bound state does exist in a well-defined region of parameter space by solving an on-shell Lippmann--Schwinger equation in a chiral-unitary framework and analyzing the $S$-wave $ππ$ amplitude in the complex energy plane. We determine the range of $m_π/f_π$ for which a pole appears below the two-pion threshold, extract the corresponding residue, and, in the non-relativistic limit, obtain the bound-state wave function at the origin, $|Ψ(0)|$, which controls bound-state-assisted annihilation and decay rates relevant for catalyzed freeze-out. Comparing this T-matrix based result with variational estimates using simple finite-range potentials, we find agreement within order-one factors for shallow binding. For binding energies of order the freeze-out temperature, $E_B \sim m_π/20$, we obtain $|Ψ(0)|\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)\,m_π^{3/2}$, thereby supporting the parametric assumptions used in previous phenomenological analyses.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: KM3Net detected a ~100 PeV neutrino, initiating ultra-high-energy neutrino astronomy and enabling LIV tests. The paper improves upon prior analyses by providing a unified framework for superluminal LIV scenarios, addressing shortcomings in decay calculations and cosmological effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Correct previous analyses' inaccuracies (e.g., oversimplified survival probabilities, incorrect decay-width expressions) and provide a consistent method for evaluating Lorentz Invariance Violation in both energy-independent and quadratic superluminal cases.

Method: Develop a unified framework incorporating accurate decay-width expressions, flavor dependence, cosmological propagation, and cascade regeneration effects assessment. Test scenarios n=0 and n=2 superluminal cases while addressing prior omissions like redshift and threshold effects.

Result: Cascade effects are negligible for LIV bound setting. Survival-probability approximation is validated, though future analyses must consider time-delay signatures for completeness.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a coherent basis for future superluminal neutrino-LIV studies, correcting past methodological flaws and emphasizing the importance of comprehensive cosmological and decay treatments.

Abstract: The $\sim 100\,$PeV neutrino detected by KM3NeT marks the beginning of ultra-high-energy neutrino astronomy and provides a powerful probe of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). In superluminal scenarios, neutrinos can decay through vacuum $e^-e^+$ pair emission or neutrino splitting. Previous analyses of the KM3-230213A event relied on simplified survival-probability estimates and, in some cases, used inaccurate decay-width expressions or neglected redshift and threshold effects. In this work we present a unified and self-consistent framework that corrects these issues and applies to both the energy-independent ($n=0$) and quadratic ($n=2$) superluminal cases. We collect and recast the decay-width and threshold expressions, clarify their flavor dependence, and include a consistent treatment of cosmological propagation. We also assess the impact of cascade regeneration and show that cascade effects are negligible for the purpose of setting LIV bounds. The survival-probability approximation adopted in previous works is therefore justified, while our framework provides a coherent basis for future analyses of superluminal neutrino constraints, which should consistently include possible time-delay signatures.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the thermal production of dark photons in the early universe, examining their production mechanisms across a wide mass range and deriving cosmological constraints on their parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark photons emerge naturally in gauge extensions of the Standard Model. The study aims to understand their thermal production to set cosmological constraints and compare with other experimental bounds.

Method: Comprehensive analysis using inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Analytical estimates with numerical verification for production rates. Resonant production is emphasized for light dark photons.

Result: For dark photons lighter than ~1 MeV, analytical estimates of freeze-in yield are accurate, showing off-resonance contributions are negligible. For heavier masses, a ratio (4πe/27≈0.14) quantifies on/off-resonance contributions. Cosmological constraints on mass (∼0.1–6 MeV) and kinetic mixing (~10^-12 to 10^-10) are derived.

Conclusion: Cosmological constraints are tightest between 0.1 MeV and 6 MeV, surpassing some stellar cooling/supernova bounds. The work provides a framework to test dark photon models in this mass regime.

Abstract: Dark photons, a generic class of light gauge bosons that interact with the Standard Model (SM) exclusively through kinetic mixing, arise naturally in many gauge extensions of the SM. Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4πe/27\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. Compared with bounds from stellar cooling and supernovae, the cosmological constraints are most stringent in the mass range from 0.1 MeV to 6 MeV, within which kinetic mixing at the level of $10^{-12}\sim10^{-10}$ can be probed.

Result: All scenarios align with current data, predicting Dirac CP phases of 294.6°, 302.3°, and 287.0°, with allowed ranges (281.2-338.7°, 287.0-342.2°, 282.7-297.0°) all within 3σ. This scheme naturally explains lepton mass hierarchy and mixing.

Conclusion: The symmetry-breaking scheme offers a valid theoretical framework for lepton flavor structure, supporting future experimental verification and theory development.

Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments have confirmed that neutrinos are massive particles and lepton flavors are mixed. To explain the observed lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing patterns, flavor symmetry plays a crucial and unique role. In this paper, we propose a useful symmetry-breaking scheme by applying $S_{3L} \times S_{3R} \rightarrow S_{2L} \times S_{2R} \rightarrow \emptyset$ within both charged-lepton and neutrino sectors at the mass-matrix level. For the three distinct residual subgroups $S_{2L}^{(23)} \times S_{2R}^{(23)}$, $S_{2L}^{(13)} \times S_{2R}^{(13)}$ and $S_{2L}^{(12)} \times S_{2R}^{(12)}$ under consideration, we systematically analyze the various parameterizations of the lepton mass matrices. It is shown that all the three scenarios are in good agreement with current neutrino oscillation data. Notably, within the latest best-fit values of neutrino oscillation parameters, the predicted Dirac CP-violating phase $δ$ is calculated to be $294.6^\circ$, $302.3^\circ$ and $287.0^\circ$, respectively. To further assess the viability of the model, a comprehensive numerical analysis is performed by utilizing neutrino oscillation parameters at the $3σ$ level. It is found that the allowed range of $δ$ is $281.2^\circ \rightarrow 338.7^\circ$, $287.0^\circ \rightarrow 342.2^\circ$ and $282.7^\circ \rightarrow 297.0^\circ$, all fall within its $3σ$ range. These results indicate that the proposed symmetry-breaking scheme $S_{3L} \times S_{3R} \rightarrow S_{2L} \times S_{2R} \rightarrow \emptyset$ can naturally explain the realistic lepton mass hierarchy and mixing pattern, thereby providing valuable theoretical perspectives for future research.

Abstract: We extract the non-perturbative Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) parameters from the inclusive semi-leptonic decay $Λ_c^+ \to X e^+ ν_e$. Unlike charmed mesons produced near threshold, $Λ_c^+$ baryons produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilation exhibit a complex momentum distribution, making the transformation of the electron energy spectrum from the laboratory frame to the $Λ_c^+$ rest frame non-trivial. To address this, we develop a novel Bayesian inference method to reconstruct the electron energy moments in the $Λ_c^+$ rest frame. By performing a global fit of theoretical predictions in the 1S mass scheme to these extracted moments, we determine the HQET parameters $μ_π^2(Λ_c^+)$ and $ρ_D^3(Λ_c^+)$ for the first time using a purely data-driven approach.

### [74] [Removal of the Tachyons from the Fermionic Sector of the Quadratic ZX Action for the Exotic Model (E8)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08561)
*John Anthony Dixon*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an updated version of the Exotic Model (XM) that addresses the inherent issues in the Supersymmetric Standard Model's (SSM) SUSY breaking mechanism by introducing an Exotic Invariant. This avoids the need for spontaneous symmetry breaking and resolves associated problems. The current work (E8 in a series) demonstrates a method to eliminate tachyonic excitations in the fermionic sector by ensuring equal masses for all four fermion fields in the ZX sector, validated via a Mathematica notebook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SSM's reliance on spontaneous SUSY breaking has serious unresolved issues. The XM, using an Exotic Invariant derived from SSM and SUSY BRS cohomology, offers an alternative SUSY splitting mechanism without spontaneous breaking, addressing these problems.

Method: The XM modifies the SUSY algebra through the Exotic Invariant. E8's specific contribution is a systematic removal of tachyons at tree level in the fermionic ZX sector by imposing identical masses across its four fermions, using a computational proof in Mathematica.

Result: Successfully eliminates tachyonic states in the fermionic ZX sector by equalizing the mass of four fermion fields. This ensures a viable starting point for further XM analysis compared to problematic spontaneous SUSY breaking approaches.

Conclusion: The XM's fermionic sector is now free of tachyons at tree level, a necessary step toward validating it as a superior alternative to the SSM. Future work includes extending tachyon removal to bosonic sectors and deeper exploration of the model's viability.

Abstract: This paper contains an encouraging result for the development of the Exotic Model (the `XM'). The XM is made from the Supersymmetric Standard Model (the `SSM') by coupling it to the `Exotic Invariant'. This rather unique `Exotic Invariant' is suggested by the detailed form of the SSM, combined with the detailed form of the BRS cohomology of SUSY.
  The motivation for examining the XM is that the usual SSM has some well-known, and serious, problems in its generally accepted, but unsatisfactory, SUSY breaking mechanism. That mechanism is based on the spontaneous breaking of SUSY.
  The Exotic Model avoids all of these problems, easily, because its SUSY splitting mechanism does not use, or need, any kind of spontaneous breaking of SUSY. The XM contains a mechanism for SUSY mass splitting because the addition of the Exotic Invariant modifies the algebra of SUSY. This paper is E8 in a series of papers denoted En, n= 1,2, ... all devoted to the XM. There is a lot of work still required to elucidate how the XM functions, and to see if the XM is really a viable alternative to the SSM. The first crucial question, raised in E7, is whether it is possible to constrain the initial XM action, so that the result excludes tachyonic excitations at tree level. If the XM is to be a viable theory, it is essential to first remove the tachyonic excitations, in a sensible way, from the fermionic and the bosonic sectors of the quadratic ZX action.
  This paper E8 explains how to remove the tachyons from the basic fermionic `ZX sector' at tree level. There are four fermion fields in this ZX sector. The removal requires that all of these fields have the same mass. This result is shown using a Mathematica notebook, which is issued with this paper.

### [75] [New dark matter production mechanism and the gravitational wave signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08616)
*Fa Peng Huang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores non-thermal mechanisms for dark matter production involving pNGBs, Q-balls, and filtered DM from early-universe phenomena like PBH evaporation, predicting detectable gravitational wave signals for future observatories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved microscopic origins of dark matter and explore alternatives to the thermal freeze-out paradigm, which has been the traditional focus.

Method: Examines novel production channels (pNGBs, Q-balls, filtered DM) via early-universe processes (PBH evaporation, superradiance, phase transitions) and links them to predicted gravitational wave signatures.

Result: Shows these mechanisms can produce gravitational wave signals detectable by upcoming observatories, enabling multi-messenger probes of DM's origin.

Conclusion: Non-thermal production scenarios paired with gravitational wave astronomy provide a new avenue to explore dark matter beyond conventional models.

Abstract: The microscopic origin and production mechanism of dark matter (DM) remain central questions in cosmology and particle physics. While thermal freeze-out has long dominated DM model building, alternative non-thermal scenarios are gaining prominence. In this work, we explore novel production channels for heavy DM candidates, including pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), Q-balls, and filtered DM arising from early-universe phenomena such as primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation, superradiance, and first-order phase transitions. We demonstrate that these mechanisms naturally generate gravitational wave signals detectable by future observatories, such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji, and Cosmic Explorer. This multi-messenger approach offers a promising pathway to probe the origin and nature of DM beyond conventional paradigms.

### [76] [Freeze-in Production of Non-Abelian Millicharged Vector Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08622)
*Van Que Tran,Tzu-Chiang Yuan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel model of vector freeze-in dark matter using a hidden non-Abelian gauge sector spontaneously broken to a residual U(1), with interactions mediated through a dark photon. This model naturally incorporates millicharged dark matter particles and successfully predicts the observed dark matter density within astrophysical constraints, offering a testable framework for future direct detection experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of traditional freeze-in mechanisms and non-thermal dark matter production while incorporating non-Abelian symmetries, long-range interactions via the dark photon, and compatibility with existing observational and experimental constraints.

Method: The authors construct a model with a hidden SU(N) gauge group broken to U(1), introducing a dark photon and vector dark matter particles. They use a dimension-five kinetic mixing operator to generate small millicharges (ε ~10^-7) and solve the Boltzmann equations with two-temperature plasma evolution, including plasmon decay effects to compute relic abundance.

Result: They find parameter regions (ε and g_D ~10^-7) that reproduce the observed dark matter density while avoiding overproduction and satisfying constraints from astrophysical observations. This establishes a viable non-Abelian vector freeze-in scenario.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates how non-Abelian dynamics can underpin freeze-in dark matter with detectable millicharges, providing a testable framework for sub-GeV direct detection experiments and potential explanations for dark sector phenomenology beyond minimal models.

Abstract: We present the first predictive realization of vector freeze-in dark matter from a hidden non-Abelian gauge sector, spontaneously broken to a residual $U(1)$ with a massless dark photon mediator. A massive dark vector particle-antiparticle pair acquires small millicharges via a dimension-five kinetic mixing operator that induces a dimension-four mixing term with effective coefficient $ε$, and interacts through the hidden gauge coupling $g_D$, linking it weakly to the Standard Model. Solving the relic abundance with a two-temperature Boltzmann evolution including plasmon decays, we find that $ε, g_D \sim 10^{-7}$ reproduce the observed density while satisfying astrophysical and cosmological bounds. This minimal framework links non-Abelian vector dynamics, long-range dark forces, and dark matter, and can be testable with upcoming sub-GeV dark matter direct-detection experiments.

*Jianing Qin,Fei Huang,Honglei Li,Zhi-Long Han,Jin Sun*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes collider signatures of a U(1)_{Lμ−Lτ} model with a Z' boson and scalar triplets, focusing on four-lepton final states at multi-TeV colliders. It highlights sensitivity of observables to Z' mass and coupling parameters, and the role of beam polarization in background suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the experimental signatures of the U(1)_{Lμ−Lτ} model, particularly lepton flavor violation in μ-τ sector, and assess the feasibility of detecting such signals at future lepton colliders.

Method: Detailed analysis of cross sections, asymmetries, and polarization effects in four-lepton final states using collider simulations. Parameters studied include Z' mass, couplings (|tilde{g}/m_{Z'}|), and triplet Yukawa interactions.

Result: Signal cross sections are highly sensitive to m_{Z'} and |tilde{g}/m_{Z'}| but not significantly affected by Yukawa couplings. Forward-backward asymmetry shows monotonic dependence on m_{Z'}, and beam polarization effectively reduces SM backgrounds while enhancing signals.

Conclusion: Multi-lepton channels provide powerful probes for testing the U(1)_{Lμ−Lτ} model. The results guide future experimental searches at muon and electron-positron colliders by clarifying parameter sensitivity and optimization strategies.

Abstract: We investigate the collider signatures of the maximally flavor-violating $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ model, where a new gauge boson $Z^\prime$ and scalar triplets induce lepton flavor-changing interactions in the $μ$-$τ$ sector. Focusing on four-lepton final states at multi-TeV lepton colliders, we conduct a detailed analysis of cross sections, asymmetries, and polarization effects. We show that the signal cross section is highly sensitive to $m_{Z^\prime}$ and the effective parameters $\tilde{g}/m_{Z^\prime}$, while remaining largely insensitive to the triplet Yukawa couplings within the phenomenologically allowed region. The forward-backward asymmetry exhibits a characteristic monotonic dependence on $m_{Z^\prime}$, and beam polarization can significantly suppress Standard Model backgrounds while enhancing new physics contributions. We find that over the phenomenologically allowed parameter space, the predicted observables remain highly sensitive to the underlying model parameters. These results demonstrate that multi-lepton final states are powerful probes of the $U(1)_{Lμ- L_τ}$ framework and offer valuable guidance for future searches at muon and electron-positron colliders.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates doubly-charmed pentaquarks' mass spectra, structures, and decays using a quark model approach, predicting compact states and narrow resonances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the properties of doubly-charmed pentaquarks following the discovery of Ξ^{++}_{cc}(3621) and T^{+}_{cc}(3875), providing theoretical guidance for future experiments.

Method: Treats two light quarks as a diquark, reducing the system to four bodies. Uses constituent quark model and Gaussian expansion method for mass spectra, calculates root-mean-square radii, and applies quark-interchange model for decay widths.

Result: Predicted mass spectra between 4.7-5.4 GeV, compact radii (1.1-1.6 fm), and all states decaying into singly-charmed baryon-meson pairs with some widths <10 MeV.

Conclusion: Identified narrow resonances offering guidance for experimental searches and further theoretical studies on doubly-charmed pentaquarks.

Abstract: Building upon the discoveries of the $Ξ^{++}_{cc}(3621)$ and $T^{+}_{cc}(3875)$, we undertake a comprehensive investigation into the mass spectra, internal structures, and decay properties of doubly-charmed pentaquarks. By treating the two light quarks as a tightly bound diquark, the five-body system reduces to a four-body heavy quark-heavy quark-diquark-antiquark configuration. Within the constituent quark model framework, we calculate their mass spectra in the range of 4.7-5.4 GeV and corresponding internal mass contributions via the Gaussian expansion method. The root-mean-square radii, typically between 1.1-1.6 fm, indicate compact spatial structures. Furthermore, we also calculate the rearrangement decay widths via the quark-interchange model, finding that all states are unstable and decay into a singly-charmed baryon and a singly-charmed meson. Several narrow resonances have been identified, some of which have a total width even below 10 MeV. We hope that our study could provide valuable guidance for future theoretical investigations and experimental searches targeting doubly-charmed pentaquarks.

Abstract: The quality of recent SRC/CT Collaboration $J/ψ$ photoproduction data off a $^4$He target from Hall~D at Jefferson Laboratory, combined with the feasibility of measuring the reaction close to the free-nucleon energy threshold, opens the door to using incoherent $J/ψ$ photoproduction to access a variety of interesting physics aspects. An example is an estimate of the $J/ψ~p$ scattering length $|α_{J/ψ~p}|$ on the bound proton obtained using the Vector Meson Dominance model. This value can be compared with that of the free proton from the GlueX Collaboration. One may then project what would be expected from the SRC/CT Collaboration Experiment E12--25--002, which was recently approved by the JLab PAC. Using a plane-wave theoretical model to generate quasi-data, we find the experiment could achieve a result of $|α_{J/ψ~p}| = 3.08\pm 0.45~\mathrm{mfm}$, an uncertainty competitive with that of the free-proton measurement. A comparison between the two would allow an evaluation of the effects of medium modification in the case of light nuclei.

*T. E. Bikbaev,M. Yu. Khlopov,A. G. Mayorov*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel numerical method to study the stability of composite dark atoms ($XHe$) by addressing the $XHe$-nucleus interaction problem, which helps explain anomalies in direct detection experiments like DAMA/LIBRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the instability issue of $XHe$ dark atoms caused by unshielded nuclear attraction during interactions with atomic nuclei, which complicates direct dark matter detection experiments.

Method: A self-consistent numerical quantum mechanical approach is developed to model electromagnetic-nuclear couplings in the $XHe$-nucleus three-body system, reconstructing an effective potential that includes dipole Coulomb barriers and potential wells.

Result: The method demonstrates how $XHe$-nucleus bound states form and influence low-energy capture processes, providing a framework to interpret experimental anomalies such as annual modulation signals observed in DAMA/LIBRA.

Conclusion: The proposed model validates the dark atom hypothesis, strengthens theoretical foundations for dark matter interactions, and offers guidance for future experimental designs in dark matter detection.

Abstract: The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms offers a compelling framework to address the challenges in direct dark matter particles detection, as their neutral, atom-like configuration evades conventional experimental signatures. A critical issue may arise in interaction between $XHe$ and atomic nuclei due to the unshielded nuclear attraction, which could destabilize the dark atom's bound state. To resolve this, we propose a novel numerical quantum mechanical approach that accounts for self-consistent electromagnetic-nuclear couplings. This method addresses to eliminate the inherent complexity of the $XHe$-nucleus three-body system, where analytical solutions are intractable. By reconstructing the effective interaction potential - including dipole Coulomb barrier and shallow potential well - we demonstrate how these features lead to the formation of $XHe$-nucleus bound states and modulate low-energy capture processes. Our model enables validation of the dark atom hypothesis, particularly in interpreting experimental anomalies like annual modulation signals observed in DAMA/LIBRA. These findings advance the theoretical foundation for dark matter interactions and provide a robust framework for future experimental design.

*Giorgio Arcadi,Abdelhak Djouadi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores explaining LHC data excesses via a two-Higgs-doublet model with an additional light pseudoscalar Higgs boson, which can account for observed diphoton resonances and a toponium candidate while remaining compatible with experimental constraints and dark matter requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unconfirmed LHC excesses (diphoton resonances at 95, 152, 650 GeV and a 350 GeV toponium) without overstepping significance thresholds, and provide a viable DM explanation within constrained extensions of the Standard Model.

Method: Analyzing a 2HDM + light pseudoscalar 'a' model, updating experimental constraints (dark matter, Higgs searches, precision measurements), and demonstrating how adjusted Higgs state masses/couplings explain each excess individually while satisfying existing constraints.

Result: The model successfully accounts for all mentioned LHC excesses when parameters are appropriately tuned, remaining consistent with experimental/theoretical limits and offering a dark matter candidate.

Conclusion: A 2HDM with a light pseudoscalar is a promising framework to reconcile LHC anomalies and暗 matter, though further data is needed to confirm parameter predictions.

Abstract: There are several excesses of events in current LHC data, yet not exceeding the level of significance which would make them to be considered as firm. They point to the possibility of the presence of a new Higgs particle in the spectrum, in addition to the already observed 125 GeV state. In particular, there are excesses involving a diphoton resonance at invariant masses of about 95 GeV, 152 GeV and 650 GeV and an extra scalar might accompany the recent observation of a toponium at a mass of about 350 GeV. Several interpretations of these excesses have been attempted in extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper, we aim to explain them in the framework of a two Higgs doublet model supplemented by a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs boson $a$ which would correspond to the putative resonance in most cases. This realistic 2HD+a scenario is attractive as it is has the virtue to pass all experimental constraints from high-precision experiments and collider searches and, at the same time, to allow for a viable explanation of the dark matter in the universe. We first update the present constraints on the model, in particular taking into account the latest results on dark matter and Higgs searches, as well the high-precision measurements, including those from Higgs and flavor physics. We then show that the additional Higgs states with the proper mass spectrum and adjusted couplings to fermions, would explain all the LHC excesses (but individually) while passing the former experimental constraints as well as the theoretical ones.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for renormalizing general bosonic effective field theories beyond one loop, calculating renormalization group equations up to two loops and dimension six. It applies to theories with arbitrary gauge symmetry and scalar content, and reproduces known SMEFT results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a comprehensive method for renormalizing higher-dimensional operators in quantum field theories, crucial for phenomenological studies and understanding critical phenomena. Previous methods were limited to one loop or specific cases, necessitating a more general approach.

Method: The authors developed a general framework for bosonic effective field theories beyond one loop, calculating renormalization group equations up to two loops. They utilized arbitrary gauge symmetry and scalar field content. Specialization to SMEFT via replacement rules validated their approach against existing literature.

Result: The framework successfully reproduces recent SMEFT results and offers broad applicability for anomalous dimension calculations in extensions of SMEFT and other theories. It also provides data on scaling dimensions for conformal field theories without fermions.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient renormalization across diverse theories, enhancing precision in particle physics analyses and conformal field theory studies. Its general formulation allows adaptation to various models beyond the Standard Model.

Abstract: The renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in quantum field theory is essential for phenomenological analyses in particle physics, and plays a significant role in the study of critical phenomena. We present a framework for renormalizing general bosonic effective field theories beyond one loop, with arbitrary gauge symmetry and scalar field content. In particular, we calculate the renormalization group equations in such theories up to two loops and dimension six. When specialized to the bosonic sector of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) using simple replacement rules, our general expressions reproduce recent results from the literature. Due to the broad applicability of effective field theory, our general results can readily be applied to obtain the anomalous dimensions in extensions of the bosonic SMEFT and in a plethora of other theories. We also envision our results to provide useful data on the scaling dimensions of composite operators in conformal field theories without fermions.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines how new scalar, vector, or axial-vector interactions affecting neutrinos or dark matter (DM) modify the 'neutrino fog' in ton-scale xenon detectors. Using XENONnT data showing solar neutrino interactions, they set tighter bounds on light mediators coupling to DM, impacting DM interaction constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the neutrino fog problem in current DM experiments and assess how new physics interactions (via mediators) alter neutrino and DM signals, ensuring accurate DM detection and exclusion limits.

Method: Analyze XENONnT nuclear-recoil data for solar neutrino interactions, model various mediator couplings (scalar/vector/axial-vector) for both neutrinos and DM, compute modified neutrino fog effects, and compare with DM interaction constraints.

Result: Stronger bounds on light mediator couplings when linked to DM; mediator interactions significantly alter the neutrino fog morphology, affecting DM exclusion limits compared to standard spin-dependent/independent models.

Conclusion: New mediator couplings must be considered in future DM experiments to avoid misinterpretation of signals as DM, with XENONnT data crucial for refining both neutrino and DM interaction models.

Abstract: Current ton-scale, xenon-based dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments have now reached the sensitivity required to observe solar neutrinos, marking the onset of the so-called neutrino fog. In this work, we explore how this fog is modified when either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through a new scalar, vector, or axial-vector interaction, considering both heavy and light mediators. Using the latest nuclear-recoil data from XENONnT, which show indications of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8$B solar neutrinos, we derive new strong bounds on light mediator couplings. We find that these limits are significantly more stringent when the mediator couples to DM, rather than when new physics affects only neutrino interactions. Building on these results, we recompute the expected neutrino fog and compare it with the corresponding constraints on spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon interactions. We show that the morphology of the neutrino fog can be markedly modified if either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through light mediators, even in light of these recent constraints.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper recalculates the non-local sub-leading contribution to the $\bar B \to X_s γ$ decay, including the previously subtracted Voloshin term and addressing uncertainties' correlation at order $α_s$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incomplete treatment of the non-local contribution by previous studies that subtracted the local Voloshin term and did not account for uncertainties' correlation between the local and non-local terms.

Method: Performs a comprehensive calculation of the complete non-local contribution, incorporating the Voloshin term and analyzing the high correlation between uncertainties of the local and non-local terms at the $α_s$ order.

Result: Provides an improved estimation of the non-local effect by considering both the Voloshin term and correlated uncertainties, enhancing accuracy in penguin decay calculations.

Conclusion: The inclusion of the Voloshin term and proper uncertainty correlation is crucial for precise calculations of $\bar B \to X_s γ$ decays at higher order perturbative QCD.

Abstract: In all previous calculations of the non-local sub-leading contribution to the inclusive penguin decay $\bar B \to X_s γ$ due to the interference of the electroweak operators ${O}_1^c$ - ${O}_{7γ}$ the local Voloshin term was subtracted. In view of the ongoing analysis at order $α_s$, we present a calculation of the complete non-local contribution which takes into account the high correlation between the uncertainties of the local Voloshin and the non-local term of the previous analyses.
