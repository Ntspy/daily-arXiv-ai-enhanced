### [1] [Simultaneous JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA Monitoring of Sgr A*: A Unified Picture of the Variable IR, X-ray and Radio Emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20786)
*F. Yusef-Zadeh,M. Wardle,R. G. Arendt,C. O. Heinke,C. J. Chandler,H. Bushouse,G. A. Moellenbrock*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents simultaneous observations across infrared, X-ray, and radio wavelengths of Sgr A* on April 5, 2024, reporting correlated flaring activity. It proposes a coronal mass ejection-like magnetic reconnection model involving a flux rope and current sheet to explain the multi-wavelength emissions through inverse Compton scattering and particle acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand Sgr A*'s flux variability as a probe of strong-gravity accretion disk processes and connect multi-wavelength flare emissions to underlying physical mechanisms.

Method: Simultaneous observations using JWST (IR), NuSTAR (X-ray), and VLA (radio) on April 5, 2024. Analysis of flare timing, luminosity correlations, and theoretical modeling of particle acceleration/reconnection scenarios.

Result: Detected coincident IR/X-ray flares (X-ray luminosity ~5.2×10³⁵ erg/s) and delayed radio brightening. Results favor inverse Compton scattering as the X-ray mechanism linked to an IR-bright current sheet reconnection event.

Conclusion: Proposes a unified model where magnetic flux rope ejection and reconnection drive multi-wavelength emissions: IR beaming/up-scattering produces X-rays, while oppositely directed electrons radiate radio waves via adiabatic cooling in expanding flux tubes.

Abstract: Flux variability is a fundamental channel of information from Sgr A* because of its direct probe of processes occurring within an accretion disk under strong gravity. We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion. This physical picture attempts to unify the origin of the variable emission from Sgr A* at IR, X-ray and radio/submm wavelengths.

### [2] [Universal relations between the quasinormal modes of neutron stars and magnetic tidal deformability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20867)
*Hajime Sotani*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study derives universal relations for quasinormal modes (f-, p₁-, w₁-) of neutron stars as functions of magnetic tidal deformability, showing accuracy comparable to electric tidal deformability methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how magnetic tidal deformabilities, a higher-order effect in neutron star binaries, can be used alongside quasinormal modes to infer neutron star properties via gravitational wave asteroseismology.

Method: Derive universal relations linking quasinormal mode frequencies (f-, p₁-, w₁-) to magnetic tidal deformability, extending existing frameworks beyond electric tidal deformabilities.

Result: Successful derivation of accurate universal relations for quasinormal modes using magnetic tidal deformability, comparable in precision to those using electric tidal deformability.

Conclusion: Magnetic tidal deformability is a viable补充 to electric deformability for extracting neutron star structure information from gravitational waves, enhancing asteroseismology capabilities.

Abstract: Tidal deformabilities are one of the observable quantities characterizing neutron stars, which are strongly associated with the stellar compactness, the ratio of the stellar mass to the radius. In addition to the tidal deformability, the quasinormal modes excited in a neutron star are also an important property for extracting information about the neutron star interior, adopting gravitational wave asteroseismology. In this study, we especially focus on the magnetic tidal deformability, which acts on the gravitational waveform from a neutron star binary merger as a higher-order effect than the electric tidal deformability, and derive the universal relations expressing the quasinormal modes, such as the fundamental ($f$-), 1st pressure ($p_1$-), and 1st spacetime ($w_1$-) modes, as a function of the magnetic tidal deformability. The universal relations derived in this study exhibit accuracy more or less comparable to those of the electric tidal deformability.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $μ=12.2$ for GW190521 and $μ=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap.

### [4] [GW241011 and GW241110: Hints of Hierarchical Mergers from the Merger Entropy Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20965)
*Guo-Peng Li,Xi-Long Fan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the origin of two unusual gravitational wave events (GW241011 and GW241110), suggesting they may arise from hierarchical mergers in dense star clusters, particularly supported for GW241011 using a merger entropy index analysis. GW241110's origin is less certain due to large uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the atypical properties of GW241011 and GW241110 (extreme mass asymmetry, high primary spins, and spin-orbit misalignment) that challenge traditional stellar collapse formation models.

Method: Used the merger entropy index to analyze the hierarchical merger mechanism's feasibility for these events, comparing with models of dense star clusters.

Result: GW241011 shows consistency with hierarchical mergers in dense clusters. GW241110's origin remains ambiguous due to large uncertainties affecting method-dependent conclusions.

Conclusion: Hierarchical mergers are plausible for GW241011, but GW241110 requires further study to resolve uncertainties and confirm its origin.

Abstract: GW241011 and GW241110 both exhibit extremely asymmetric masses, high primary spins, and significant spin-orbit misalignment, which challenge the formation of first-generation binary black hole mergers formed from stellar collapse. This implies that these two gravitational wave events might originate from the hierarchical merger mechanism, with at least one of the black holes being the remnant of a previous merger. Here we investigate the origin of hierarchical mergers for GW241011 and GW241110 using the merger entropy index which measures the efficiency of entropy transfer for binary black hole mergers in general relativity. We find that GW241011 is consistent with hierarchical mergers in dense star clusters. The origin of GW241110 remains under debate due to its large distribution uncertainty, which leads to method-dependent inference and should be taken into account when interpreting this event in terms of hierarchical mergers.

### [5] [IMPACTX: An X-ray Spectral Model for Polar Dust and Clumpy Torus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20993)
*Kanta Fujiwara,Yoshihiro Ueda,Shoji Ogawa,Yuya Nakatani,Ryosuke Uematsu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMPACTX, an X-ray spectral model incorporating both a clumpy torus and polar dusty gas, using 3D radiative transfer simulations. It shows that combining X-ray and infrared data improves AGN structure constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To account for the polar dusty gas in AGN models, beyond traditional clumpy torus-only approaches like XCLUMPY, and improve the accuracy of AGN structure analysis through multiwavelength observations.

Method: Developed IMPACTX using SKIRT radiative transfer code with a geometry combining clumpy torus (Nenkova 2008) and paraboloid-shell polar dusty gas. Compared to XCLUMPY, and applied to NGC 4388's X-ray/IR data.

Result: IMPACTX successfully reproduces NGC 4388's X-ray and infrared spectra when combined with the IMPACT model. Highlights the necessity of multiwavelength data for accurate AGN structure modeling.

Conclusion: Polar dusty gas significantly influences AGN spectral features. Using both X-ray and infrared data is crucial for constraining AGN geometry and physical parameters.

Abstract: We construct a generic X-ray spectral model for the reflection component from the clumpy torus and dusty gas in the polar region (polar dusty gas) in an active galactic nucleus (AGN), designated as Inclusive spectral energy distribution Model of Polar dust And Clumpy Torus for X-ray (IMPACTX). To calculate the spectra, we utilize the Monte-Carlo based, 3-dimensional radiative transfer code SKIRT. The adopted geometry is the same as that of the IMPACT model (Ogawa et al. in prep.), consisting of a clumpy torus defined by Nenkova et al. (2008) and paraboloid-shell polar dusty gas launched at the inner radius of the torus. We discuss the dependence of the X-ray spectrum on geometrical parameters in comparison with the conventional torus-only model (XCLUMPY). As an example, we have simultaneously applied the IMPACTX and IMPACT models to the X-ray and infrared spectra of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4388, and have found a solution that can well reproduce both spectra. This demonstrates the importance of using both X-ray and infrared data to constrain the nuclear structure of an AGN.

### [6] [Evolution of the 2021 Outburst of GX 339-4 with AstroSat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21139)
*Vaibhav Sharma,Ranjeev Misra,J S Yadav,Akash Garg,Pankaj Jain*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines the 2021 outburst of GX 339-4 using AstroSat data, revealing spectral and timing changes across its hard and soft intermediate states. Key findings include stable disc properties during SIMS, spectral hardening, evolving QPO frequencies, and delays between disc and corona variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the spectral and timing characteristics of GX 339-4's outburst states, particularly the relationship between disc stability, spectral evolution, and QPO behavior during HIMS and SIMS.

Method: AstroSat observations were analyzed for spectral (flux, photon index) and timing (PDS, QPOs) properties across HIMS and SIMS. Models relating disc and coronal variations were tested against rms and lag spectra.

Result: Disc properties remained stable during SIMS with spectral hardening (photon index drop). QPO frequencies evolved from 0.1 Hz to 5.7 Hz across states, showing a final decrease. Time delays between disc and corona parameters explained observed rms/lag spectra.

Conclusion: The findings support disc-corona interaction models where variable coronal heating and disc dynamics drive QPO evolution and timing features during outburst transitions.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the 2021 outburst of GX 339-4 using AstroSat observations in the hard-intermediate (HIMS) and soft-intermediate states (SIMS). Spectral and timing analyses across these states suggest that during the SIMS, unabsorbed flux (0.1-3 keV), inner disc temperature, and "apparent" inner disc radius do not change, suggesting the stability of the disc. In the SIMS, the photon index decreases from 2.1 to 1.7, indicating spectral hardening. The power density spectra (PDS) suggest the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the HIMS and SIMS. The QPO frequency evolves from 0.1 Hz to 0.2 Hz in the HIMS, and further to 5.7 Hz in the SIMS. We also observe a decrease in QPO frequency from 5.7 Hz to 4.5 Hz during the SIMS. We discuss the evolution of the QPO, fractional root mean square (rms) amplitude, and time-lag spectra. We discover that variations in disc normalization, disc temperature, and coronal heating rate can reproduce the observed rms and lag spectra with a time delay between them.

### [7] [Exploring the Role of Vector Potential and Plasma-$β$ in Jet Formation from Magnetized Accretion Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21216)
*Ishika Palit,Miles Angelo Paloma Sodejana,Hsiang-Yi Karen Yang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines the impact of initial vector potential and plasma parameters on accretion columns and jet formation in magnetized accretion flows around black holes using GRMHD simulations. Results show dependencies of jet efficiency and accretion dynamics on magnetic field topology and plasma beta, shedding light on disk evolution states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how initial magnetic field configurations and plasma parameters influence the development of accretion columns and jets, which are critical for explaining phenomena like jet launching efficiency and the transition between different accretion disk states.

Method: General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations were conducted with two configurations of the vector potential Aφ and three plasma beta values (β = 50, 100, 500) to study magnetic flux accumulation and accretion dynamics near black holes.

Result: Varied magnetic field strengths and plasma beta values significantly affect magnetic flux accumulation near black holes, accretion column growth, and jet launching efficiency. Results indicate conditions favoring magnetically arrested disk states versus standard accretion behavior.

Conclusion: Initial magnetic topology and plasma beta critically determine accretion flow dynamics and jet formation, providing a framework to predict when magnetically arrested disk states occur versus standard accretion regimes based on these parameters.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how the choice of initial vector potential and plasma parameters influences the development of accretion columns and jet formation in magnetized accretion flows. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we explore two different configurations of the vector potential $A_φ$ and three plasma beta values $β$ = 50, 100, 500. We analyze how variations in the poloidal magnetic field strength and plasma magnetization affect magnetic flux accumulation near the black hole and the subsequent growth of the accretion column. Our results highlight the dependence of jet launching efficiency and accretion dynamics on the initial magnetic field topology and plasma beta, offering insight into the conditions that favor magnetically arrested disk or standard and normal evolution states.

### [8] [Assessing systematic uncertainties from spectral re-analysis of Cyg X-1 with different coronal geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21230)
*Abdurakhmon Nosirov,Jiachen Jiang,Cosimo Bambi,John A. Tomsick*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a spectral reanalysis of Cyg~X-1 using NuSTAR and Suzaku data, comparing three disk reflection models to assess geometric assumptions' impact on parameters like black hole spin and disk inclination. The disk-like corona model provides physically reasonable results with lower inclination and comparable fit quality, while allowing broader parameter ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify systematic uncertainties in black hole spin and disk inclination estimates caused by differing coronal geometry assumptions in previous studies, motivated by new polarization data favoring extended coronae.

Method: Reanalyzed existing NuSTAR/Suzaku observations using three models: broken power-law (previous standard), compact lamppost corona, and extended disk-like corona. Compared fit quality and derived parameters across models.

Result: Disk-like corona model delivers statistically similar fits but yields more physically consistent results (e.g., 30° inclination, nₑ~10²⁰ cm⁻³). It allows wider parameter space for spin and coronal inner radius due to added model flexibility.

Conclusion: The disk-like corona remains a strong, physically motivated model for Cyg~X-1's X-ray emission despite broader parameter ranges, highlighting the importance of geometry assumptions in determining relativistic accretion disk properties.

Abstract: In this work, we carry out a new spectral reanalysis of NuSTAR and Suzaku observations of the disk reflection spectra in the stellar-mass black hole X-ray binary Cyg~X-1. We compare three types of models: a broken power-law disk emissivity profile with no assumption about the coronal shape used in the previous work of the same observations, a compact lamppost corona, and an extended disk-like corona motivated by recent X-ray polarization results. Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\rm e}\approx10^{20}$\,cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results. While the extended corona model infers a wider allowed parameter space for black hole spin and the inner radius of the disk-shaped coronal region, this reflects the additional physical freedom of the model. Even so, the disk-like corona remains a strong and physically well-motivated candidate for explaining the X-ray emission from Cyg~X-1.

### [9] [Minijets and Broken Stationarity in a Blazar : Novel Insights into the Origin of $γ$-ray Variability in CTA 102](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21240)
*Agniva Roychowdhury*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes 18 years of Fermi-LAT data for CTA 102, finding a shift from log-normal to reduced-skewness gamma-ray flux distributions after a 2017 flare. This transition suggests magnetic relaxation and is modeled via minijets-in-a-jet simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical log-normal blazar flux distributions indicate multiplicative processes in jets/accretion. The 2017 flare in CTA 102 provided an opportunity to test whether state transitions alter these distributions, potentially revealing underlying physical mechanisms like magnetic field evolution.

Method: Analyses of Fermi-LAT GeV light curves (2008-2025), statistical tests for log-normality/skewness, Monte Carlo simulations of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model incorporating external Compton scattering. Fit distributions to observed/simulated data using modified log-normal power-law functions.

Result: Pre-flare GeV light curves showed log-normal distributions but post-flare exhibited significantly reduced skewness. Simulations matching observational data confirm magnetic relaxation解释 after major flares: initial chaotic reconnection events (2017 flare) followed by ordered magnetic fields at energy minima.

Conclusion: Blazar flux distribution changes reflect jet dynamics, specifically magnetic relaxation post-flare. The minijets model adequately explains CTA 102's gamma-ray behavior, supporting the role of structured minijet activity in driving observed flux statistics and state transitions.

Abstract: High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $γ$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.

### [10] [ZTF SN Ia DR2 follow-up: Characterization of subluminous Type Ia supernovae in the ZTF DR2 full sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21256)
*Alaa Alburai,Lluís Galbany,Umut Burgaz,Georgios Dimitriadis,Joel Johansson,Mat Smith,Ramon Sanfeliu,Sandra Guerra,Tomás Müller-Bravo,Ariel Goobar,Suhail Dhawan,Young-Lo Kim,Jakob Nordin,Alice Townsend,Jesper Sollerman,Madeleine Ginolin,Mickael Rigault,Jacco H. Terwel,Roger Smith,Avery Wold,Tracy X. Chen,Theophile Jegou du Laz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents a detailed analysis of 124 subluminous Type Ia supernovae from ZTF DR2, examining their photometric, spectroscopic properties and host galaxy environments. It finds these SNe exhibit intrinsic redness, distinct spectral features, and a preference for massive, red hosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of subluminous SNe Ia by analyzing the largest homogeneous sample, addressing gaps in their classification, luminosity-velocity relations, and environmental dependencies.

Method: Combines SALT2 light-curve parameters with SNooPy template fits, uses Spextractor for spectral analysis, constructs spectral averages by subtype, and evaluates host galaxy properties like color, mass, and light radius.

Result: Subluminous SNe Ia (except 02es-like) are intrinsically red; their colors cause SALT2 to overestimate $c$ and extend x1 to negative values. All subtypes except 02es-like reside in the Cool region of Branch's diagram. Host galaxies are more massive and redder, with 91bg/86G-like SNe occurring farther out. Ti II+Si II+Mg II pEW and s_BV are key subclassification indicators.

Conclusion: Subluminous SNe Ia exhibit unique spectral, photometric, and environmental characteristics that differ from normal SNe Ia. These findings refine their sub-classification criteria and highlight the need for tailored light-curve models.

Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 2 (ZTF DR2) includes a total of 3,628 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), providing the largest and most complete sample of spectroscopically confirmed SNe~Ia at low redshift to date. In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances. Finally, we identify the $pEW$ of the blended Ti II+Si II+Mg II absorption feature at 4300~A, along with s_BV, as robust and sufficient indicators for subclassifying subluminous SNe~Ia.

### [11] [On the decay of a light spinless particle into two photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20695)
*Ferruccio Feruglio,Gabriele Levati,Robert Ziegler*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the effective couplings of a light, gauge-singlet scalar φ to photons, deriving a low-energy effective theory incorporating isospin-breaking effects and η-η' mixing. It computes φ→γγ decay rates and discusses specific scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interactions of a light scalar boson with photons in scenarios where CP-violation and new physics at high scales (Λ) contribute, using a controlled expansion valid at low energies.

Method: Derive low-energy effective theory from electroweak-scale Lagrangian including CP-violating terms. Expand couplings systematically in 1/Λ and small mass ratios (m_φ²/m_η², m_π²/m_η²). Include isospin-breaking and η-η' mixing effects. Compute decay rates at one-loop with first-order terms in 1/Λ.

Result: Explicit expressions for photon couplings up to specified orders, and predicted decay rates for φ→γγ under different scenarios considering mixing effects and isospin violation.

Conclusion: The derived framework provides a systematic method to study light scalar-photon interactions with high-scale suppressed terms, useful for interpreting experimental searches or astrophysical observations involving such particles.

Abstract: We analyze the effective couplings of a light, spinless, gauge-singlet particle $φ$ to on-shell photons. Starting from the most general theory at the electroweak scale, which allows for CP-violating interactions suppressed by inverse powers of an ultraviolet scale $Λ$, we derive the corresponding low-energy effective theory valid below the GeV scale. Within this framework, we systematically expand the effective couplings of $φ$ to on-shell photons in powers of small parameters. Working at the one-loop level, we retain terms at first order in $1/Λ$. We incorporate both isospin-breaking effects and $η$-$η'$ mixing, and provide explicit expressions for the couplings up to first order in $m_φ^2/m_η^2$ and $m_π^2/m_η^2$. As applications, we compute the decay rate of $φ$ into two photons and illustrate our results in several physically motivated scenarios.

### [12] [Quirks Live in Cool Universes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20696)
*Pouya Asadi,Graham D. Kribs,Markus A. Luty*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that cosmological observations constrain the reheat temperature of the Standard Model in quirk models to $T_\text{RH} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV, affecting baryogenesis and suggesting that quirk discoveries at colliders could have significant cosmological implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interplay between quirk model parameters and cosmological constraints, particularly the reheat temperature's bounds and their implications for baryogenesis and dark matter.

Method: Analyzing cosmological effects like BBN disruption, CMB distortions, γ-ray excesses, self-interacting dark matter, and $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ contributions caused by relic glueballs from UV freeze-in in minimal quirk models.

Result: Strong bounds on $T_\text{RH}$ are established, tensions arise with baryogenesis models, and glueball dark matter is viable for quirk masses above ~10 TeV.

Conclusion: Quirk discoveries at colliders could bridge particle physics and cosmology, as their parameters are tightly constrained by cosmological observations, necessitating dark sector extensions to evade bounds.

Abstract: We demonstrate that cosmological observations place strong bounds on the reheat temperature $T_\text{RH}$ of the Standard Model (SM) in minimal models of `quirks' -- heavy fermions transforming under the SM gauge group together with a new non-Abelian gauge interaction with a confinement scale far below the mass of the fermions. These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T_\text{RH} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $γ$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $ΔN_{\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T_\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders.

### [13] [Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions from LLE-type R-parity Violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20704)
*Fang Xu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) in R-parity-violating supersymmetry with split-family sleptons, finding NSI effects up to 8% in some channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential for NSI in a specific supersymmetric model where third-generation sleptons are lighter, aiming to understand observable effects and constraints.

Method: Classified coupling patterns, derived effective interactions, calculated NSI parameters, and tested against experimental constraints.

Result: Found NSI parameters like ε_{ee} ≈8% and ε_{μμ}≈3.8%, with others at sub-percent levels. Identified differences between $	ilde{τ}_R$ and $	ilde{τ}_L$ scenarios.

Conclusion: Substantial NSI effects are feasible in this model, offering testable predictions for particle physics experiments.

Abstract: We study neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) induced by the trilinear $LLE$ couplings in $R$-parity-violating supersymmetry in a split-family spectrum where third-generation sleptons can be comparatively light. We systematically classify the relevant coupling patterns, derive the corresponding effective interactions and NSI parameters, and confront the resulting parameter space with a broad set of experimental constraints. We find that percent-level NSI can be realized in selected channels, with the largest magnitudes reaching $\varepsilon_{ee}\simeq 8\%$ and $\varepsilon_{μμ}\simeq 3.8\%$, while other entries are typically restricted to the sub-percent level (including $\varepsilon_{μτ}\simeq -0.3\%$ in the viable off-diagonal case). We also highlight the structural origin of the different constraint patterns between $\widetildeτ_R$- and $\widetildeτ_L$-mediated scenarios and comment on the relation to the Zee model.

*Balma Duch,Pere Masjuan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses using Padé approximants to determine the $f_0(500)$ resonance pole by analytically continuing the ππ-scattering amplitude from the physical region to the complex energy plane, improving upon previous determinations through better threshold behavior consideration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the precision of determining resonance poles (specifically $f_0(500)$) using the Padé method by ensuring correct threshold behavior in the parametrization of the scalar-isoscalar ππ partial wave.

Method: Application of Padé approximants to analytically continue the ππ-scattering amplitude, using improved parametrizations that enforce correct threshold behavior, allowing extraction of pole positions in the complex energy plane.

Result: Improved determination of the pole position of the $f_0(500)$ resonance, demonstrating the Padé method's capability as a simple yet precise tool for resonance pole extraction.

Conclusion: The Padé method, when applied with parametrizations respecting threshold constraints, provides a robust and accurate approach for locating resonance poles in scattering amplitudes, surpassing earlier results.

Abstract: In this letter, we discuss the determination of the $f_0(500)$ resonance by analytic continuation through Padé approximants of the $ππ$-scattering amplitude from the physical region to the pole in the complex energy plane. Using as input a class of admissible parametrizations of the scalar-isoscalar $ππ$ partial wave and imposing now the correct threshold behavior of the partial amplitude, we improve on the determinations of pole positions obtained in Ref. [1], thus empowering the Padé method as a simple and precise tool for extracting resonance poles from amplitudes.

### [15] [Echoes of $R^3$ modification and Goldstone preheating in the CMB-BAO landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20730)
*Tanmoy Modak*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines the $R^2$ and $R^3$ models of inflation, finding that the $R^2$ model is disfavored by current data but adding $R^3$ terms alleviates issues with the spectral index and enhances preheating processes, aligning with observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the tension between observed high spectral index values $n_s$ and theoretical predictions from $R^2$ Higgs inflation, which underperforms under CMB/BAO combined data.

Method: Analyzes the impact of including dimension-six $R^3$ terms in the inflationary action, focusing on how they modify the spectral index and facilitate Goldstone/Higgs preheating.

Result: The modified $R^3$ model favorably fits high $n_s$ observations, with preheating processes (especially Goldstone modes) bridging cosmic scales required for CMB consistency.

Conclusion: The inclusion of $R^3$ terms not only resolves the spectral index tension but also naturally explains the necessary preheating dynamics to align inflationary and CMB scales.

Abstract: The $R^2$ and the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation are disfavored by the observed high spectral index $n_s$ from the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at the $\sim2σ$ level. The addition of a dimension-six $R^3$ term in the action helps alleviate this tension. We show that the parameter space accounting for the observed high $n_s$ also induces rapid Goldstone and Higgs preheating. The preheating, especially from Goldstone modes, helps match the CMB and inflationary scales, which in turn supports the observed $n_s$.

*Daniel A. López Aguilar,Antonio Rodríguez Sánchez,Pablo Roig,Hanchen Yu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the inclusion of tensor interactions beyond the Standard Model (SM) in tau decays with three or more mesons, extending the work by Kühn and Mirkes. It emphasizes the importance of measuring generalized spectral functions for CP and T violation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to account for tensor interactions beyond the SM, which interfere with SM V-A currents and contribute to tau decays involving multiple mesons, not covered by existing frameworks. This allows more accurate measurements of spectral functions, critical for studying fundamental symmetries like CP and T violation.

Method: The method involves generalizing the structure functions introduced by Kühn and Mirkes to include tensor interactions. This extension ensures that contributions from beyond the SM are accounted for in tau decay analyses, particularly for decays with three or more mesons.

Result: The result is a framework that properly incorporates tensor interactions into tau decay analysis, highlighting the necessity of measuring generalized spectral functions. This approach provides model-independent data exploitation, enhancing the study of CP/T violation with multi-meson final states.

Conclusion: The conclusion stresses the importance of measuring generalized spectral functions to fully leverage experimental data for probing new physics, especially regarding CP and T violation in multi-hadron tau decays. This work underscores the need for experimental efforts in this direction.

Abstract: In case there are tensor interactions beyond the SM in the low-energy effective Lagrangian, their interference with the SM V-A currents yields a contribution for tau decays into three or more mesons that cannot be included in the famous structure functions introduced by Kühn and Mirkes in their seminal 1992 paper. We present this generalization here, highlighting again the importance of measuring the (generalized) spectral functions, as being model-independent and exploiting maximally the data. This can be particularly relevant for CP and T violation studies with at least three mesons in the final state of the tau decay.

### [17] [Irreducible Constraints on Hadronically Interacting Sub-GeV Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20825)
*Peter Cox,Matthew J. Dolan,Avirup Ghosh*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents strong upper limits on dark-matter-nucleon scattering cross-sections for sub-GeV dark matter using chiral effective theory, combining constraints from BBN, freeze-in production, and meson decays to rule out cross-sections above ~10^-36 cm².


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish tighter constraints on sub-GeV dark matter interactions that are independent of UV physics, addressing gaps in existing astrophysical/cosmological limits.

Method: Derives bounds using low-energy chiral effective theory, analyzing electromagnetic interactions at next-to-leading order and their effects on big bang nucleosynthesis and freeze-in mechanisms.

Result: Cross-sections for both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions are constrained to ≤10^-36 cm² for keV-100 MeV masses, surpassing previous limits by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: New constraints significantly impact low-mass direct detection experiments and highlight the necessity of considering sub-leading electromagnetic effects in dark matter models.

Abstract: We derive conservative upper limits on the dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-section for sub-GeV mass dark matter. Working exclusively within the low-energy chiral effective theory, we derive bounds that are independent of the details of the dark matter interactions in the UV. Dark matter that interacts only hadronically at leading order also inevitably interacts with photons or electrons at next-to-leading-order. We show that these electromagnetic interactions lead to strong constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis and over-production of dark matter via freeze-in at low temperatures, while the leading-order hadronic couplings face stringent constraints from meson decays. Combining these constraints, we rule out both spin-independent and spin-dependent dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-sections $\gtrsim 10^{-36}\,{\rm cm}^2$ for dark matter masses in the keV - 100 MeV range. These bounds are several orders of magnitude stronger than the existing constraints from astrophysics and cosmology and have significant implications for future low-mass direct detection experiments.

Result: Shows how connected/disconnected contributions interrelate in nucleon structure and parton distributions, enabling extension to non-perturbative phenomena in heavy-ion physics.

Conclusion: Generalized parton distributions effectively unify disconnected diagram contributions across different QCD observables, offering insights into baryon junction probing in high-energy nuclear collisions.

Abstract: Using the framework of generalized parton distribution, we provide a unified interpretation of the connected and disconnected contributions from the ab-initio Euclidean path-integral formulation of the hadronic tensor in both the nucleon elastic form factors and the parton distribution functions. We develop a phenomenology to elucidate non-perturbative contributions to deep inelastic structure functions, which can be extended to observables in heavy-ion collisions probing baryon junctions.

<details>

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields, focusing on the evolution of the photon intensity and polarizations induced by conversion into axions. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields characterized by the power spectra of their helical/non-helical components, we express the expectation values and variances of the photon intensity and linear/circular polarizations after conversion in terms of these spectra. We find nontrivial dependencies of these statistical quantities on the characteristic magnetic field correlation length, the propagation distance, and the axion mass. Moreover, we find that nontrivial polarizations emerge even if the photons are initially unpolarized, that the variances of these observables become suppressed in specific frequency regions, and that a peak structure arises in the expectation value of the circular polarization in the presence of statistically helical magnetic fields. We also point out consistency relations among these statistical quantities that hold independently of the specific forms of the magnetic field power spectra.

### [20] [Formulation of Relativistic Dissipative Spin Hydrodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20855)
*Asaad Daher*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This thesis develops a relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics framework incorporating spin density as a new macroscopic variable, using two methods: covariant thermodynamics extending Navier-Stokes/Müller-Israel-Stewart theories and relativistic quantum statistical mechanics generalizing Zubarev's approach. The theory addresses spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions and opens paths for microscopic verification and transport coefficient analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from recent measurements of spin polarization in hadrons from non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions, necessitating a theoretical framework that includes spin effects in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics.

Method: Two methods are used: 1) Covariant thermodynamics extending existing hydrodynamic theories by integrating a spin tensor, and 2) Relativistic quantum statistical mechanics generalizing the Zubarev approach. Both aim to create closed evolution equations and analyze entropy current to identify dissipative terms and transport coefficients.

Result: The framework provides a consistent theoretical foundation for relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics, enabling future applications in spin polarization studies and offering avenues for verifying thermodynamic relations microscopically and analyzing spin-related transport coefficients.

Conclusion: The theory not only supports phenomenological applications in spin dynamics but also encourages future research into microscopic validation and deeper understanding of spin-associated transport coefficients through modeling or data-driven methods.

Abstract: The primary objective of this thesis is to develop a consistent theoretical framework of dissipative hydrodynamics for a relativistic fluid with spin - hereafter referred to as relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics. In this framework, the dynamical description of a relativistic fluid requires a new macroscopic variable, the spin density, which is associated with a spin tensor. This tensor, defined as the expectation value of a rank-3 tensor operator in quantum field theory, contributes to the system's total angular momentum. The need for such a theory is motivated by recent measurements of spin polarization of hadrons produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
  Two distinct formulation methods are employed. The first is grounded in covariant thermodynamics and extends the conventional Navier-Stokes and Müller-Israel-Stewart theories of relativistic hydrodynamics by incorporating a spin tensor. The second is based on principles of relativistic quantum statistical mechanics, building upon and generalizing the foundational Zubarev approach. Both formulations aim to construct a closed system of evolution equations for the macroscopic variables and, via an entropy-current analysis, to identify the dissipative currents and their associated transport coefficients.
  These two approaches provide different perspectives for future applications focused on spin polarization measurements. Beyond its phenomenological relevance, the theory also opens several avenues for further theoretical developments. These include the verification of the thermodynamic relations employed in the first formulation method using microscopic frameworks, as well as a deeper understanding of the emerging transport coefficients - particularly those associated with the spin tensor - through microscopic modeling or data-driven parameter extraction.

*Masaki J. S. Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rephasing transformation for mapping a 4x4 flavor mixing matrix to the standard four-generation model parametrization, deriving all CP and Majorana phases using rephasing-covariant minors and determinant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the three-generation flavor mixing framework to four generations by systematically deriving phase parameters and ensuring consistency with three-generation results when the fourth generation is decoupled.

Method: The authors use rephasing-covariant minors and the determinant of the mixing matrix to construct explicit formulae for all CP-violating phases (three Dirac, three Majorana) and four unphysical phases through matrix element arguments.

Result: Derives phase expressions that smoothly transition to known three-generation results when the fourth generation is removed, providing a consistent four-generation framework for CP phase analysis.

Conclusion: The method offers a systematic approach to phase determination in four-generation models, maintaining compatibility with existing three-generation physics and enabling future studies of four neutrino generations.

Abstract: In this letter, we present an explicit rephasing transformation that maps a general $4\times4$ flavor mixing matrix to the standard parametrization of four-generation models. By combining rephasing-covariant minors and the determinant systematically, we derive expressions for all three Dirac-type CP phases, three Majorana phases, and four unphysical phases by arguments of matrix elements. The resulting formulae smoothly reduce to the three-generation results in the limit where the fourth generation decouples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining neutrino masses and leptogenesis while addressing theoretical issues of conventional seesaw models

Method: Constructed with $
eutrino mass hierarchies and mixing angles

Result: Consistent with experimental data on neutrino mass spectra and mixing angles

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a viable framework for understanding neutrino physics and leptogenesis defects in conventional models

Abstract: We propose a novel realization of linear seesaw model in a non-invertible selection rule with the assistance of $\mathbb Z_3$ symmetry. In our framework, Dirac mass matrices are generated at one-loop level, dynamically breaking the non-invertible symmetry while the symmetry is invariant under the tree-level. In addition to the active neutrino masses, the model exhibits rich and testable phenomenology such as non-unitarity bound, lepton flavor violations, lepton anomalous magnetic moment, and dark matter candidate. After describing our model, we carry out numerical analysis and show some results for our physical parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The continuous advances in modern experimental facilities motivate the study of unobserved radially excited F-wave bottom and bottom-strange mesons.

Method: Combination of theoretical inputs with experimental data on charm mesons, flavor-symmetry parameters, and calculations using hadronic coupling constants (tilde{g}_{ZH} and tilde{g}_{RH}) to predict masses and decay widths.

Result: Predicted masses for radially excited F-wave bottom states and their strange partners, along with upper bounds on their strong decay widths using current coupling constant estimates.

Conclusion: The predictions provide testable benchmarks for upcoming heavy-flavor spectroscopy experiments to observe these mesons.

Abstract: Motivated by the continuous advances in modern experimental facilities, we investigate the radially excited F-wave bottom and bottom-strange mesons that have not yet been observed experimentally. By combining theoretical inputs with available experimental information on charm mesons and applying flavor-symmetry parameters, we predict the masses of the radially excited F-wave bottom states and their strange partners. In addition, we compute their strong decay widths in terms of the hadronic coupling constants $\tilde{g}_{ZH}$ and $\tilde{g}_{RH}$. Using the presently estimated values of these couplings, we obtain upper bounds on the corresponding decay widths. These predictions will serve as testable benchmarks for forthcoming heavy-flavor spectroscopy findings.

### [24] [Large lepton asymmetry from axion inflation and helium abundance hinted by ACT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21117)
*Di Wu,Yifan Hu,Kohei Kamada*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores generating a lepton asymmetry via chiral anomaly in pseudoscalar inflation with a gauged U(1)_{L_i-L_j} symmetry, but faces challenges due to backreaction, which can be mitigated through suppressed fermion production, potentially achieving observable helium abundance effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of generating an observable lepton asymmetry in pseudoscalar inflation models, specifically using the chiral anomaly mechanism and gauged lepton flavor symmetries.

Method: The authors analyze the production of helical magnetic fields and chiral asymmetry through the chiral anomaly in models with Chern-Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, considering the impact of backreaction and proposing mechanisms to suppress fermion production during inflation.

Result: In standard scenarios, the lepton asymmetry is too small for observations, but suppressing fermion production increases the asymmetry from magnetic helicity decay. For U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}, this asymmetry may significantly reduce primordial helium, aligning with ACT CMB findings.

Conclusion: The proposed suppression mechanism overcomes backreaction limitations, enabling feasible lepton asymmetry generation, with potential cosmological implications like observable helium abundance changes.

Abstract: The generation of helical magnetic fields and the associated chiral asymmetry via the chiral anomaly is a generic feature in pseudoscalar inflation. In the presence of a Chern--Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT.

*Qi Wu,Zhong-Quan Sun,Dian-Yong Chen,Shi-Dong Liu,Gang Li*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates dipion transition processes of the X(3872) particle using molecular state models and chiral perturbation theory, finding significant branch ratios and isospin violations, with observable mass spectra features like double-bump structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore dipion transition mechanisms of the enigmatic X(3872) particle and test its molecular state composition through branching ratio predictions and isospin violation analysis.

Method: Employed heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory, analyzing box/triangle loop diagrams with nonrelativistic EFT power counting. Modeled X(3872) as D^0 D^{*0} + anti-components molecular system.

Result: Calculated branching ratios of 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-5 for transitions to χc0, χc1, χc2 respectively. Predicted deviation from isospin expectations via π+π- vs π0π0 ratios. Observed double-bump structures in specific invariant mass spectra.

Conclusion: Dipion transitions confirm X(3872)'s molecular nature and isospin violation effects. Proposed experimental verification via double-bump mass distributions and ratio comparisons against isospin predictions.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dipion transition processes $X(3872)\to ππχ_{cJ} (J=0,1,2)$ within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory, treating $X(3872)$ as a molecular state composed of $D\bar{D}^*+h.c.$ components. By analyzing the box and triangle loop diagrams with nonrelativistic effective field theory power counting rule, we demonstrate that box diagrams dominate these dipion transitions processes. Branching ratios are calculated as functions of the mixing angle $θ$, which parameterizes the neutral and charged meson compositions of the $X(3872)$. Our results indicate that the branching fractions for $X(3872)\toππχ_{c0}$, $X(3872)\to ππχ_{c1}$, and $X(3872)\to ππχ_{c2}$ are of orders $10^{-4}$, $10^{-3}$, and $10^{-5}$, respectively. We also predict the ratios ${\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow ππχ_{c0/2}]}/{\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow ππχ_{c1}]}$ and ${\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow π^+π^-χ_{cJ}]}/{\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow π^0π^0χ_{cJ}]}$. The latter deviates from isospin-symmetry expectations, revealing various degrees of isospin violation. By studying the $π^+π^-$ and $π^+χ_{cJ}$ invariant mass spectra, we find a double-bump structure in the $π^ + π^-$ invariant mass distributions of the process $X(3872)\to π^+π^-χ_{c1}$ and $π^+χ_{c0}$ invariant mass distribution of the process $X(3872)\to π^+π^-χ_{c0}$, which could be tested by the future experimental measurements.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates the production of neutral D-mesons in Xe+La collisions using the Geant4 FTF model and compares it with experimental data, finding a discrepancy. It also provides predictions for charmed meson production in smaller nucleus-nucleus interactions for the NICA/SPD experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility of the Geant4 FTF model in predicting charmed meson production in heavy-ion collisions and to understand the origin of enhanced charm production observed experimentally, which may indicate new physics beyond standard models like quark-gluon plasma effects.

Method: Utilized the Geant4 FTF model to simulate neutral D-meson production in Xe+La collisions at 150 GeV/nucleon. Additionally, performed simulations for p+p, d+d, and ⁴He+⁴He interactions at √s_NN = 10 and 20 GeV to support future NICA/SPD experiments.

Result: The calculated yield from Geant4 FTF matches existing Monte Carlo models but significantly underestimates preliminary experimental data, suggesting enhanced charm production in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Simulations for smaller systems provide baseline predictions for upcoming experiments.

Conclusion: The discrepancy between model predictions and experimental data implies possible new mechanisms in charm production at high energies. The results highlight the need for improved models and emphasize the importance of upcoming NICA/SPD data for better understanding charm dynamics in nuclear collisions.

Abstract: The total yield of neutral D-mesons (4$π$) in central Xe+La interactions at 150 GeV per nucleon has been calculated within the Geant4 FTF model. Our calculation is close to predictions of Monte Carlo models that do not account for quark-gluon plasma formation. As the predictions, our calculation substantially underestimates preliminary experimental data. The experimental data indicate enhanced charmed particle production in nucleus-nucleus interactions. We present also our calculations for charmed meson production in ${\rm p+p}$, ${\rm d+d}$ and ${\rm ^4He+^4He}$ interactions for future NICA/SPD experiment at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$10 and 20 GeV.

Conclusion: Rare meson decays offer a valuable probe for sub-GeV dark matter, filling gaps where direct detection experiments are insensitive.

Abstract: Current dark matter direct detection experiments have low sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we demonstrate that rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays with missing energy in the final state can serve as efficient probes in this mass range. We analyze a generic $Z^{\prime}$ portal dark matter model and derive upper limits on its parameters from experimental bounds on the rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays. Our results show that such meson decay processes provide complementary constraints to current direct detection experiments for sub-GeV dark matter, particularly for interaction forms mediated by dark matter momentum dependent operators.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how randomness in fermion mass parameters can generate nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles and how this depends on the geometry of the mass graph, analyzing three geometries in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino setups. It identifies regimes where disorder-driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and structured mixings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if randomness in fermion mass parameters can lead to nonanarchical neutrino mixing and understand the influence of mass graph geometry on this phenomenon, building on Craig and Sutherland's work on Anderson localization for neutrino masses.

Method: The authors analyze three geometries (nearest neighbour chain, fully connected non-local model, Petersen graph) with both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realizations, examining strong and weak disorder regimes. They study localization effects, mass scale generation, and mixing angle behaviors.

Result: In strong disorder, all geometries show robust localization producing anarchical mixing. Weak disorder allows quasidegenerate eigenmodes leading to GIM-like cancellations for light neutrino masses, enabling structured mixings dependent on geometry and localization.

Conclusion: Disorder-driven mechanisms in specific geometries can generate hierarchical neutrino masses and structured flavor mixings under certain conditions, distinguishing between strong and weak disorder regimes.

Abstract: We revisit the proposal of Craig and Sutherland that Anderson localization in a disordered fermion theory space can generate small neutrino masses from TeV scale physics \citecraig2018exponential}. Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise.

TL;DR: The paper explores quantum entanglement in a scalar Yukawa theory using light-front Hamiltonian methods, finding that entanglement entropy relates to parton distributions and reveals non-classical correlations in unquenched systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate non-perturbative quantum entanglement in strongly coupled scalar Yukawa theory and its connection to parton structure and non-classical correlations.

Method: First-principles light-front Hamiltonian methods with Fock-space truncations, constructing reduced density matrices from light-front wave functions to compute entanglement witnesses like von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and linear entropy in quenched and unquenched frameworks.

Result: Entanglement entropy correlates with Shannon entropy of transverse momentum distributions in quenched systems but demonstrates non-classical correlations in unquenched cases, showing quantum information beyond classical probabilities.

Conclusion: Entanglement is a key probe for non-perturbative QFT dynamics, providing foundational insights for QCD and collider phenomenology.

Abstract: We perform a first-principles, non-perturbative investigation of quantum entanglement between partonic constituents in a strongly coupled 3+1-dimensional scalar Yukawa theory, using light-front Hamiltonian methods with controlled Fock-space truncations. By explicitly constructing reduced density matrices for (mock) nucleon, pion, and anti-nucleon subsystems from light-front wave functions, we compute key entanglement witnesses, including von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and linear entropy, in both quenched (no sea pairs) and unquenched frameworks. We find that the entanglement entropy is closely related to the Shannon entropy of the transverse momentum dependent distribution, establishing a link between quantum information and parton structure. In contrast, the unquenched theory reveals genuinely non-classical correlations: the entanglement entropy cannot be reduced to any Shannon entropy of normalized parton distributions, demonstrating that the full hadronic wave function encodes quantum information beyond classical probabilities. Our findings highlight the role of entanglement as a fundamental probe of non-perturbative dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory and lay the groundwork for extending these concepts to QCD and future collider phenomenology.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general framework for studying extremal black holes in 4D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, focusing on a one-parameter family of pathology-free spinning dyonic black holes when magnetic and electric charges are equal, supported by near-horizon analysis including both perturbative and numerical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore asymptotically flat spinning dyonic extremal black holes in 4D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, particularly under the stringy dilaton coupling (γ=1), to identify conditions ensuring physically valid (pathology-free) solutions.

Method: The method involves constructing a general framework, analyzing the near-horizon geometry through both perturbative closed-form solutions and numerical methods, and imposing the condition of equal magnetic/electric charges to ensure solution validity.

Result: The key result is the discovery of a one-parameter family of extremal black holes free of pathologies when their charges are equal, validated via near-horizon analysis and solution techniques.

Conclusion: The conclusion underscores the importance of charge equality for achieving physical validity in these extremal black hole solutions within the specified theory parameters, offering insights into their structure and potential for further study.

Abstract: We propose a general framework for the study of asymptotically flat spinning dyonic {\it extremal} black holes (eBHs) in $D=4$ Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. Restricting to the stringy value $γ=1$ of the dilaton coupling constant, we report on the existence of a one parameter family of eBHs which are free of pathologies, provided their magnetic and electric charges are equal. An understanding of this condition is found from a study of the near horizon limit of the solutions, both perturbative closed form and numerical solutions being presented.

*Filippo Santoliquido,Jacopo Tissino,Ulyana Dupletsa,Marica Branchesi,Jan Harms*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of various configurations for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors using neural posterior estimation, focusing on massive high-redshift binary black hole mergers. It finds that a two-misaligned L-shaped Einstein Telescope setup outperforms a triangular configuration in reducing sky-position degeneracies, and adding Cosmic Explorer further improves localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine the optimal configuration for future global XG GW detector networks (ET and CE) by assessing their performance in detecting high-mass, high-redshift BBH mergers. These binaries are critical for understanding early-Universe stellar/primordial black holes and intermediate-mass binaries, which XG detectors are poised to discover.

Method: The authors use neural posterior estimation (NPE) via Dingo-IS, combining normalizing flows and importance sampling, to analyze network configurations. They compare results against standard Bayesian inference, focusing on BBH systems with detector-frame chirp masses >100 M☉. Key parameters studied include luminosity distance and sky position.

Result: NPE accurately replicates complex posterior structures. The 2L MisA ET configuration showed multimodal distance posteriors with degeneracy issues but fewer sky-multimodalities compared to triangular ET, improving sky localization. Adding CE further reduced sky degeneracies while maintaining 2L MisA's superiority.

Conclusion: Misaligned L-shaped ET pairs provide better sky and volume localization than triangular configurations. Combining ET and CE maximizes detection capabilities for massive BBH systems, guiding future detector network design priorities.

Abstract: The coming decade will be crucial for determining the final design and configuration of a global network of next-generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, including the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.

*José Rodal*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines scalar curvature invariants in Alcubierre's warp-drive spacetime, revealing the need for four anisotropic stress-energy layers for warp bubbles and clarifying misinterpretations of its curvature relative to a Schwarzschild black hole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically assess curvature invariants in the Alcubierre model, correct misrepresentations in prior works, and address misconceptions about spacetime classification and energy requirements.

Method: Analyzes scalar curvature invariants (I, R, r1, r2) using the Weyl and Ricci tensors; compares with Mattingly et al.'s results; contrasts with Schwarzschild curvature of Saturn-equivalent mass.

Result: 发现了四个各向异性应力能量层的必要，并指出Mattingly等人的图表中曲率不变量被低估了8至16个数量级，同时明确了Alcubierre时空的分类不属于B类翘曲乘积时空。

Conclusion: 准确表征Alcubierre warp drive的时空曲率至关重要，需修正错误数据表示，并明确其与黑洞及理论分类系统的区别以避免误解。

Abstract: In the Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime, we investigate the following scalar curvature invariants: the scalar $I$, derived from a quadratic contraction of the Weyl tensor, the trace $R$ of the Ricci tensor, and the quadratic $r1$ and cubic $r2$ invariants from the trace-adjusted Ricci tensor. In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble. Additionally, we delve into the Kretschmann quadratic invariant decomposition. We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn. The paper addresses potential misconceptions about the Alcubierre warp-drive due to inaccuracies in representing spacetime curvature changes and clarifies the classification of the Alcubierre spacetime, emphasizing its distinction from class $B$ warped product spacetimes.

Motivation: To develop estimation techniques for solutions of first-order spinor equations by leveraging space spinor formalism and extending methods from second-order hyperbolic equations.

Method: Adapting the positive commutator method for second-order equations to first-order spinor equations using space spinor formalism, analyzing hyperbolicity in this context, and comparing with other estimation strategies.

Abstract: We show how the space spinor formalism for 2-component spinors can be used to construct estimates for spinor fields satisfying first order equations. We discuss the connection of the approach presented in this article with other strategies for the construction of estimates. In addition, we recast several concepts related to the notion of hyperbolicity in the context of spinor equations. The approach described in this article can be regarded as an adaptation to first order equations of the method of positive commutators for second order hyperbolic equations.

*Joaquin Estevez-Delgado,Roberto De Arcia,Gabino Estevez-Delgado,Israel Quiros*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the asymptotic cosmological behavior of an f(R,Tφ) gravity model with quadratic trace couplings, finding late-time accelerated expansion but requiring non-linear perturbation analysis for viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses gaps in understanding asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology within f(R,Tφ) gravity, which has been less explored despite extensive f(R,T) research.

Method: The authors derived cosmological equations for a flat, homogeneous universe, formulated an autonomous system with dimensionless variables, identified critical points, analyzed their stability, and checked energy conditions and instabilities. They compared scenarios with α≠0, β≠0 against minimal coupling cases (α=β=0).

Result: Quadratic Tφ terms allow late-time de Sitter-like acceleration, but some accelerated points are in a degenerate scalar sector where linear perturbations can't confirm stability. Only the non-degenerate quasi-de Sitter point is saddle-type.

Conclusion: While the model supports accelerated expansion at background level, full viability needs non-linear analysis beyond current linear methods in degenerate sectors.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the asymptotic cosmological dynamics of a modified gravity model based on the $f(R,T^φ)$ theory, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^φ$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor of a scalar field. Despite the extensive study of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology remain largely unexplored. We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^φ) = R + αT^φ+ β(T^φ)^2/2$, in which the parameters $α$ and $β$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $α\neq 0$ and $β\neq 0$, along with the subcases $α= 0$ and $β= 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $α= β= 0$. We find that the quadratic term in $T^φ$ admits late-time accelerated de Sitter-like critical solutions at the background level. However, several accelerated points lie in a degenerate scalar sector with $Q_s=0$, where the standard linear perturbation criteria are inconclusive, while the quasi-de Sitter point with $Q_s>0$ is of saddle type. Therefore, establishing full perturbative viability requires going beyond the linear analysis in the degenerate sector.

Abstract: Circular photon orbits have become an attractive topic in recent years. They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties. The development of analytical methods for these circular orbits has also drawn extensive attention. In our recent work, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L021501}{Phys. Rev. D \textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons).

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores modeling a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as a correlated qubit system, where each horizon is a qubit. The study constructs density matrices and finds that gravitational effects impose stricter correlation constraints than the Araki-Lieb inequality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quantum nature of multi-horizon black holes and explore their thermodynamic behaviors within the context of quantum gravity, which remains unresolved.

Method: The authors model the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as two correlated qubits, associating their entropies with subsystem qubit entropies. They derive reduced density matrices for subsystems and the overall system.

Result: Successful construction of density matrices and identification that gravitational effects impose a lower bound on qubit correlations exceeding the Araki-Lieb triangle inequality constraints.

Conclusion: The approach provides a novel quantum information perspective on black hole thermodynamics, suggesting gravity imposes unique constraints on quantum correlations that could advance quantum gravity research.

Abstract: The thermodynamic behaviours of multi-horizon black holes such as a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole have been one of the long-standing mysteries in gravitational physics since they involve quantum natures in gravitational systems and that the search for quantum gravity has not reached its conclusion. In this work, we seeked for a possibility of realising the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as a correlated qubit system, where each of the event horizon is treated as a qubit and both of them are correlated in a way that two qubits could be. By identifying the entropies of subsystems to those of qubits, we successfully constructed the reduced density matrices of the two subsystems as well as the density matrix for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, modelled as 2-correlating qubits. Moreover, our results suggested that when the gravitational effect has its role in the qubit systems, supposedly like black holes, the correlation between qubits are constrained with a lower bound more stringent than the so-called Araki-Lieb triangle inequality.

*Koushiki,Rituparno Goswami,Pankaj S. Joshi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the covariant collapse of a mass-less scalar field, showing that the balance between collapsing and dispersing modes determines the outcome—black hole formation or dispersion. A critical case reveals a locally naked null singularity with zero geometrical mass, governed by a single dimensionless parameter, independent of initial ansatz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which a mass-less scalar field collapse leads to a black hole versus dispersion, identifying critical phenomena and the nature of resulting singularities without assuming specific initial conditions.

Method: The authors analyze the covariant collapse dynamics of mass-less scalar fields, examining the competing effects of collapse and dispersion. They derive conditions based on mode strengths and identify a critical case characterized by a naked null singularity, confirming the role of a single dimensionless parameter.

Result: A phase transition-like behavior is found where the system's fate (black hole or dispersion) is determined by a single parameter. The critical case produces a locally naked null singularity with zero geometrical mass, applicable to all mass-less scalar field families without ansatz dependence.

Conclusion: The study establishes a universal framework for mass-less scalar field collapse, showing that outcomes are parameter-controlled and that naked singularities can emerge as critical states. This challenges assumptions about singularity cloaking and highlights the importance of geometrical mass in collapse dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we observe the collapse of a mass-less scalar field covariantly. We show that the strengths of the collapsing and dispersing modes of this scalar field will decide whether the collapse will end up in a black-hole or disperse. We find a locally naked null singularity as a critical case between these two and confirm that there is a single dimensionless parameter that determine the end state. This work is ansatz-independent, hence, true for all mass-less scalar field families. We also show that the geometrical mass of these singularities go to zero.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies the effect of non-thermal, nonclassical quantum states (Squeezed Number State and Coherent Squeezed Number State) on black hole radiation in an FRW universe. It derives how parameters like squeezing (ρ) and number state (n) influence Hawking temperature, entropy, and mass loss, showing stronger nonlinear effects compared to thermal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous thermal squeezed-state models to a fully number-state-resolved framework, exploring how nonclassical quantum states affect Hawking radiation in a cosmological context beyond thermal assumptions.

Method: Semiclassical gravity framework applied to SNS and CSNS states in FRW spacetime. Analytical derivations of Hawking temperature, entropy change, and mass loss equations, analyzed with twelve plots varying parameters ρ and n.

Result: Hawking temperature increases monotonically with ρ and n. Entropy changes show strong nonlinear enhancements at higher squeezing. Nonclassical states produce more significant effects than thermal models, highlighting quantum state sensitivity.

Conclusion: Non-thermal nonclassical states significantly impact black hole evaporation dynamics. The results underscore the importance of quantum state parameters in gravitational particle creation processes in cosmology, offering new insights beyond classical or thermal approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in a spatially flat FRW Universe for two fundamental nonclassical states: the Squeezed Number State (SNS) and the Coherent Squeezed Number State (CSNS). Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $ρ$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $ρ$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $Δ\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $Δ\mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations. These findings contribute a new perspective on gravitational particle creation in cosmological settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore diffeomorphism-invariant states in LQG that satisfy an area-law for entanglement entropy and mimic semiclassical geometry, serving as viable boundary states for the theory's dynamics.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of Bell-network states on a dipole graph to characterize their quantum geometric properties and test their applicability to homogeneous/isotropic configurations.

Result: Identified effective geometry with entangled fluctuations resembling QFT in curved spacetime, confirming Bell-network states as valid candidates for representing isotropic/homogeneous quantum geometries.

Conclusion: Bell-network states on dipole graphs provide a promising framework for understanding quantum geometry in LQG and could act as boundary states for exploring the theory's dynamic behavior.

Abstract: Bell-network states constitute a class of diffeomorphism-invariant and entangled states of the geometry within loop quantum gravity (LQG) that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in the limit of large spins. The fluctuations of the geometry for a Bell-network state are entangled, similar to those in the semiclassical limit as described by quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. This analysis provides a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid numerical framework to account for nonperturbative effects in calculating scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from primordial curvature perturbations, revealing significant amplifications and frequency shifts in acoustic GW signals compared to perturbative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard perturbative calculations neglect nonperturbative effects in large-amplitude regimes, leading to potential inaccuracies. The authors aim to address this gap by developing a framework that captures these effects for better predictions of stochastic GW backgrounds.

Method: A hybrid approach combining fully general-relativistic spherical simulations to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles and 3D lattice evolutions of hydrodynamics coupled with metric perturbations to compute GW spectra.

Result: Nonperturbative effects amplify acoustic GW signals by an order of magnitude, shift peak frequencies to lower values, and produce a causal low-frequency tail proportional to k³. The amplitude scales as R*_{c}^{-7} with peak frequency determined by shell thickness.

Conclusion: Nonperturbative effects are critical for accurate SIGW predictions, especially in the large-amplitude regime, emphasizing the necessity of advanced numerical frameworks over traditional perturbative approaches.

Abstract: Standard perturbative calculations of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) have neglected nonperturbative effects in the large-amplitude regime. We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations.

Abstract: We revisit the Starobinsky model of inflation in light of recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which indicates a potential preference for a slightly larger scalar spectral index $n_s$ than predicted by the standard $R^2$ scenario. We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\fracα{4}{\cal G}$ ($\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $α$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities. This work establishes the quadratic $f(L)$ gravity as a compelling and physically motivated extension that preserves the successes of Starobinsky inflation while improving its fit to modern precision cosmological data.

*Ming-Xin Li,Jin Pu,Yi Ling,Guo-Ping Li*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores how the internal curvature structure of nonsingular black holes with Minkowski cores influences their observable optical shadows, classifying them into three types based on curvature behavior and showing how each type's photon sphere properties affect shadow size and brightness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a direct link between the internal geometry of nonsingular black holes and their observable features, enabling tests of quantum gravity models through shadow observations.

Method: The authors classify nonsingular BH spacetimes into three types based on the Kretschmann scalar's dependence on mass. They analyze photon dynamics, focusing on parameters α and n affecting the photon sphere, and compute shadows under different accretion models.

Result: Type III BHs (K_max decreasing with M) show smallest, brightest shadows with high parameter sensitivity, while Type I (K_max increasing) have largest, dimmest shadows. This curvature-based classification correlates with observable shadow differences.

Conclusion: Observable black hole shadows can distinguish between different nonsingular models sharing similar exteriors but varying internal curvatures, offering a new method to test quantum gravity-inspired theories with upcoming observations.

Abstract: We establish a direct connection between the interior curvature structure of nonsingular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core and their observable optical signatures. By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters α and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates gravitational wave signals from eccentric EMRIs in non-vacuum environments with scalar charges, accretion disks, and dark matter halos. It shows that scalar charge effects can be distinguished from vacuum cases and LISA could detect scalar charge with ~0.1 relative error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how scalar charges and astrophysical environments affect EMRI gravitational wave signals, and to assess detectability by future detectors like LISA.

Method: Computed waveform modifications by incorporating scalar charge effects on fluxes and trajectories in non-vacuum spacetimes. Compared parameter configurations between environments and vacuum cases.

Result: Scalar charge effects on EMRI waveforms are distinguishable from vacuum scenarios. LISA could constrain scalar charge with ~0.1 relative error in such environments.

Conclusion: Beyond-vacuum spacetime effects (scalar charge, accretion disks, dark matter) significantly alter EMRI signals, offering a new detection avenue for scalar charges via gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: We compute the gravitational wave signal from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded within beyond-vacuum environments, where the secondary object carries a scalar charge and evolves in the presence of both an accretion disk and a dark matter halo. The waveform modification is derived by incorporating the scalar charge correcting the fluxes and orbital trajectories of the secondary. Our results indicate that, under suitable parameter configurations, the influence of the scalar charge on EMRIs waveform in such environments can be distinguished from that in vacuum spacetime. For the EMRIs signal modified by the astrophysical environments, the future space-borne detector can determine the relative error of scalar charge constrained by LISA at the level of $\sim0.1$, providing a preliminary prediction of detecting scalar charge in the beyond-vacuum spacetime.

*Lydia Bieri,David Garfinkle,James Isenberg,David Maxwell,James Wheeler*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper shows that specific asymptotic structures in asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets for General Relativity can be predetermined using the conformal method with seed data inputs like ADM momentum components and decay rates. It also provides a numerical example of an initial dataset with stronger asymptotics that breaks the antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the extent to which asymptotic structures can be prescribed in General Relativity and to test the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinities through explicit examples. Prior works did not achieve such strong asymptotics or symmetry breaking.

Method: Using the conformal method, the authors specify seed data including ADM momenta, decay rates, and metric anisotropy to construct initial data sets. They then perform numerical constructions to create an explicit example with desired asymptotic properties.

Result: A numerical example is provided where the initial dataset has stronger asymptotics than previously achieved and its evolution doesn't exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate both the prescriptive power of the conformal method in specifying asymptotic structures and the potential invalidity of the antipodal symmetry conjecture. This opens new avenues for constructing tailored initial data sets with controlled asymptotics and challenges existing assumptions about symmetry in spacetime evolution.

Abstract: We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.

Motivation: Gravitational waves offer a unique probe into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, allowing exploration of fundamental phenomena across different scales. The aim is to bridge theoretical frameworks with observational strategies to advance our understanding of these areas.

Method: The paper begins with linearized general relativity to derive gravitational waves, then uses geometric methods involving the Weyl tensor to explore energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extensions to cosmological contexts include analyzing wave evolution during inflation and cosmological epochs, adiabatic mode analysis, and their effects on the cosmic microwave background. Observational strategies across detection technologies are surveyed.

Result: Derives the inflationary vacuum gravitational wave spectrum and its role in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Establishes connections between gravitational radiation and the Weyl tensor's algebraic structure. Summarizes current observational capabilities and identifies future research directions.

Conclusion: The review underscores gravitational waves as a versatile tool for testing gravity theories, probing early universe physics, and detecting astrophysical events. It highlights the need for continued multi-frequency observational efforts and theoretical advancements to fully leverage gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.

### [46] [DRAGNs in the Forest: Identifying Artifacts with Random Forest Models in the VLASS DRAGNs Catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20999)
*Verene Einwalter,Eric J. Hooper,Melissa E. Morris,Sarah Bach,Yjan A. Gordon*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: A method using random forest models classified DRAGNs from VLASS data, achieving a 97% F1 score and enabling a nearly artifact-free catalog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The VLASS Quick Look data has imaging artifacts contaminating DRAGN catalogs, necessitating a classification system to identify and remove these artifacts.

Method: Trained random forest models to classify DRAGNs based on the number of artifacts (0-3) using features from their components. Addressed class imbalance through dataset selection and optimized models.

Result: Best model achieved a 97.01% weighted F1 score. Resulting catalog can extract 97.7% artifact-free sources with 99.3% completeness.

Conclusion: Effective classification mitigates artifacts, providing reliable DRAGN catalogs for future research and confirming the viability of machine learning in this astronomical context.

Abstract: The Quick Look data products from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) contain widespread imaging artifacts arising from the simplified imaging algorithm used in their production. The catalog of double radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) found in the VLASS first epoch Quick Look release using the DRAGNhunter algorithm suffers from contamination from these artifacts. These sources contain two or three individual components, each of which can be an artifact. We train random forest models to classify these DRAGNs based on the number of artifacts they contain, ranging from zero to three artifacts. We optimize our models and mitigate the class imbalance of our dataset with judicious training set selection, and the best of our models achieves a weighted F1 score of $97.01\%^{+1.12\%}_{-1.32\%}$. Using our classifications, we produce a catalog of VLASS DRAGNs from which an estimated 99.3% complete catalog of 97.7% artifact-free sources can be extracted.

*Joyful E. Mdhluli*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The OAD uses a scientific Impact Cycle to evaluate astronomy-for-development projects, ensuring effective, evidence-informed design and selection, thereby minimizing negative outcomes and maximizing cost-effective impacts through continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure astronomy-for-development projects are effective, avoiding negative consequences and achieving positive impacts by learning from past experiences.

Method: Development and implementation of the OAD Impact Cycle, focusing on project design, selection, and delivery systems to facilitate continual improvement through evidence-based evaluation.

Result: Creation of a library of best practices and a positive feedback loop for future projects by identifying successful and unsuccessful initiatives.

Conclusion: The Impact Cycle supports data-driven decision-making, enhances project effectiveness, and fosters sustainable expansion of successful astronomy-for-development initiatives.

Abstract: The Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) believes that in order for astronomy-for-development activities to be effective, a scientific approach is required. Evaluation is an essential component in identifying which projects work best, for whom and under what conditions. Evidence-informed project design and selection ensures that projects build on past lessons, thereby reducing the risk of negative unintended consequences and increasing the probabilities of positive cost-effective impact. The OAD has developed an Impact Cycle that aims to enhance project design, selection and delivery systems to support such continual improvement and potential expansion. By determining what works - and, importantly, what doesn't work - the OAD can build a library of evidence on best practice and ensure a positive feedback loop for future projects.
