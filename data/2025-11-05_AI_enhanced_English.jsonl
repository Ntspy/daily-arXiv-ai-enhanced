UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos\ndecouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d}\n\\approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann\nsuppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much\ngreater than $m_{\\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at\nfreeze-out.

In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo\nUFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative,\npost-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination.

In particular, we restrict our\nanalysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric\nfunction is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\\alpha$\nand of the one-form $\\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the\nconformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of\nconformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models\nobtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the\npresence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The\ngeneralized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the\nRiemannian metric $\\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nrepresentation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a\nspecific relationship between the component of the one-form $\\beta$ and the\nconformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is\ndetermined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free\nparameter $\\gamma$ of the model.
