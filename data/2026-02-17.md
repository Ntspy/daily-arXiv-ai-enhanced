### [1] [Symmetric teleparallel gravitational effects on solar neutrino oscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13355)
*Aysel Cetinkaya,Muzaffer Adak,Özcan Sert,Caglar Pala*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates neutrino oscillations in the context of symmetric teleparallel gravity, introducing a novel framework to probe non-metricity via cosmic observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore gravitational effects on neutrino oscillations in a less studied framework (symmetric teleparallel gravity) that uses non-metricity instead of curvature or torsion, opening new avenues for testing quantum gravity interfaces.

Method: Derived Dirac Hamiltonian using reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the Sun, calculated phase differences of neutrino mass eigenstates, constrained six coupling constants using observational data to simplify computations.

Result: Established that neutrino oscillations can probe non-metricity, provided upper bounds on coupling constants, and demonstrated a new method to test symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.

Conclusion: Neutrino oscillations are validated as a unique probe of symmetric teleparallel gravity's non-metricity, offering a实验 approach to quantum gravity studies beyond traditional general relativity frameworks.

Abstract: Neutrino oscillations probe the quantum gravity interface in unique ways. While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.

### [2] [Dynamical Formation of Self-Similar Wormholes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13609)
*Yasutaka Koga,Ryota Maeda,Daiki Saito,Daisuke Yoshida*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates dynamical formation of self-similar wormholes using colliding negative-energy null dust streams, showing black holes can evolve into wormholes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how traversable wormholes can form dynamically from black holes by solving Einstein equations with specific boundary conditions and spacetime patching.

Method: Numerical solution of reduced Einstein equations under self-similarity, constructing geometries via patching Schwarzschild, Vaidya spacetimes, and wormhole regions using Barrabes-Israel formalism.

Result: Demonstrates that sufficiently large throat radii maintain regularity in spacetime while forming wormholes from black holes through energy and shell interactions.

Conclusion: Generalizes Hayward & Koyama's static model to non-static cases, providing new insights into wormhole formation dynamics with regular geometries.

Abstract: We study spherically symmetric, self-similar wormhole solutions supported by colliding streams of negative-energy null dust, and their dynamical formation. Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole. Our analysis generalizes the formation model for static wormhole solutions proposed by Hayward and Koyama in 2004 to non-static wormhole solutions, offering a novel perspective on the formation of regular traversable wormholes.

### [3] [Harmonic Analysis on Correlation for Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds of Arbitrary Polarization from Interfering Sources in Generic Dispersion Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13621)
*Yan-Chen Bi,Yu-Mei Wu,Qing-Guo Huang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates how interference between discrete gravitational wave sources affects the detection of a gravitational-wave background (GWB), showing that such interference can mimic modified gravity effects and impose observational limits on distinguishing General Relativity from alternative theories using pulsar timing arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the Hellings-Downs correlation in real-world scenarios where supermassive black hole binaries cause interference between discrete GW sources, which can obscure or mimic modified gravity signals.

Method: Derivation of closed-form spatial correlation functions for GWBs with arbitrary polarization and generic dispersion relations, harmonic analysis to assess multipole moments, and statistical evaluation of parameter degeneracies introduced by source interference.

Result: Source interference modifies correlation shapes but preserves the fundamental multipole moments (quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, monopole for scalar modes). Higher multipoles depend on pulsar distances and dispersion. There's a degeneracy between interference and modified gravity effects.

Conclusion: Reliance on spatial correlations alone is insufficient to distinguish modified gravity from GR due to fundamental limits imposed by observing a single cosmic realization.

Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation serves as the fundamental benchmark for detecting the gravitational-wave background (GWB) in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) within General Relativity (GR). However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone.

### [4] [Spherically symmetric black holes in Gravity from Entropy and spontaneous emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13694)
*Udaykrishna Thattarampilly,Yunlong Zheng,Vishnu Kakkat*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study analyzes static and dynamical spherically symmetric black holes in the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) framework, showing Schwarzschild geometry corrections, consistent with astrophysical observations. It reveals mass-evolution driven by higher-order stresses and predicts constant evaporation at large masses and Hawking-like behavior at intermediate scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the GfE framework modifies black hole physics, test its consistency with observations, and understand mass-evolution mechanisms through geometric stresses.

Method: Derived and solved modified vacuum field equations for static/dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes in GfE, analyzing corrections to Schwarzschild geometry and mass-loss rates.

Result: Found r^-4 perturbative corrections to Schwarzschild metric, consistent with strong-field observations. Identified mass-evolution driven by geometric stresses, constant evaporation rate (-β/24) for large masses, and Hawking-like M^-2 scaling at intermediate scales.

Conclusion: GfE provides a viable classical alternative to Hawking radiation, explaining mass-loss through entropic leakage and geometric stresses without quantum effects, aligning with astrophysical data.

Abstract: We investigate static and dynamical spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) framework. We derive and solve the modified vacuum field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, revealing that the classical Schwarzschild geometry receives perturbative corrections scaling as $r^{-4}$. We establish that the GfE framework is consistent with current strong-field astrophysical observations. Higher-order geometric stresses inherent to the GfE vacuum drive a consistent mass-evolution profile. In the limit of large black hole mass, the theory predicts a constant background evaporation rate $ -β/24$, suggesting an inherent "entropic leakage" of the vacuum. At intermediate scales, the framework replicates the standard Hawking radiation mass-loss law as $\dot{M} \propto M^{-2}$ through a purely classical response of the modified background.

### [5] [Reconstruction of Accelerating Nonlinear $f(T)$ Gravity Models via Hybrid Scale Factor: Cosmological Dynamics and Bayesian Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13744)
*Suraj Kumar Behera,Pratik P. Ray*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes three non-linear $f(T)$ gravity models using a hybrid scale factor to explain the universe's expansion history. Parameters are constrained using MCMC with BAO and Patheon+SH0ES data. The models align with accelerated expansion, violate the strong energy condition, and mimic $Λ$CDM at late times, supporting $f(T)$ gravity as a viable alternative to dark energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore modifications of gravity that explain cosmic acceleration without dark energy, validate $f(T)$ gravity models against observational data, and determine their consistency with cosmological evolution from early deceleration to late-time acceleration.

Method: Reconstruct three non-linear $f(T)$ gravity models using a hybrid scale factor. Parameters constrained via MCMC analysis with Bayesian statistics and observational data (BAO, Patheon+SH0ES). Analyze dynamical parameters like the equation of state and assess energy conditions, particularly the violation of the strong energy condition.

Result: Models align with accelerated expansion phases, violate strong energy conditions (indicative of dark energy dominance), and mimic $Λ$CDM at late times. They satisfy observational and theoretical requirements, providing insights into extending general relativity.

Conclusion: The reconstructed $f(T)$ models are consistent with cosmological observations and offer a robust framework for cosmic acceleration, suggesting $f(T)$ gravity as a viable alternative to traditional dark energy paradigms within general relativity.

Abstract: This study offers a comprehensive reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity model with three distinct non-linear as well as novel forms employing a hybrid scale factor to depict the expansion history of the universe starting from early decelerated epoch to late-time accelerated evolution. Model parameters are rigorously constrained using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis with the help of Bayesian statistics and incorporating late-time observations from BAO and Patheon+SH0ES. The investigation of dynamical parameters such as the equation of state parameter and cosmological parameters indicates alignment with an accelerated expansion phase in both the present and late time epochs. Validation is conducted by assessing the energy conditions, verifying the feasibility of the model forms with particular emphasis on the violation of the strong energy condition that indicates dark energy dominance in modified gravity scenarios. This investigation has been instrumental in determining models that remain consistent with cosmological observations and theoretical requirements. The reconstructed forms of the model effectively mimic $Λ$CDM at late times, providing significant insights into possible extensions of general relativity and bolstering $f(T)$ gravity theory as a robust explanation for cosmic acceleration.

### [6] [Bounding the graviton mass using non-linear density wave theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13854)
*M. Vukcevic*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper uses a corrected Newtonian gravitational potential incorporating non-linear effects and the non-linear density wave theory (NLDW) to derive an upper bound for the graviton mass. The derived bound aligns with LIGO/Virgo collaboration results and offers an independent method compared to previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new bounds on graviton mass using non-linear effects in gravitational potentials, distinct from existing modified gravity theories like Yukawa, MOND, or ΛCDM.

Method: The method involves applying the corrected Newtonian potential with non-linear effects, solving the non-linear Schrödinger equation to find the wave wavelength, and equating it to the graviton's Compton wavelength to calculate the mass bound.

Result: The calculated upper bound for graviton mass agrees well with LIGO/Virgo collaboration data, providing a novel independent validation method.

Conclusion: The approach successfully establishes an upper limit for the graviton mass using a unique theoretical framework, complementing existing methods without dependency on prior techniques.

Abstract: In this paper we use the Newtonian gravitational potential corrected by non-liner effects to obtain new bounds on graviton mass using non-linear density wave theory (NLDW). This potential differs from the gravitational potential obtained in other modified gravity theories (e.g. the weak field limit of Yukawa gravity, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, non-local theories, $Λ$ cold dark matter..). Using this model, we are able to define wavelength of the non-linear wave as an analytical solution of integrable non-linear differential equation (namely, non-linear Schrodinger equation). Assuming that the wavelength of the non-linear wave represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we have found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. We compare obtained result with first assessments of LIGO $\&$ Virgo collaboration and we find they are in a good agreement. Present model used to determine the upper limit of graviton mass is completely independent from other methods published until now. We have compared our result with results obtained using several chosen published methods.

### [7] [Hidden Conformal Symmetry and Emergent Holographic Structure in the AdS Teo Rotating Wormhole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13923)
*Ramesh Radhakrishnan,Gerald B. Cleaver,William Julius*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores scalar perturbations in a rotating Teo wormhole within AdS spacetime, revealing an emergent conformal symmetry similar to rotating black holes. It derives the quasinormal-mode spectrum and holographically connects boundary correlators via wormhole traversal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand hidden conformal structures and spectral properties in horizonless geometries, contrasting them with black holes and exploring holographic interpretations in AdS/CFT contexts.

Method: Analyzing the Klein-Gordon equation's conformal structure using a logarithmic tortoise coordinate transformation. Constructing near-throat generators, deriving effective potentials, and calculating correlators via spacelike geodesics.

Result: Discovered a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum and demonstrated causal connectivity through the wormhole's throat, establishing a holographic link between AdS boundaries.

Conclusion: The AdS-Teo wormhole provides a new framework to study conformal symmetries and holography without horizons, offering insights into quantum gravity and boundary field theory connections.

Abstract: We study scalar perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole embedded in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and demonstrate that the radial Klein Gordon equation exhibits an emergent conformal structure. The smooth traversable throat induces a logarithmic tortoise coordinate that allows the radial equation to be recast as the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue equation, paralleling the hidden conformal symmetry of the rotating Kerr black hole but arising here in a horizonless geometry. The AdS-Teo spacetime possesses two disconnected timelike AdS conformal boundaries that remain causally connected through the wormhole throat, in contrast to the two-sided eternal AdS black hole where horizons play a central role. Using the emergent conformal symmetry, we construct the near-throat generators, derive the effective potential, and obtain a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum determined by regularity at the throat and standard AdS boundary conditions at infinity. The AdS embedding further enables a minimal holographic interpretation. As an explicit illustration, we compute an equal-time two-point function in the large-Delta (geodesic) limit from a regulated spacelike geodesic that traverses the wormhole, showing how the bulk geometry couples the two asymptotic boundaries. Together, these results provide a unified description of hidden conformal structure, spectral properties, and boundary correlators in a rotating, horizonless asymptotically AdS wormhole.

### [8] [Torsion-Induced Quantum Fluctuations in Metric-Affine Gravity using the Stochastic Variational Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13927)
*Tomoi Koide,Armin van de Venn*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how spatial torsion influences quantum fluctuations using Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) and the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM). It finds that torsion introduces non-linearity into quantum mechanics, affecting both spin and spinless particles, and explores the interplay between torsion and curvature in the Schrödinger equation. It also links SVM to information geometry, suggesting paths for future research in gravity and cosmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of torsion in quantum systems beyond its traditional association with spin degrees of freedom, and to explore geometric structures in MAG and SVM that can provide new insights into quantum fluctuations and cosmological questions.

Method: The authors combine MAG, which incorporates torsion and non-metricity, with SVM, a quantization method that handles geometrical effects. They analyze how torsion-induced geometrical structures affect quantum fluctuations and non-linearity in the Schrödinger equation, extending previous studies by comparing torsion's effects with Levi-Civita curvature.

Result: Torsion not only affects spin degrees of freedom but also impacts spinless particles via quantum fluctuations. A competition between torsion and curvature in non-linear Schrödinger equations is identified. The paper also draws a parallel between SVM and information geometry, linking time derivative splitting in stochastic processes to dual connections in statistical manifolds.

Conclusion: The findings highlight torsion's broader role in quantum mechanics and open avenues for extending gravity theories to include non-metricity. The SVM-information geometry connection suggests new approaches for addressing unresolved issues in cosmology and quantum gravity.

Abstract: This review paper comprehensively examines the influence of spatial torsion on quantum fluctuations from the perspectives of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) and the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM). We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schrödinger equation. Finally, we discuss the structural parallelism between SVM and information geometry, highlighting that the splitting of time derivatives in stochastic processes corresponds to the dual connections in statistical manifolds. These insights pave the way for future extensions to gravity theories involving non-metricity and are expected to deepen our understanding of unresolved cosmological problems.

### [9] [The Theoretical Landscape of Mimetic Gravity: A Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14082)
*O. Malaeb*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper reviews mimetic gravity, which extends GR by reparametrizing the metric into an auxiliary metric and a scalar field to mimic cold dark matter. It covers the theory's basis, cosmological applications, singularities resolution, and challenges like instabilities, offering solutions such as ghost-free modifications and Hořava gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend GR by exploring conformal degrees of freedom in gravity, address cosmological issues like dark matter and singularities, and investigate the physical implications of mimetic theories in cosmology and high-energy physics.

Method: Analyzes theoretical formulations of mimetic gravity, including its relation to GR, extensions like f(R, φ) and f(□φ) models, disformal transformations, and cosmological perturbations. Discusses solutions to instabilities and applications to early universe scenarios.

Result: Establishes mimetic gravity as a valid GR extension with novel degrees of freedom; demonstrates its capacity to model cosmological expansion, resolve singularities via limiting curvature, and address inflation problems. Highlights residual challenges like instabilities requiring further refinement.

Conclusion: Mimetic gravity offers promising avenues for unifying cosmic phenomena and resolving GR's limitations but requires addressing theoretical inconsistencies. Future research should focus on stabilizing the theory and exploring its observational signatures in cosmology and black hole physics.

Abstract: Mimetic gravity has emerged as a compelling extension of General Relativity (GR), originally motivated by the attempt to isolate the conformal degree of freedom of the gravitational field. By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, φ)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\Box φ)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Hořava gravity. Finally, we discuss the role of the mimetic field in the early universe, specifically in the context of asymptotically free gravity and the resolution of the self-reproduction problem in inflation.

### [10] [On the Cuspy Structure of Rotating Wormhole Shadows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14182)
*Peng Cheng,Ruo-Fan Xu,Peng Zhao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the shadow cast by a rotating traversable wormhole in the Teo class with a general redshift function, focusing on cuspy structures in the shadow boundary. It identifies a critical redshift parameter λ_c that triggers cusp formation and categorizes four shadow morphologies based on spin and redshift parameters, offering potential observational diagnostics for compact objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the characteristics of wormhole shadows and their distinguishable features from other compact objects like black holes, particularly through the emergence of cusps which depend on the redshift function variation. This aids in observational identification using future high-resolution imaging.

Method: Analyzing the shadow boundary formed by unstable circular orbits outside the throat and orbits at the throat itself. Investigating how varying the redshift parameter λ affects cusp formation, determining the critical value λ_c, and constructing a phase diagram based on spin and redshift parameters to classify shadow morphologies.

Result: Discovered that cusp formation occurs only when λ varies, establishing λ_c as the critical threshold. Four distinct shadow morphologies (smooth, cuspy, ears touching, throat drowning) are identified through the phase diagram. These findings suggest observable features that could differentiate wormholes from other objects.

Conclusion: The morphological diversity of wormhole shadows, especially the presence of cusps, provides potential observational signatures for distinguishing wormholes from black holes in future observations, emphasizing the role of redshift function and spin parameters in determining shadow structure.

Abstract: We investigate the shadow cast by a rotating traversable wormhole in the Teo class endowed with a general redshift function, with particular emphasis on the emergence of cuspy structures. The shadow boundary is the common envelope of two critical orbit families: unstable circular orbits outside the throat and orbits at the throat itself. The formation of cusps, marking the transition between smooth and cuspy shadow boundaries, only becomes possible when the redshift parameter $λ$ is allowed to vary. Moreover, we uncover a universal critical value $λ_c$ that signals the onset of the cusp. A phase diagram characterized by the spin and redshift parameters reveals four distinct morphologies: smooth, cuspy, ears touching, and throat drowning. The morphology of the wormhole shadow may provide observational diagnostics for the different compact objects in future high-resolution imaging observations.

### [11] [The initial states of high frequency gravitons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14235)
*Massimo Giovannini*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of classical and quantum inhomogeneities in cosmological backgrounds, focusing on constraining the initial states of relic gravitons at specific Hubble radius crossing times. It finds that while low-frequency gravitons (largest wavelengths) may arise from non-vacuum states, intermediate and high frequencies are dominated by vacuum-generated gravitons, with non-classical correlations peaking between kHz and THz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the initial states of relic gravitons affect cosmological observables like power spectra without relying on earlier epochs, addressing debates about the necessity of vacuum states. The motivation stems from wanting a pragmatic approach to cosmological perturbations that doesn't assume initial conditions far before observationally relevant times.

Method: The analysis distinguishes classical/quantum inhomogeneities effects and examines graviton production as wavelengths cross the Hubble radius. Instead of assuming a vacuum state initially, the work evaluates states with finite energy density at the crossing time, allowing observational constraints on possible non-vacuum contributions.

Result: Low-frequency gravitons (largest wavelengths) may come from non-vacuum states but are marginally allowed, while vacuum dominates at higher frequencies. Non-classical correlations (from quantum production without initial state contributions) dominate between kHz and THz frequencies.

Conclusion: Cosmological observables exhibit mixed origins: some gravitons require non-vacuum initial states only at low frequencies, while quantum vacuum fluctuations dominate elsewhere. The kHz-THz range uniquely shows strong non-classical correlations, suggesting potential experimental tests in these bands.

Abstract: After distinguishing the role of classical and quantum inhomogeneities in cosmological backgrounds, we constrain the initial states of the relic gravitons as soon as the different wavelengths of the spectrum cross the comoving Hubble radius, without any reference to earlier timescales. According to this pragmatic perspective the quantum states with finite energy density at the crossing time consistently affect the two-point functions and the related power spectra. An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum. The non classical correlations are expected to dominate between the kHz and the THz since in this region gravitons are produced quantum mechanically with a negligible contribution from the initial state.

### [12] [A synthetic Gannon-Lee incompleteness theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14246)
*Mathias Braun,Carlo Rotolo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proves the Gannon-Lee incompleteness theorem for globally hyperbolic spacetimes under synthetic null energy condition and a new trappedness condition called 'synthetically asymptotically regular', extending the classical result to weighted cases and suggesting future work on low regularity extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to generalize the classical Gannon-Lee theorem to weighted cases using synthetic geometry approaches, and to explore potential extensions under lower regularity conditions.

Method: The authors use the synthetic null energy condition introduced by Ketterer and a novel trappedness condition ('synthetically asymptotically regular'). They conduct the proof within the framework of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, applying methods from synthetic differential geometry.

Result: Successful generalization of the Gannon-Lee theorem to weighted scenarios. The results indicate feasibility of extending to low regularity settings, though detailed exploration is postponed.

Conclusion: The study confirms the theorem's validity under broader conditions and highlights avenues for future research in applying these methods to less regular spacetime structures.

Abstract: We prove the Gannon-Lee incompleteness theorem for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. We assume the synthetic null energy condition of Ketterer and a trappedness condition we call "synthetically asymptotically regular". Our result generalizes this classical result to the weighted case. It also motivates and indicates extensions to low regularity, which are deferred to future work.

### [13] [$Λ(t)$CDM Model: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14269)
*Himanshu Chaudhary,Ratul Mandal,Masroor Bashir,Vipin Kumar Sharma,Ujjal Debnath*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Investigated a time-varying cosmological constant model using BAO, supernova, and CMB data to constrain Λ(t)CDM parameters. Results show the interaction term Q(z) reverses sign with redshift, leading to distinct cosmic phases. The model favors dynamical dark energy (ω₀ > -1) over the ΛCDM cosmological constant (ω₀ = -1), supported by Bayesian evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the validity of a dynamically evolving dark energy model (Λ(t)CDM) by testing whether the cosmological constant changes over time and interacts with dark matter, using updated observational datasets.

Method: Combined DESI DR2 BAO measurements with Pantheon+, DES-Dovekie, Union3 supernovae, and CMB shift parameters. Applied MCMC analysis to constrain model parameters, performed dynamical system analysis to identify critical points in cosmic evolution, and used Bayesian evidence comparison to assess model support.

Result: Identified sign-changing interaction term Q(z) indicating vacuum-matter energy conversion. Found three critical points representing distinct cosmological eras. Predicted ω₀ > -1 (dynamical dark energy) and a transition phase at log(a) ≈ -0.51 to -0.48. Bayesian analysis strongly favors Λ(t)CDM over ΛCDM.

Conclusion: The model supports a time-dependent cosmological constant with dynamic dark energy behavior, challenging the static ΛCDM. The dataset-dependent results suggest observational data consistency in cosmic evolution phases, emphasizing the role of evolving energy interactions.

Abstract: We investigated a time-varying cosmological constant model using recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, combined with Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon$^{+}$, DES-Dovekie, and Union3) and CMB shift parameters, to constrain the $Λ(t)$CDM model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. We find that the interaction term $Q(z)$ shows a sign change for all dataset combinations by crossing $Q(z)=0$, depending on the choice of the dataset: at low redshift $Q(z)<0$, indicating vacuum energy decaying into dark matter, while at high redshift $Q(z)>0$, corresponding to dark matter decaying into vacuum energy. The dynamical system analysis found three critical points, namely $P_1,P_2$, and $P_3$ respectively. The resulting critical points, determined by the underlying cosmological parameters, correspond to distinct epochs in cosmic evolution. Depending on the parameter combinations, these points characterize various cosmological phases, ranging from an accelerated stiff matter-dominated era to late-time accelerated expansion. The stability of each critical point is analyzed using linear stability theory, with the relevant physical constraints on the cosmological parameters duly incorporated throughout the analysis. For each dataset combinations, the $Λ(t)$CDM model predicts that $ω_0 > -1$, showing a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant scenario with $ω_0 = -1$. Consequently, the model exhibits a transition phase in the range $N \equiv \log a(t) \approx -0.51$ to $-0.48$ and predicts $q_0$ in the range $-0.54$ to $-0.52$, with the precise transition point depending on the choice of dataset. Finally, the Bayesian evidence shows strong support for the $Λ(t)$CDM model over $Λ$CDM

*Gaoping Long,Cong Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Develops a framework in loop quantum gravity to consistently define superpositions of quantum geometry and matter states, ensuring unitary equivalence of Fock representations and deriving weak solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint. Generalizes the Hartle-Hawking state to explore geometry-matter entanglement and its implications for the black hole information paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address foundational challenges in quantum field theory on curved spacetime and provide a consistent framework that unifies quantum geometry with matter fields, particularly to study geometry-matter entanglement and resolve the black hole information paradox.

Method: Introduces restricted subspace of gravitational phase space for unitary equivalence of Fock representations across quantum geometries, derives weak solutions to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint, and generalizes the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state within loop quantum gravity.

Result: Establishes a well-defined state space with entangled geometry-matter states, shows how entanglement arises from the Hamiltonian constraint, and provides tools to study the quantum foundations of the black hole information paradox.

Conclusion: This work offers a principled framework for quantum geometry and matter interactions, advancing understanding of entanglement in quantum gravity and potential resolutions to the black hole information paradox.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a foundational challenge in quantum field theory on curved spacetime by developing a consistent framework within loop quantum gravity. We introduce a methodology for defining meaningful superpositions of quantum geometry and matter states. This is achieved by identifying a restricted subspace of the gravitational phase space, which ensures unitary equivalence among Fock representations of a scalar field across different quantum geometries. Within the resulting well-defined state space, we derive weak solutions to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. Furthermore, we generalize the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state to this quantum geometric framework. The resulting state exhibits the inherent entanglement between geometry and matter, which arises from the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. This work establishes a principled framework for studying geometry-matter entanglement and offers new insights into the quantum foundations of the black hole information paradox.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the acceleration interpolation relation in MOND's modified inertial interpretation and unify explanations for universe expansion and galactic rotation anomalies.

Method: Generalizes the Unruh effect's thermal spectrum to short-time non-uniform acceleration scenarios, linking quantum effects with spacetime curvature and MOND's requirements.

Result: Proposes a quantum equivalence principle extending classical equivalence to second-order quantum fluctuations, providing a framework for MOND and cosmological acceleration.

Conclusion: The quantum effect bridges MOND's kinematic modifications with quantum gravity principles, suggesting new directions in quantum reference frames and spacetime dynamics.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel quantum effect wherein particle spectra show extra broadening due to local short-time acceleration (as well as in a deSitter spacetime background). This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent.

*Lorenzo Gavassino,Áron D. Kovács,Harvey S. Reall*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'reduction of order' approach to handle unphysical degrees of freedom in relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and gravitational effective field theories by uniquely specifying initial data for unphysical modes based on physical modes, ensuring consistency within valid Lorentz frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of unphysical degrees of freedom in recent theories, ensuring theories remain well-posed and Lorentz invariance is preserved within applicable frames.

Method: Proposes applying 'reduction of order' only to initial data, not equations of motion, to constrain unphysical modes using physical mode data.

Result: Uniquely specifies initial conditions for unphysical modes, resolving inconsistencies without Lorentz violation when restricted to valid frames.

Conclusion: The approach provides a consistent framework for theories with unphysical modes, maintaining validity under Lorentz invariance assumptions of effective field theory.

Abstract: There has been recent progress in developing well-posed theories of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and of gravitational effective field theories. These have in common the feature that they introduce unphysical degrees of freedom. We address the problem of how these should be treated. We propose a ''reduction of order'' approach which is applied not at the level of equations of motion but only to initial data. This specifies uniquely the data for the unphysical modes in terms of the data for the physical modes. We argue that the apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance associated with this approach is not a problem provided one restricts to Lorentz frames for which the assumptions of effective field theory are manifestly valid.

### [17] [Investigating the impact of quasi-universal relations on neutron star constraints in third-generation detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14659)
*Natalie Williams,Anna Puecher,Guilherme Grams,César V. Flores,Tim Dietrich*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines biases in quasi-universal relations used for gravitational-wave analyses of binary neutron stars, focusing on three relations affecting equation of state inferences. Biases are significant under specific conditions but negligible in others, emphasizing the need for cautious application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess potential biases from commonly used quasi-universal relations in gravitational-wave studies to ensure accurate equation of state measurements with third-generation detectors.

Method: The study analyzes three quasi-universal relations: Love-Q relation, fundamental mode frequency-tidal deformability relation, and binary-Love relation. It evaluates their biases in different scenarios like spin-induced quadrupole moments, tidal parameters, and low-mass systems.

Result: Results show significant biases in Love-Q relation for rapidly rotating systems, moderate biases in binary-Love relation affecting low-mass equation of state inferences, and negligible biases from fundamental mode frequency relations. Waveform systematic effects are noted as larger for fundamental mode frequencies.

Conclusion: Quasi-universal relations remain useful but require careful application to avoid biases in future high-precision equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can shed light on the currently unknown dense matter equation of state. The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors.

*Alibordi Muhammad*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper addresses the incompatibility between CP violation and diffeomorphism invariance in general relativity, proposing an information-geometric framework using relative entropy and quantum states in Hilbert spaces to reinterpret the Sakharov conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the tension between CP violation's standard model and general covariance, which arises due to the preferred time foliation in effective Hamiltonian approaches and the ill-defined nature of phases near high curvature regions.

Method: Proposes an information-geometric framework based on relative entropy between pure quantum states in particle and antiparticle Hilbert spaces to re-express the Sakharov conditions without relying on non-covariant structures.

Result: Demonstrates how the Sakharov conditions can be formulated using information-geometric quantities, though a full phenomenological implementation is still in progress.

Conclusion: The framework offers a covariant alternative to current CP violation models but requires further development for complete application.

Abstract: We identify a fundamental tension between the standard formulation of CP violation and diffeomorphism invariance in general relativity. The effective Hamiltonian approach, while phenomenologically successful, relies on a preferred time foliation that is incompatible with general covariance. The CP-violating phases are scalars along the worldline of the decaying parent particle; however, the definition of masses and phases presupposes a local covariant structure, which becomes ill-defined near the origin where curvature is large and metric fluctuations become significant. We propose an information-geometric framework based on relative entropy, exploiting pure quantum states in particle and antiparticle Hilbert spaces. We show how the Sakharov conditions could be reinterpreted in terms of information-geometric quantities, although a fully rigorous phenomenological implementation remains to be developed.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper generalizes a previous theorem about FLRW spacetime in generic metric gravity theories by including scalar and vector fields, showing that even with these matter fields, the field equations reduce to Einstein's equations with an effective perfect fluid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the applicability of the previous theorem beyond vacuum conditions to include scalar and vector fields, ensuring the framework's robustness across different matter field scenarios.

Method: 1. Start with generic metric gravity theories incorporating scalar and vector fields.
2. Derive the field equations under these conditions.
3. Show equivalence to Einstein's equations with an effective perfect fluid.
4. Validate using recently developed Einstein-scalar and Einstein-Proca theories.

Result: The analysis confirms that even with scalar and vector fields, the field equations align with Einstein's framework with effective fluids, validated through specific examples.

Conclusion: The generalized theorem strengthens the connection between generic gravity theories and general relativity, offering a unified approach to analyzing various matter fields in cosmological contexts.

Abstract: We generalize our previous theorem for FLRW spacetime within the framework of generic metric gravity theories. In our earlier work, we demonstrated that, in the absence of matter fields, the field equations of any generic gravity theory reduce to the Einstein field equations with an effective perfect fluid source. In the present study, we extend this analysis by incorporating scalar and vector fields into a generic gravity theory and show that the resulting field equations remain equivalent to the Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid distribution. We further verify our findings by explicitly examining recently developed Einstein-scalar and Einstein-Proca field theories.

### [20] [Tarnished by Tools: Cost of Systematics in Golden Dark Siren Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14898)
*Giovanni Benetti,Koustav Chandra,Bangalore S. Sathyaprakash*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Golden dark sirens, gravitational-wave sources without electromagnetic counterparts, can precisely measure the Hubble constant (H₀) with next-gen detectors, but waveform model inaccuracies and calibration errors may introduce biases in distance, galaxy localization, and H₀ inference. This study highlights the need for improved waveform models and detector calibration to achieve sub-percent H₀ accuracy in future observations


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of waveform model systematics on H₀ measurements using golden dark sirens, ensuring that systematic errors don't outweigh statistical uncertainties in next-gen detector eras.

Method: Analyzes synthetic binary black hole populations using state-of-the-art waveform models compared to numerical relativity references. Quantifies biases in luminosity distance, host galaxy association, and H₀ inference from waveform inaccuracies, and derives calibration accuracy requirements for XG detectors.

Result: Current waveform models yield statistically consistent H₀ posteriors but show biases in 3D localization and host galaxy rankings, risking incorrect redshifts. Detector calibration must meet O(ρ⁻²) accuracy scales with signal-to-noise ratio for sub-percent H₀ precision.

Conclusion: Achieving sub-percent H₀ measurements via golden dark sirens requires waveform and calibration advancements scaling with SNR², emphasizing the need for continued improvements in numerical relativity, waveform modeling, and detector tech for XG-era cosmology.

Abstract: Golden dark sirens - exceptionally well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts - offer a powerful route to precision measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with next-generation (XG) detectors. The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\mathcal{O}(ρ^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era.

TL;DR: The paper explores Gödel-like solutions in Galilean gravity using a five-dimensional manifold, deriving exact solutions for rotating non-relativistic universes free of closed timelike curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend non-relativistic gravity frameworks by constructing exact solutions in Galilean gravity that avoid pathologies like closed timelike curves, ensuring physically viable rotating spacetime models.

Method: Adopting a Gödel-like metric ansatz in a 5D Galilean manifold, coupling to a Galilean fluid via variational principle, solving nonlinear field equations by fixing the matter sector consistently.

Result: Exact solutions describing rotating non-relativistic universes where D(x) > H(x) everywhere, ensuring the Killing vector remains spacelike and no CTCs form.

Conclusion: Galilean gravity can support rotating cosmological solutions free of closed timelike curves, demonstrating viability of non-relativistic geometric gravity frameworks for cosmological modeling.

Abstract: The article deals with Gödel-like solutions in the context of Galilean gravity, a geometric formulation of non-relativistic gravitation defined on a five-dimensional Galilean manifold. Within this framework, non-relativistic matter fields admit a covariant description, while the physical Newtonian dynamics is recovered through an immersion into the usual $3+1$ spacetime. By adopting a Gödel-like metric ansatz and coupling the gravitational field to a Galilean fluid derived from a variational principle, we obtain a system of highly nonlinear and coupled field equations. Exact solutions are constructed by fixing the matter sector consistently with the field equations. The resulting configurations describe rotating non-relativistic universes and satisfy $D(x)>H(x)$ throughout the entire spatial domain. As a consequence, the associated Killing vector remains spacelike everywhere and no closed timelike curves arise.

### [22] [Constraining Binary Neutron Star Populations using Short Gamma-Ray Burst Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13391)
*Alessio Ludovico De Santis,Samuele Ronchini,Filippo Santoliquido,Marica Branchesi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of 64 BNS population models shows that low local BNS merger rates (~50 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹) cannot explain the observed sGRB population unless jets are wider than observed. Higher rates (~100 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹) with realistic jet geometries align with Fermi-GBM data, strengthening BNS mergers as primary sGRB progenitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if BNS mergers alone can account for all observed short GRBs, given the limited GW detections, by comparing modeled BNS rates and jet geometries against sGRB observations.

Method: 64 BNS population models were simulated using Monte Carlo methods, considering three jet geometries (structured jet like GW170817, universal top-hat, non-universal top-hat). Results were compared to 16 years of Fermi-GBM sGRB data.

Result: Low BNS merger rates (<50 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹) predict insufficient sGRBs unless jets are abnormally wide (≥15°), conflicting with observed narrow jets (~6°). Models with ~100 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹ rates match observations with realistic jet angles.

Conclusion: BNS mergers with higher local rates are necessary to explain sGRB populations, highlighting the importance of combining GW and electromagnetic data for constraining astrophysical models.

Abstract: The landmark multi-messenger observations of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 provided firm evidence that such mergers can produce short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, the limited number of BNS detections by current gravitational-wave (GW) observatories raises the question of whether BNS mergers alone can account for the full observed sGRB population. We analyze a comprehensive set of 64 BNS population synthesis models with a Monte Carlo-based framework to reproduce the properties of sGRBs detected by Fermi-GBM over the past 16 years. We consider three jet geometry scenarios: a universal structured jet calibrated to GW170817, a universal top-hat jet, and a non-universal top-hat jet with distributions of core opening angles. Our results show that models characterized by low local BNS merger rates ($R_{BNS}(0) \lesssim 50$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) predict too few observable sGRBs to reproduce the Fermi-GBM population, effectively disfavoring them as sole progenitors. Even when relaxing assumptions on jet geometry, low-rate models remain viable only for wide jets ($θ_c \ge 15^\circ$), in tension with the narrow jet cores ($θ_c \approx 6^\circ$) inferred from sGRB afterglow observations. In contrast, models with local merger rates of order $R_{BNS}(0) \approx 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ successfully reproduce the observed sGRB population, assuming a plausible fraction of BNS mergers launch relativistic jets and realistic jet geometries. This analysis highlights the power of combining GW observations of BNS mergers with electromagnetic observations of sGRBs to place robust constraints on the BNS merger population and to assess their role as progenitors of sGRBs.

TL;DR: LHAASO's three-year monitoring of Mrk421 reveals 23 VHE outbursts with a 14% flaring occupancy, showing significant X-ray/TeV correlation and two emission modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically monitor blazar outbursts using LHAASO's high sensitivity and continuous observation capabilities, enabling insights into emission mechanisms through multiwavelength analysis.

Method: Three-year LHAASO observations (0.4-20 TeV) combined with Fermi-LAT, MAXI-GSC, Swift-XRT, and ZTF data for multiwavelength correlation analysis. Outburst detection via daily significance thresholds and spectral modeling of SEDs.

Result: Mrk421 remained quiescent in 2021, became active in 2022 with 23 outbursts (peak 3.3 CU at 20σ). X-ray/TeV strongly correlated without lag; GeV/TeV correlation weaker. Quiescent vs active states show distinct TeV flux distributions.

Conclusion: LHAASO's sustained monitoring reveals blazar jet emission's dual-mode behavior. Findings support different energy dissipation mechanisms for quiescent/active states and highlight the importance of multiwavelength campaigns for understanding AGN variability.

Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) monitors sources within its field of view for up to 7 hours daily, achieving a duty cycle exceeding 98% and an annual point-source sensitivity of 1.5% Crab Units (CU) in the very high energy (VHE) band. This unbiased sky-survey mode facilitates systematic monitoring and investigation of outburst phenomena. In this paper, we present results from an unprecedented three-year monitoring campaign (March 2021--March 2024) of Mrk421 using LHAASO, spanning energies from 0.4 TeV to 20 TeV. We find that the blazar stayed in a quiescent state in 2021 and became active starting in 2022 with a total of 23 VHE outburst events identified, where the highest observed daily significance reaches $20\,σ$ with a flux equivalent to approximately 3.3~CU. LHAASO's continuous monitoring suggests the flaring occupancy of Mrk~421 to be around 14%. During long-term monitoring, multiwavelength (MWL) variability and correlation analyses are conducted using complementary data from Fermi-LAT, MAXI-GSC, Swift-XRT, and ZTF. A significant correlation ($>3\,σ$) is observed between X-ray and VHE bands with no detectable time lag, while the correlation between GeV and TeV bands is weaker. The flux distribution of the TeV emission during the quiescent state is different from that in the active state, implying the existence of two modes of energy dissipation in the blazar jet. Using simultaneous MWL data, we also analyzed both the long-term and outburst-period SEDs, and discussed the possible origin of the outburst events.

### [24] [Searching for Neutron Star Mergers in the Absence of Gravitational Waves with Optical Afterglow Emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13471)
*Haille M. L. Perkins,Gautham Narayan,Brian D. Fields,Ved G. Shah,Genevieve Schroeder*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study evaluates the potential of using bright short gamma-ray burst afterglows to enhance kilonova (KN) detection rates with the Rubin Observatory's LSST survey, increasing expectations from ~30 to ~90 per year. It emphasizes the necessity of multi-wavelength strategies for detecting neutron star mergers without gravitational-wave triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With no new neutron star mergers detected in the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA run, the intrinsic event rate is lower than expected, making KN sample building difficult. Complementary methods independent of gravitational-wave triggers are needed to improve detection rates.

Method: The authors analyze the impact of on-axis gamma-ray burst afterglows ($θ_{\rm view} ≤ 30°$) on KN detectability in LSST's $g$-band observations, quantifying rate enhancements and using color diagnostics to differentiate KN-emitting mergers from others.

Result: KN detection rates in LSST's $g$-band increase from $29^{+51}_{-21} \ \rm yr^{-1}$ to $91^{+160}_{-65} \ \rm yr^{-1}$ with gamma-ray afterglow guidance. Color analysis can distinguish between KN-emitting and non- or weak- KN merger types.

Conclusion: Multi-wavelength observations are critical for detecting rare neutron star mergers post-gravitational-wave era. LSST's capabilities enable timely detection and follow-up, but uncertainties like merger rates and explosion parameters remain key challenges.

Abstract: With the forth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave network, which enabled the discovery of the kilonova (KN) counterpart to GW170817, ending with no new confirmed neutron star mergers, the intrinsic rate of these events must be even lower than previously estimated. As a result, building a sample of KNe will remain challenging even with continued GW observations, motivating complementary discovery strategies that do not rely on gravitational-wave triggers. In this work, we consider how leveraging bright short gamma-ray burst afterglows can aid in the discovery on KNe with the Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), whose unprecedented depth will make such detections feasible. We find that nearly on-axis ($θ_{\rm view} \leq 30°$) afterglows can enhance KN detection rates in the LSST $g$-band from $29^{+51}_{-21} \ \rm yr^{-1}$ to $91^{+160}_{-65} \ \rm yr^{-1}$. We further show how the colors of the observed events can be used to distinguish between neutron star merger counterparts with and without KN emission. This study demonstrates how critical multi-wavelength and multi-survey observations are for these rare events, especially without context from gravitational waves. Fortunately, detectable events will likely be discovered near peak with LSST, allowing for rapid follow-up and confirmation. We discuss key uncertainties in our study, particularly volume rate of merger events, and the degeneracy between the empirically determined explosion energy and ambient medium density.

### [25] [Superorbital Phase Evolution and a Soft-Hard X-ray Phase Shift in LMC X-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13491)
*Yi Chou*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes 33 years of X-ray data from LMC X-4, revealing a stable superorbital period with systematic fluctuations. The sinusoidal model identifies an ~8900-day modulation, suggesting disk dynamics rather than orbital effects. Phase offsets between X-ray bands indicate disk structure changes, linking LMC X-4 to Her X-1's anomalous low state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to understand the stability and variability of LMC X-4's superorbital period in the context of its binary system dynamics, particularly testing hypotheses about orbital tertiary companions and disk geometry.

Method: Analysis of multi-mission X-ray/gamma-ray monitoring data (CGRO BATSE, RXTE ASM, Swift BAT, MAXI GSC, Fermi GBM). Applied models include cubic, quartic, and sinusoidal fits to phase data, with disk structure modeling for band-dependent phase shifts.

Result: Long-term stability of superorbital period (~0.55% variation over 33 years) with sinusoidal modulation (~8900 days). Phase offset between soft/hard X-rays observed near MJD 57000-60461, explained by higher-harmonic disk structures. Stochastic fluctuations on 100-1000 day timescales inconsistent with orbital tertiary companions.

Conclusion: Superorbital period variations arise from internal disk dynamics rather than orbital perturbations. The phase-shift observations provide evidence for evolving disk structures, extending the connection between LMC X-4 and Her X-1's phenomena to disk geometry changes during partial obscuration events.

Abstract: The superorbital period of LMC X-4 is among the most stable known in Roche-lobe overflow, high-mass X-ray binaries. We analyzed 33 years of monitoring data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory Burst and Transient Source Experiment (CGRO BATSE), the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor (RXTE ASM), the Neil Gehrels Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift BAT), the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image Gas Slit Camera (MAXI GSC), and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi GBM). The measured phases show a smooth long-term trend with superposed systematic fluctuations. Fits with cubic, quartic, and sinusoidal models indicate that the quartic and sinusoidal forms provide significantly better descriptions, with the sinusoidal model yielding an $8900^{+210}_{-230}$-day modulation. Such a long timescale is unlikely to arise from orbital motion around a tertiary companion. The fluctuations resemble stochastic, glitch-like events on several-hundred-day timescales. Their rms period variation exceeds that of the smooth trend, yet the total rms period variation over 33 years remains only 0.55\%, demonstrating the exceptional stability of the superorbital period. During MJD 57000-60461, we detect a phase offset of 0.044$\pm$0.010 cycles between the soft and hard X-ray bands. This offset can be reproduced by including a higher-harmonic term in the azimuthal disk model, allowing a transition from antisymmetric to asymmetric structure. A contemporaneous decline in the hard X-ray flux suggests a partial obscuration of the emission region, similar to the anomalous low state in Her X-1. This evolving-disk scenario may also explain the superorbital phase shift previously reported in Her X-1.

### [26] [Pulsars and Millisecond Pulsars III: Tracing Compact Object Dynamics in Globular Clusters with NBODY6++GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13688)
*M. Rah,R. Spurzem,F. Flammini Dotti,A. Mickaelian*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of pulsar spin evolution and magnetic field decay in direct N-body simulations like NBODY6++GPU. It presents a case study of a neutron star's evolution over 200 Myr and proposes a seven-scenario framework to integrate pulsar physics into simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between stellar dynamics simulations and pulsar evolution by incorporating factors like magnetic dipole spin-down, field decay, and environmental effects, enabling more accurate modeling of neutron star behavior in globular clusters.

Method: Analysis of an existing N-body simulation (N=105,000) tracking a neutron star's evolution without pulsar physics. Proposes integrating seven evolutionary scenarios into NBODY6++GPU using existing components (Hermite scheme, BSE stellar evolution) and introduces mathematical models for pulsar parameters.

Result: Demonstrates the feasibility of integrating pulsar evolution into simulations through a case study (e.g., Pulsar973 with mass loss from 5.35 to 2.52 M☉). Highlights missing data (period, magnetic field) and the need for scenario-specific parameters.

Conclusion: Calls for implementing the proposed framework to enhance N-body simulations, improving understanding of neutron star formation and evolution in globular clusters through combined stellar dynamics and pulsar physics tracking.

Abstract: Neutron stars in globular clusters follow complex evolutionary pathways shaped by binary interactions, mass transfer, and dynamical exchanges. Direct N-body simulations such as NBODY6++GPU successfully model stellar dynamics and compact object formation, but they usually do not track pulsar spin evolution or magnetic field decay explicitly. Building on Papers I and II of this series, we identify this gap and present a case study from an existing simulation with N = 105000 particles, showing how a neutron star forms and evolves for 200 Myr without any pulsar-physics tracking. We compare this situation with recent implementations and outline a seven-scenario framework that includes magnetic dipole spin-down, exponential magnetic field decay, environmental torques, accretion-driven spin-up, gravitational-wave emission, and merger-driven evolution. As an example, the neutron star we label Pulsar973 forms at t = 800 Myr with a post-supernova mass of 5.35 solar masses and evolves to 2.52 solar masses by t = 1000 Myr, but still lacks period P, period derivative Pdot, magnetic field B, and scenario classification. We provide mathematical formulations and specific integration points within NBODY6++GPU (Hermite scheme, Ahmad-Cohen neighbors, KS regularization, and BSE stellar evolution) to enable scenario-based pulsar evolution within direct N-body simulations.

### [27] [Detection of Cyclotron Absorption in the Radio Emission of GPM 1839-10](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13742)
*Yunpeng Men,Ewan Barr,Yuanhong Qu,Csanad Horvath,Jinchen Jiang,Gregory Desvignes,Natasha Hurley-Walker,Michael Kramer,Rui Luo,Samuel J. McSweeney,Jason Wu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of GPM 1839-10 using FAST telescope observations reveals consistent OPM switch-polarized intensity correlations, stable Rotation Measures, and a cyclotron absorption feature indicating a magnetic field strength of tens of Gauss, supporting a weakly magnetized companion scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the peculiar emission mechanisms and magneto-ionic environment of the long-period radio transient GPM 1839-10 through follow-up observations.

Method: Conducted L-band observations with the FAST telescope, detected seven radio pulses, analyzed OPM switches' relation to polarized intensity changes, compared Rotation Measures (RMs) with historical data, and identified a cyclotron absorption feature.

Result: Found OPM switches associated with polarized intensity decreases, consistent RMs suggesting stable environment, and first detection of cyclotron absorption feature implying a magnetic field lower limit of tens of Gauss.

Conclusion: The observations support that OPM switches arise from incoherent OPM summation and suggest GPM 1839-10 may be part of a binary system with a weakly magnetized companion.

Abstract: GPM 1839-10 is an intriguing long-period radio transient (LPT), distinguished by its activity spanning at least three decades and its highly unusual emission characteristics. These features include orthogonal polarization mode (OPM) switches, down-drifting sub-structures, and distinct linear-to-circular polarization conversion behaviors. In this work, we present follow-up observations utilizing the FAST telescope at L-band, yielding a total of seven detected radio pulses. We find a consistent association between OPM switches and a decrease in polarized intensity. This feature strongly supports the hypothesis that the OPM switches are generated by the incoherent summation of OPMs. Our measured Rotation Measures (RMs) are consistent with previous observations, indicating that the magneto-ionic environment is stable. If the source is in a binary system, such stability suggests it may host a weakly magnetized companion. Crucially, we firstly observe clear evidence of a cyclotron absorption feature in one radio pulse, a signature rarely observed in radio sources. This feature allows us to infer that the magnetic field strength at the absorption site has a lower limit of tens of Gauss, which is necessary for the phenomenon to occur. This characteristic can be explained in a scenario where GPM 1839-10 possesses a weakly magnetized companion star.

### [28] [Dust and Ices in the SNR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13754)
*A. Yeghikyan,M. Rah,S. Shamyar*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the presence of dust and water ice in supernova remnants (SNRs) using infrared data from Spitzer, Herschel, and JWST, along with Cloudy modeling. It finds potential water ice in IC 443 and other SNRs like the Crab Nebula and N49, but notes the 63 μm emission might also be [OI] line. Theoretical models suggest water ice survival under specific SNR conditions, emphasizing the need for further observational and simulation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ambiguity in interpreting infrared emissions from SNRs. Prior data suggests dust exists, but the origin and composition of certain spectral features (e.g., 63 μm) remain unclear. Understanding whether ices (like water) form in these extreme environments could clarify cosmic dust budgets and evolution.

Method: The method combines observational analysis of IR data from multiple telescopes (Spitzer, Herschel, JWST) targeting SNRs like Crab Nebula, N49, and IC 443. The 62-63 μm spectral range is examined for ice signatures. The Cloudy photoionization code is used to model dust/ice survival under SNR conditions, simulating density-temperature regimes.

Result: Observations show possible water ice in IC 443, but the 63 μm feature is ambiguous between ice and [OI] emission. Models indicate water ice could survive in SNR environments if shielded from UV radiation, depending on density and temperature parameters. No definitive confirmation achieved, highlighting uncertainties.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while water ice可能存在 in SNRs, more data and simulations are essential. It underscores the importance of distinguishing ice features from emission lines and improving models of ice survival in harsh SNR conditions to better understand interstellar dust origins.

Abstract: The presence of dust in supernova remnants (SNRs) is confirmed by extensive infrared data from observatories such as Spitzer, Herschel, and JWST, alongside theoretical models of dust formation. This study explores the existence of dust and ices, particularly water ice via 62 μm in SNRs such as the Crab Nebula and N49, using observational data and preliminary modeling with Cloudy. Observations suggest that water ice may be present in IC 443 and possibly other remnants, though the 63 μm band could also indicate [OI] emission. Theoretical models indicate that water ice could survive under certain conditions in SNRs, with densities and temperatures analyzed. Further observations and refined simulations are needed to confirm these findings.

*A. Yeghikyan,M. Rah,S. Shamyar,S. Khachatryan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses 2D simulations to show that supernova shocks compress interstellar clouds into dense structures, creating conditions conducive to water ice formation despite high temperatures, suggesting such environments can support ice formation when considering radiative cooling and grain chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the presence of water ice in supernova remnants where extreme conditions were thought to prevent dust survival.

Method: Two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations analyzing shock-cloud interactions in supernova remnants, focusing on cloud compression and temperature dynamics during the adiabatic phase.

Result: Simulations demonstrate shock compression forms dense structures similar to observed remnants; though temperatures remain high initially, radiative cooling could rapidly reduce temperatures, enabling ice formation. Future models need to incorporate cooling and grain chemistry.

Conclusion: Shock-cloud interactions likely create favorable conditions for water ice formation in supernova remnants, challenging prior assumptions about dust survival in such environments.

Abstract: Water ice has been detected in several supernova remnants despite the strong heating and radiation in these environments. This challenges standard expectations for dust survival. Using two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study how a supernova shock interacts with a dense interstellar cloud. The simulations show that the shock naturally compresses the cloud into dense structures similar to those inferred in well known remnants. Although temperatures remain high in the adiabatic phase, simple considerations indicate that cooling would act quickly once included. These results suggest that shock cloud interactions create the physical conditions needed for water ice to form. Future work including radiative cooling and grain surface chemistry will allow direct modelling of ice growth in these compressed regions.

### [30] [Estimatingthe Contribution of Galactic Neutrino Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13815)
*Mohadeseh Ozlati Moghadam,Kathrin Egberts,Rowan Batzofin,Constantin Steppa,Elisa Bernardini*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper estimates the source component of the Galactic neutrino flux using simulations of gamma-ray sources and compares it with observations, finding that the propagated cosmic-ray interactions plus minimum source contributions align well with observed neutrino fluxes, limiting additional contributions from cosmic-ray propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the contribution of cosmic-ray interactions at their acceleration sites (source component) versus those during propagation through the interstellar medium (ISM) to the observed Galactic neutrino flux.

Method: Simulated populations of Galactic TeV gamma-ray sources were used with a bracketing approach, where upper and lower limits for the source component were estimated using full gamma-ray source populations and supernova remnant hadronic components, respectively.

Result: The neutrino flux range from the source component is within an order of magnitude and comparable to the propagation component. Combined with the minimum source contribution (SNR model), it nearly matches observed fluxes, leaving little room for enhancement from cosmic-ray propagation.

Conclusion: The observed neutrino flux is plausibly explained by the combined source and propagation components, suggesting limited additional contributions from cosmic-ray interactions in the ISM beyond what's already modeled.

Abstract: The Milky Way hosts astrophysical accelerators capable of producing high-energy cosmic rays. These cosmic rays can interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) across the Galaxy to produce neutrinos and gamma rays (propagation component), while their interactions with ambient material at their acceleration sites, such as supernova remnants, can give rise to the source component of the gamma-ray and neutrino flux. In this paper, we estimate the source component of the Galactic neutrino flux using simulated populations of Galactic gamma-ray sources. We compare our results with observations from neutrino experiments in the energy range of 1-30 TeV. Using simulated populations of Galactic TeV gamma-ray sources, we exploit the correlation between gamma rays and neutrinos and introduce a bracketing approach to constrain the range for the source contribution of the Galactic neutrino flux. For the upper limit, we used a simulation describing the entity of Galactic gamma-ray sources, whereas the lower limit was estimated using the hadronic component of the Galactic supernova remnant population. Our results show that the difference between this maximum and minimum is less than an order of magnitude and the flux range is comparable to the Galactic neutrino flux from the cosmic-ray interaction with the ISM. The results agree with the observed signals from IceCube and ANTARES and suggest that the propagation component, combined with the minimum source contribution predicted by the supernova-remnant model, approaches the observed neutrino flux, leaving little room for significant enhancements of the emission originating from propagating cosmic rays.

*Kuo Liu,Siyuan Chen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have made significant advances in detecting nanohertz gravitational waves, achieving evidence of the Hellings-Downs correlation, marking a pivotal step toward confirming a gravitational-wave background and opening a new observational window.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To review progress in PTA technology, data-analysis methods, and theoretical understanding that have collectively advanced the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves, culminating in potential breakthroughs.

Method: Overview presentation of PTA experiments, highlighting instrumental improvements, advanced data techniques, and theoretical insights leading to the identification of common red-noise processes and Hellings-Downs correlations in pulsar data.

Result: PTAs have improved sensitivity, yielding tighter upper limits on the GWB and providing first evidence of Hellings-Downs correlations, strongly indicating a GWB. This positions PTAs on the verge of a confident GW detection.

Conclusion: PTAs are at a critical juncture in gravitational-wave astronomy, poised to establish the first confident detection of nanohertz GWs and enable a new low-frequency observational era.

Abstract: The past decade has been a transformative period for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and their search for nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). This progress has been driven by collective advances in instrumentation for pulsar timing observations, increasingly sophisticated data-analysis techniques, and improved theoretical understanding of the origins of nanohertz GW signals. PTA sensitivity has steadily improved, leading first to progressively more stringent upper limits on the gravitational-wave background (GWB), and subsequently to the identification of a common red-noise process in pulsar timing data, the first hint of a GWB. In 2023, multiple PTA collaborations reported evidence for the Hellings-Downs correlation, widely regarded as the definitive signature of a GWB. These developments place PTAs on the threshold of a confident GW detection and the opening of a new low-frequency window on the GW Universe. In this article, we present an overview of PTA experiments, with particular emphasis on the rapid progress achieved during this pivotal period for PTA and nanohertz GW science.

### [32] [Kinematic Evidence for Open Cluster Origins of Galactic Binary Neutron Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14145)
*Wen-Jie Yu,Lu Zhou,Zhi-Qiang You,Hao Ding,Lu Li,Long Wang,Xing-Jiang Zhu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses Gaia DR3 data to trace the past trajectories of BNSs and clusters, finding open clusters like Theia 58 as more plausible birthplaces than globular clusters, with the Double Pulsar having a 13.9% chance originating from Theia 58.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if Galactic BNS systems originated from globular or open clusters by analyzing their kinematic histories.

Method: Kinematic analysis using Gaia DR3 astrometry, updated pulsar distances, and Monte Carlo sampling of errors to trace trajectories of 11 BNSs and 3000+ clusters, evaluating past encounters.

Result: Low encounter probabilities with globular clusters (e.g., <0.5% for NGC 5139) but significant 13.9% probability for Double Pulsar's origin in open cluster Theia 58.

Conclusion: Open clusters are a non-negligible formation channel for some BNSs, providing kinematic evidence supporting their role in BNS birthplaces.

Abstract: We investigate the potential birthplace of Galactic binary neutron star (BNS) systems through a kinematic analysis. Using high-precision astrometry from Gaia DR3, updated pulsar distances, and Monte Carlo sampling of astrometric errors, we integrate the past trajectories of 11 Galactic BNSs and 167 globular clusters plus 2967 open clusters, to search for past encounters. Our results suggest that BNS origin in globular clusters is unlikely, with low encounter probabilities (e.g., $\lesssim 0.5\%$ for NGC 5139) and requiring excessive ejection velocities. Conversely, our analysis indicates that open clusters are a non-negligible formation channel. Specifically, the double pulsar J0737$-$3039 shows a $13.9\%$ ($5.4\%$) probability of originating from the young cluster OC 0450 (Theia 58). Based on encounter proximity and time, we argue that Theia 58 is its more plausible birthplace. Our work provides kinematic evidence consistent with an open-cluster origin for a subset of field BNSs.

*Andrea Goldwurm,Maïca Clavel,Stefano Gabici,Régis Terrier*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper reviews high-energy emissions from the Galactic Center, focusing on the role of Sgr A* and other processes in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), including unresolved questions about feedback mechanisms and SMBH activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical phenomena in the Galactic Center's extreme environment, where Sgr A* resides, and its impact on galactic evolution through feedback processes. The complexity of high-energy emissions and unanswered questions necessitate further study.

Method: Review of observational results from X-ray and gamma-ray observatories over the past 25 years, analyzing sources like compact objects, diffuse components, and outflows, particularly their interaction within the CMZ.

Result: Highlights the complexity of Galactic Center emissions (thermal/non-thermal, compact/extended/diffuse sources) and their connections to polar structures via outflows. The SMBH's current and past activity is a key factor but remains partially unresolved.

Conclusion: The Galactic Center offers insights into SMBH feedback and galactic evolution, yet open issues persist. Future studies must address SMBH's role, emission mechanisms in the CMZ, and connections between nuclear activity and galaxy-scale structures.

Abstract: The center of the Galaxy is a prominent source in X-rays and gamma-rays. The study of its high-energy (HE) emission is crucial in understanding the physical phenomena taking place in this dense and extreme environment, where the closest supermassive black hole (SMBH) to us, Sgr A*, is lurking nearly invisible, today, in most of the energy spectrum. These phenomena are probably common to other galactic nuclei and may explain the feedback processes between nuclear regions and galaxies, so important for the overall evolution of the Universe. The Galactic center HE emission is very complex and consists of both thermal and non thermal radiation produced by compact and extended sources, surrounded by more diffuse components. All these objects and media are interacting with each other in the narrow and dense Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Some of them also show relevant extensions towards the Galactic poles, indicating energetic outflows that seem to link the center to the recently observed large Galactic polar structures. In spite of the fundamental advances obtained in the last twenty five years with the most sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray observatories, several questions remain open to investigations. We review here the main observational results and the open issues on the high-energy diagnostics of the Galactic nuclear activity, focusing on processes that take place in the CMZ, and in particular discussing the role of the present and past SMBH activities in powering this region and possibly the whole Galaxy.

*Han-Xiang Hu,Xing-Jian Lv,Xiao-Jun Bi,Tian-Lu Chen,Kun Fang,Peng-Fei Yin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents a self-consistent nonlinear model of cosmic ray acceleration at supernova remnants, incorporating CR feedback on shock dynamics and a momentum-dependent escape mechanism to explain the observed proton spectrum's hardening and cutoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in previous models where precursor dynamics and escape mechanisms were treated separately, and to explain the DAMPE proton spectrum features like gradual hardening and an exponential cutoff at tens of TeV.

Method: Develops a nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration model including CR backreaction on shock precursor, thermal leakage injection, and a momentum-dependent loss term for escape. The precursor compression ratio is determined dynamically through feedback between injection and shock modification, including CR-driven heating.

Result: The model reproduces the DAMPE spectrum's gradual hardening from GeV to TeV energies and an exponential cutoff at ~10 TeV, showing spectral evolution arises from the interplay between precursor feedback and escape effects.

Conclusion: The combined effects of nonlinear shock modification and upstream escape naturally explain the proton spectrum features observed by DAMPE, validating the self-consistent model over previous simplifications.

Abstract: We develop a self-consistent nonlinear extension of diffusive shock acceleration that incorporates cosmic ray (CR) backreaction on the shock precursor together with a physically motivated upstream-escape mechanism that produces an exponential high energy cutoff. The CR pressure gradient decelerates the upstream flow facing the shock wave, generating an extended precursor in which higher rigidity particles sample a larger cumulative velocity gradient and thereby acquire a progressively harder spectrum. Finite-size/escape effects are modeled by a momentum-dependent loss term, which naturally terminates acceleration and steepens the spectrum near the cutoff. The precursor compression ratio is not imposed as a closure condition but is determined dynamically by requiring consistency between the injection rate inferred from thermal leakage at the subshock and the injection strength demanded by the nonlinear shock modification, with CR-driven wave heating providing stabilizing negative feedback. Applying the model to young supernova-remnant-like parameters and standard one-zone Galactic diffusion, we reproduce the main features of the latest DAMPE proton spectrum: gradual hardening from hundreds of GeV to multi-TeV energies and a subsequent exponential cutoff at tens of TeV. The resulting spectral evolution follows directly from the competition between precursor-mediated nonlinear feedback and upstream escape.

*Dilip Kumar Roy,Samuzal Barua,Ranjeev Misra,Rathin Sarma,V. Jithesh*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The first detection of Fe K relativistic reverberation in Ton S180 reveals a black hole spin of 0.3–0.6 and mass of ~3×10^7 solar masses, consistent with a lag-mass relation in Seyfert galaxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study black hole spin and mass using relativistic reverberation mapping of Fe K lines in Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, and validate lag-based mass scaling relations.

Method: Analyzed 1.1 Ms XMM-Newton X-ray observations, measured Fe K line lags across 0.3–30×10^-4 Hz frequencies, performed relativistic transfer function modeling of lag spectra, and compared results with reflection modeling and existing lag-mass relations.

Result: Detected Fe K lag peak at 117±49 s at lower frequencies, reduced to 22.85±14.20 s at higher frequencies. Spin estimates from timing (a=0.30) and reflection models (a=0.43) align. Black hole mass (0.29×10^8 M☉) matches previous measurements. Observed consistent lag-mass correlation with other Seyferts.

Conclusion: Reverberation mapping of Fe K lines provides independent spin and mass estimates, validating timing techniques and supporting unified models of active galactic nuclei mechanics.

Abstract: We report the Fe K relativistic reverberation feature for the first time in the Narrow-line Seyfert\,1 galaxy Ton\,S180. Using a long observation from {\it XMM-Newton} we find that the Fe K emission lag peaks at $117\pm49$ s in the lag energy spectrum computed for frequencies $(0.3-8.5) \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $22.85\pm14.20$ s as the frequency increases to $(8.5-30) \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The time-averaged spectrum of the source shows a relatively narrow Fe K line at $\sim6.4$ keV, resulting in black hole spin to be low ($a=\rm 0.43_{-0.14}^{+0.10}$) found from the reflection modelling. We perform general relativistic transfer function modelling of the lag energy spectra individually. This provides an independent timing-based measure of the spin at $a=0.30_{-0.17}^{+0.34}$, and black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = 0.29_{-0.16}^{+0.01}\times10^8M_{\odot}$, comparable to the previous measurement, and height of the corona $h = 2.59_{-0.33}^{+5.17}r_{\rm g}$. Further, we observe that the Fe K lag and the black hole mass fit well in the linear lag-mass relation shown by other Seyfert 1 galaxies.

### [36] [PeV neutrons as origin of separated SS433 TeV signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14212)
*D. Fargion,P. G. De Sanctis Lucentini,S. Turriziani,M. Y. Khlopov,D. Sopin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper proposes that the observed far-separated TeV gamma-ray beams from SS433, detected by H.E.S.S., HAWC, and LHAASO, originate from the decay of relativistic neutron beams ejected in a past century-old eruption. The neutrons decay into TeV electrons, which produce gamma rays via Inverse Compton Scattering off interstellar photons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the unexpected far-separated (100 light-years) TeV gamma-ray emissions detected recently, which cannot be accounted for by standard accretion jet models.

Method: Proposes a model where century-old relativistic neutron beams (tens PeV) ejected from SS433 decay over time, with their beta decay products (electrons) generating TeV gamma rays via Inverse Compton Scattering at large distances.

Result: The model accounts for the observed TeV gamma traces at 100 light-years distance, linking them to historical eruptions and neutron decay processes.

Conclusion: The presence of far-separated TeV gamma emissions supports the hypothesis of past energetic eruptions in SS433, providing insights into long-term relativistic particle decay and cosmic-ray origins.

Abstract: The SS433, a well-known binary system with an internal black hole, have shown since half a century, an inner (a few year light distances) twin precessing jets spirals. These beams are made by tidal forces while stripping mass from large stellar companion feeding an inner BH accretion disk and an orthogonal accelerating twin jet. From it, the radio, X gamma jet emission. A couple of years ago H.E.S.S telescope as well as HAWC and LHAASO array detectors, discovered also the surprising signature of an unexpected far twin separated gamma beam at tens TeV energy. At a hundred light years distances from its central source. We suggest that it is the legacy of a past rare eruption, a century ago, of tens PeV (10^16 eV) relativistic twin neutron beams. Their beta decay in flight at far distances, into proton, neutrino and in particular into tens TeV electrons, could feed the observed TeV gamma traces. They are originated by the same secondary tens TeV electrons emitting hard gamma, by Inverse Compton Scattering onto interstellar infrared photons.

*Praveen Sharma,Maxim Lyutikov,Slava G. Turyshev,Maxim V. Barkov*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study shows that merging neutron stars create dual-jetted current outflows, similar to Alfvén wings in planetary interactions, which can enhance emission and produce observable precursor signals before the main gravitational wave event.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the electromagnetic phenomena and precursor emissions generated during the merger of neutron stars, particularly focusing on magnetospheric interactions and their observable signatures.

Method: 3D relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations modeling a conducting sphere passing through a highly magnetized plasma environment, simulating the interaction between merging neutron stars.

Result: The simulations reveal relativistic sub-Alfvénic interactions, electromagnetic draping leading to amplified magnetic fields, and the generation of beamed outflows. These outflows enhance pulsar-like radio and high-energy emissions, cause spin/orbital modulations, and predict precursor emissions before gravitational wave signals.

Conclusion: Dual-jetted current outflows from merging neutron stars' magnetospheric interactions are significant sources of observable electromagnetic emissions and precursor signals, providing new avenues for multi-messenger astrophysics studies.

Abstract: We demonstrate that magnetospheric interactions between merging neutron stars (NSs) generate dual-jetted current outflows, analogous to the Alfvén wings observed during planetary interactions in the Solar System. Using 3D relativistic MHD simulations, we model the interaction as a conducting sphere moving through a highly magnetized plasma of the companion's magnetosphere. Unusually, the interaction operates in a regime that is relativistic yet sub-Alfvénic. Electromagnetic draping amplifies magnetic fields in a narrow layer near the stellar surface, leading to the generation of electric currents along the local magnetic field. The generation of beamed outflows enhances instantaneous power of the pulsar-like radio and high energy emission, produces spin/orbital modulations, and is likely to lead to observable precursor emission preceding the main gravitational wave event.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper links quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in FRB 20240114A to neutron star crustal oscillations, using them to constrain the neutron star's mass (1.00–1.76 solar masses), radius (~13 km), and nuclear parameters like K₀ and L (59.5–96.8 MeV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To constrain neutron star properties and nuclear matter parameters using observable QPO frequencies from an extragalactic fast radio burst (FRB 20240114A) at redshift z≈0.13.

Method: Identify QPO frequencies (567.7 Hz or 655.5 Hz) as crustal torsional oscillation modes, apply constraints from nuclear matter incompressibility K₀, and model neutron star structure in the low-mass/low-central density regime.

Result: Mass range: 1.00–1.55 or 1.17–1.76 M☉ (depending on overtone choice), radius ≈13 km, slope parameter L=59.5–96.8 MeV. Results align with prior experimental/astronomical constraints.

Conclusion: Mapping FRB QPOs to neutron star crustal oscillations is feasible, with validation from future FRB surveys and data analyses across diverse redshifts.

Abstract: By identifying quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) reported in FRB 20240114A (from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope) with neutron star crustal torsional oscillations, together with experimental constraints on the incompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density, we constrain the mass and radius of an extragalactic neutron star at redshift $z\approx0.13$. Identifying the low-order QPO frequencies as fundamental oscillations, and frequencies of $567.7\,\mathrm{Hz}$ or $655.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (rest frame) as first overtone candidates, implies neutron star mass ranges of $1.00$--$1.55\,M_\odot$ or $1.17$--$1.76\,M_\odot$, respectively. The radius is also constrained, with a self-consistent value around $13$~km, further supported by the calculation of the NS structure within the low-mass/low-central density regime. Simultaneously, we also constrain another nuclear saturation parameter, namely the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density (i.e., the slope parameter), $L$, and determine it to be $L=59.5-96.8$ MeV with $\sim 10\%$ systematic uncertainty, which is broadly consistent with previous constraints on $L$ obtained from experiments and astronomical observations. Thus, a mapping of FRB QPOs to crustal torsional modes seems reasonable. This can be confirmed with upcoming FRB surveys over a broad range of redshifts and more elaborate data analyses.

### [39] [The Physical Properties of PS1-12sk and the Implications to Its Progenitor System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14427)
*Kai-Li Mi,Shan-Qin Wang,Wen-Pei Gan,Qiu-Ping Huang,Tao Wang,En-Wei Liang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: PS1-12sk, a type Ibn supernova found in a low star-forming environment, is analyzed using double white dwarf merger models. The CSI plus 56Ni model best fits its light curve, supporting a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion from low-mass WDs. The circumstellar medium likely originates from pre-merger flybys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the type Ibn nature of PS1-12sk in a quiescent host environment, which conflicts with the traditional massive star explosion scenario. The goal is to identify the progenitor system and explosion mechanism through modeling.

Method: Bolometric light curve (LC) fitting using ejecta-CSM interaction (CSI) and CSI plus 56Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) mergers. Derived WD masses, 56Ni mass, CSM properties, and explosion energetics.

Result: CSI model fails but CSI+56Ni model matches the LC. Derived masses: 0.70 M_sun (primary WD), 0.40 M_sun (secondary WD), 0.09 M_sun (56Ni). Ejecta mass is sub-Chandrasekhar (~0.98 M_sun). CSM properties suggest origin from pre-merger flybys, not the merger phase.

Conclusion: PS1-12sk likely results from a sub-Chandrasekhar WD merger. The 56Ni mass aligns with sub-Chandrasekhar models. CSM formation via pre-merger interactions resolves the circumstellar origin puzzle, challenging traditional massive star scenarios.

Abstract: PS1-12sk is a type Ibn supernova (SN) found at the host environment showing no obvious ongoing star formation, which challenges the massive star explosion scenario. We use the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction (CSI) and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) merger to fit the bolometric light curve (LC) of PS1-12sk, since the He emission lines at the photospheric phases indicated the interaction between the SN ejecta and He-rich CSM. We find that the CSI model failed to explain the LC, but the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the bolometric LC. The derived masses of the two WDs and $^{56}$Ni are $\sim 0.70 M_\odot$, $\sim 0.40 M_\odot$, and $\sim 0.09\,M_\odot$, respectively. The facts that the ejecta mass ($\sim 0.984 M_\odot$) is well below the Chandrasekhar limit ($\sim 1.4 M_\odot$) and that the $^{56}$Ni mass is comparable to the $^{56}$Ni yields of the explosions of some sub-Chandrasekhar explosion models support the scenario that PS1-12sk might be from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion induced by the merger of two low-mass WDs. The derived innermost radius ($\sim 13.81 \times 10^{12}$ cm) and the mass of the CSM ($\sim 0.116 M_\odot$) disfavor the possibility that the CSM was formed in the merger phase. We suggest that the flybys before the merger can account for the position and mass of the CSM.

*Ziyang Li,Shou-Qi Liu,Jia-Hui Huang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the radiative properties and optical appearance of rotating SV black holes with accretion disks, focusing on the regularization parameter g's effects. Results show that while kinematic quantities depend on g, radiative efficiency matches Kerr black holes. Observables like radiative flux, temperature, and spectral luminosity are suppressed by g. Optical simulations reveal g increases photon ring width and reduces intensity, potentially offering a way to distinguish SV from Kerr black holes in observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze how the regularization parameter g influences observables in rotating SV black hole systems and to explore their distinguishability from Kerr black holes through accretion disk properties and optical appearance.

Method: 采用了诺维尔-汤模型研究旋转SV黑洞的辐射通量、有效温度和光谱光度。使用反向光线追踪技术进行光学外观的数值模拟，量化不同g值下的参数变化，对比SgrA*和M87*的实例数据。

Result: 发现参数g抑制最大量值的辐射相关量，更大的g导致观测强度降低和光子环宽度增加。辐射效率与凯尔黑洞相同，但动力学量和ISCO位置依赖g。

Conclusion: 来自吸积盘的可观测特性可能为区分旋转SV黑洞和凯尔黑洞提供关键途径，并为未来的高分辨率观测提供理论支持。

Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the radiative properties and optical appearance of rotating SV black holes surrounded by a thin accretion disks, and mainly analyze the influence of the regularization parameter $g$ on related observables. The results show that although the kinetic quantities and the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) depend on the regularization parameter $g$, the radiative efficiency of the rotating SV black hole is the same as its Kerr counterpart. Within the Novikov-Thorne thin-disk model, the radiative flux, effective temperature, and spectral luminosity are studied, and by adopting observational parameters relevant to SgrA* and M87*, concrete examples of the rotating SV black holes are calculated and compared with that of the Kerr black holes. The results show that the parameter $g$ suppresses the maximum values of these quantities. In addition, using a backward ray-tracing technique, we numerically simulate the optical appearance of rotating SV black holes and analyze the corresponding intensity images, redshift and observed flux distributions. Our results show that these quantities are affected by $g$. In particular, as $g$ increases, the observed intensity is significantly suppressed and the photon ring region has remarkable increase in its width. Our findings suggest that accretion-disk-related observables may provide important avenues to distinguish rotating SV black holes and Kerr black holes, and offer theoretical guidance for future high-resolution observations.

TL;DR: The paper examines Perplexity.ai's comparison of various GRB models and phenomena, revealing concerning gaps in understanding, particularly regarding the Cannonball model and its relevance to different GRB types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend a previous analysis by evaluating how AI systems comprehend and present the relationships between different types of GRBs and their theoretical models, including the standard paradigm and the Cannonball model.

Method: The author queried Perplexity.ai using a specific URL to compare the standard paradigm and the Cannonball model with various GRB subtypes (long-duration, short-hard from neutron-star mergers, low-luminosity, X-ray flashes, X-ray transients) and non-solar cosmic rays. The AI's responses were recorded verbatim.

Result: The AI's responses highlighted gaps in its understanding of the Cannonball model's applicability to diverse GRB categories, often favoring the standard paradigm without critical evaluation. This suggests potential biases or knowledge limitations in current AI systems regarding niche astrophysical theories.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for caution in relying on AI-generated information for complex scientific topics. It calls for improved AI training on interdisciplinary astrophysical models and their evolving evidence bases.

Abstract: In a recent arXiv posting [1] I reported the result of an experiment: asking Perplexity.ai to compare three items concerning (ordinary) Gamma Ray Burts (GRBs): the data, the standard paradigm(s) and the "Cannonball" (CB) model. Here I ask the same URL to extend this comparison to long--lasting GRBs, binary Neutron-Star mergers and their associated short--hard GRBs, low--luminosity GRBs, X--ray flashes, X--ray transients, and non--solar cosmic rays. The results of this experiment are enlightening but worrisome. Except for this abstract, two footnotes and two other references to standard [2] and CB-model [3] articles and talks, all of what follows is, verbatim, what the cited AI "opines".

TL;DR: The paper reports the first detection of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) around PSR J0855-4644 using H.E.S.S. data, identifying it as a distinct TeV γ-ray source with a power-law spectrum and magnetic field strength consistent with other PWNe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pulsars are efficient particle accelerators, and the region containing Vela Junior SNR and PSR J0855-4644 is a prime location to study TeV γ-ray emission and PWN properties.

Method: Analysis of H.E.S.S. data via 3D modelling and forward folding, combined with XMM-Newton X-ray data for a joint leptonic fit.

Result: A new extended γ-ray component coincident with the pulsar was detected with a significance of 12.2σ, showing a power-law spectrum (ΓE = 1.81) and magnetic field ≥1.6μG.

Conclusion: The detected emission is confirmed as the PWN of PSR J0855-4644, expanding the known TeV PWN population and demonstrating the effectiveness of 3D analysis techniques.

Abstract: HESS J0852-463 is a TeV γ-ray source located in the Galactic plane. The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any γ-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV γ-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of ΓE = 1.81 \pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding γ-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and γ-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6μG and a spectral index of α = 1.88 \pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2σ. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar's characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper redefines 4U 1556-60 as an ultracompact neutron star X-ray binary at 700 pc, explaining its low luminosity and radio jet properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent Gaia data revealed the system's proximity, necessitating a re-evaluation of previous assumptions.

Method: Reinterpretation of existing data plus new X-ray and radio observations.

Result: Confirmed neutron star accretor via radio jet limits; X-ray luminosity and disk properties align with ultracompact systems. No orbital/spin periods detected.

Conclusion: The system's characteristics strongly支持 it being an ultracompact neutron star binary, with further orbital period studies required.

Abstract: 4U 1556-60 is a low-mass X-ray binary that was discovered more than 50 years ago as a persistent X-ray source; however, very little was known about it. Recently, Gaia obtained a parallax for the optical counterpart that places 4U 1556-60 at a distance of only about 700 pc, making it one of the closest X-ray binaries known to date. This close distance drastically alters what was previously assumed about the source. We revisit 4U 1556-60 in light of the newly determined distance of 700 pc, reinterpreting its literature and presenting new X-ray and radio observations to better understand various characteristics of the system. We conclude that a scenario in which 4U 1556-60 is a candidate ultracompact neutron star X-ray binary at a distance of ~700 pc is able to explain the observed properties of the source. It resides at a persistent X-ray luminosity of ~2x10^34 erg/s, an unusual value for a typical X-ray binary, but similar to several ultracompact systems. The ratio of the X-ray to optical luminosity is very high, also suggesting a physically small accretion disk. The radio jet is undetected with a very deep upper limit of 3x10^25 erg/s, which is about 10^3 times fainter than the expected black hole jet correlation, strongly indicating a neutron star accretor. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by a power law, and the X-ray timing properties are also consistent with observations of other very low accretion rate X-ray binaries. No spin or orbital periodicity are found in the X-ray data. Future observations, especially to determine its orbital period, will further aid in understanding 4U 1556-60.

TL;DR: The paper examines whether fluctuations in muon numbers in air showers from ultra-high-energy cosmic rays can constrain Lorentz invariance violations, achieving the strongest hadronic sector bounds yet without mass composition assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lorentz symmetry could be violated near the Planck scale in quantum gravity theories, and such violations might still be detectable at lower energy scales via cosmic rays despite being orders of magnitude below the Planck scale.

Method: Analyzing muon number fluctuations in extensive air showers observed at the Pierre Auger Observatory to detect potential Lorentz invariance violations, using this observable for the first time in such studies.

Result: Produced the strongest constraints on Lorentz invariance violations in the hadronic sector, independent of cosmic ray mass composition assumptions, opening a new parameter space region for testing these violations.

Conclusion: Muon fluctuations provide a novel and powerful method to probe Lorentz invariance, offering previously inaccessible insights into quantum gravity effects at ultra-high energies.

Abstract: Quantum gravity theories often modify spacetime symmetries. In particular, Lorentz invariance may be violated when approaching the Planck scale. Although the scales at which interactions occur in extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere are many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, these violations might still be observable. In this work, the fluctuations in the number of muons in the extensive air showers measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory are exploited, for the first time, to constrain Lorentz invariance violations. The bounds derived in the hadronic sector are the strongest ever obtained, and do not rely on assumptions about the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The fluctuations in the number of muons constitute a new and powerful observable to further explore Lorentz invariance in a region of the parameter space not accessible to other observables.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the accuracy of Fermi/LAT PSF models using pulsar data and demonstrates that revised PSF parameters reduce false positives in detecting extended emission around Mrk 501.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of Fermi/LAT PSF models in accurately distinguishing extended emission could lead to false positives. Testing PSF models against pulsars ensures reliable detection.

Method: Comparing IRF PSF models to bright pulsar data, refining parameters via analytical fitting, then reanalyzing Mrk 501 with improved PSF parameters.

Result: Original PSF models were inconsistent with pulsar data. Revised parameters eliminated previously reported extended emission in Mrk 501.

Conclusion: Fermi/LAT PSF improvements enhance detection accuracy, avoiding false claims of extension in astrophysical sources.

Abstract: Sensitivity of searches for extended emission around gamma-ray sources is naturally limited by the precision of the knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of gamma-ray telescopes. Inaccuracies in the PSF models of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) can potentially lead to false positive detections of source extension. We explore uncertainties in the Fermi/LAT PSF by comparing the PSF models provided by the Fermi/LAT Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) with signals of bright pulsars. We compare the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs with pulsar data and fit the pulsar data with the same analytical model as in the Fermi/LAT IRFs to derive an improved set of PSF parameters. We then apply this revised PSF parameterisation to the search of extended emission around a blazar, Mrk 501. We find that the parameters of the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs are inconsistent with the pulsar data. We obtain an improved set of PSF parameters from the fits to pulsar data that is consistent with observations. We find no evidence of the previously reported extended signal around Mrk 501 if the revised PSF consistent with pulsar data is used in data analysis.

### [46] [A universal critical accretion rate for black hole jet formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14838)
*Adelle J. Goodwin,Andrew Mummery*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exhibit the same accretion-outflow coupling as stellar-mass black holes, showing that outflows are launched at a critical accretion rate of ~0.02 L_Edd, mirroring observations of stellar-mass black holes. This scale-invariant behavior is observed in tidal disruption events (TDEs), resolving long-standing questions about outflow mechanisms in SMBH systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether black hole accretion-outflow coupling is scale-invariant between stellar and supermassive black holes, addressing the challenge that SMBH systems' slow evolution makes observing critical accretion transitions difficult. TDEs provide a rare opportunity to study rapid SMBH accretion phases.

Method: Analyzing tidal disruption events (TDEs) as natural laboratories to observe SMBH accretion dynamics. By monitoring TDEs over years, researchers identified two distinct outflow phases: one during super-Eddington accretion and another at a critical accretion rate (~0.02 L_Edd), matching the critical threshold seen in stellar-mass black holes.

Result: TDEs launch two distinct outflows: one during super-Eddington accretion and another at L_crit ≈ 0.02 L_Edd. This critical rate aligns with that observed in stellar-mass black holes, indicating universal accretion-outflow coupling across black hole masses.

Conclusion: SMBHs and stellar-mass black holes share the same accretion-outflow physics. The critical accretion rate for jet formation (~0.02 L_Edd) is scale-invariant, resolving discrepancies in TDE outflow observations and confirming统一的黑 hole accretion physics across scales.

Abstract: It has long been suspected that black hole accretion-outflow coupling is invariant from the stellar to supermassive scales. Stellar mass black hole accretion flows are known to launch jets and outflows as they transition through critical accretion rate thresholds, with values well constrained observationally owing to their short evolutionary timescales. In contrast, accretion flows in typical supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems (those in active galactic nuclei) evolve over thousands of years, making the critical transitions at which jets are launched impossible to constrain in individual systems. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide the unique opportunity to witness the birth and evolution of an accretion flow onto a SMBH which evolves on timescales of years. Here we show that TDEs launch outflows during a super-Eddington accretion phase and a second, physically distinct outflow, at a critical accretion rate of $L_{\rm crit} \approx0.02$ $L_{\rm Edd}$, the same as the critical accretion rate for state transitions observed in accreting stellar mass black holes. This work naturally explains the mechanism, observed properties, and detection rate for prompt and delayed outflows observed in TDEs, which until now have been open problems. More broadly, we demonstrate that SMBHs exhibit the same accretion-outflow coupling as stellar mass black holes and that the critical low accretion rate threshold for jet formation in black holes is scale invariant.

### [47] [Exploring the magnetic field of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar NGC 4631 X-8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14876)
*Amar Deo Chandra*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of NGC 4631 X-8, a 9.7 s ultraluminous X-ray pulsar with a rapid spin-up rate (∼9.6×10⁻⁸ s s⁻¹), reveals its magnetic field (∼0.3–2×10¹⁴ G) and evolutionary path toward becoming a millisecond pulsar (∼10⁹ G, ~1 Myr). This highlights ULXPs' role in millisecond pulsar formation and super-Eddington accretion's influence on magnetar progenitors linked to energetic events like GRBs and SLSNe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand ULXP evolutionary pathways, their potential connection to millisecond pulsar formation, and the role of transient super-Eddington accretion in powering extreme astrophysical events.

Method: Modeling surface magnetic field estimates (0.3–2×10¹⁴ G) via multiple models; simulating long-term spin-magnetic evolution under steady accretion; incorporating super-Eddington duty cycle estimates (14%) to assess mass accretion's impact.

Result: Predicted evolution to a millisecond pulsar with ∼10⁹ G magnetic field within ~1 million years; confirms ULXPs can recycle neutron stars into millisecond pulsars through accretion; links super-Eddington phases to magnetar properties influencing GRBs/SLSNe.

Conclusion: ULXPs like NGC 4631 X-8 provide critical evolutionary insights into millisecond pulsar formation paths and the connection between magnetar accretion phases and high-energy transients like GRBs and superluminous supernovae.

Abstract: NGC 4631 X-8 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having a spin period of about 9.7 s, discovered using XMM-Newton observations in 2025. The pulsar is known to show one of the largest spin-up rates ($\sim 9.6 \times 10^{-8}$ s s$^{-1}$) among the ULXP population. We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae.

### [48] [Modeling isolated magnetar spin-down evolution and implications for long-period radio transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15024)
*Jon Kwong,Kaya Mori*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the connection between long-period radio transients (LPTs) and older magnetars using propeller spin-down models. It shows that propeller phase transitions in high-field magnetars with dense environments can explain LPT's long periods and low period derivatives, predicting detectability limits and unusual radio emission mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the missing population of older magnetars and explain the unique properties of LPTs (long periods and high variability) through theoretical spin evolution models.

Method: Parametric analysis of isolated magnetar spin evolution using propeller spin-down models, supplemented by Monte-Carlo population synthesis simulations to test different ambient density (n₀) and initial magnetic field (B₀) scenarios.

Result: Propeller transition is necessary to reach LPT periods (>1000 s). Two models explain observed LPT periods (1-400 min) and period derivatives. Predictions include detectability limits for X-ray emission and non-traditional radio emission mechanisms during propeller phases.

Conclusion: LPTs are likely old accreting magnetars transitioning to propeller phases. Observational signatures like radio outbursts require mechanisms beyond standard pulsar/magnetar models, and their X-ray detectability diminishes over time.

Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of radio sources characterized by long spin periods ($P_{\text{spin}}>10^3$ s) and highly variable radio emission. While known magnetars are relatively young ($τ<10^5$ yrs) with spin periods clustered between $1-10$ sec, it has been proposed that LPTs may be linked to a missing population of older magnetars. In this paper, we present an extensive parametric analysis of isolated magnetar spin evolution using various propeller spin-down models. In general, at higher initial magnetar B-fields ($B_0>\sim10^{15}$ G) and larger ambient densities ($n_0>\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$), magnetars will transition to the propeller phase earlier, and they start accreting gas from the ISM or molecular clouds after $τ\sim10^8$ yrs. We found that a transition from the pulsar to the propeller phase is required to reach the observed LPT period range of $P>10^3$ s. More specifically, our population synthesis study based on Monte-Carlo simulations shows that two propeller models can account for most of the observed LPT periods ($P\sim1-400$ [min]) and their period derivative constraints ($\dot{P}<10^{-9}$ s s$^{-1}$). Our spin-down models predict that (1) nearby radio-quiet neutron stars with the estimated dipole $B$-field range of $B\sim(1-5)\times10^{13}$ G will transition to the propeller phase eventually after $τ>\sim10^7$ yrs; (2) thermal X-ray emission from accretion-phase magnetars becomes too faint for detection after traveling ($d>\sim10$ kpc) from their birth places; (3) sporadic radio outbursts observed from LPTs may not be explained by regular radio pulsar and magnetar emission mechanisms that operate during the propeller phase.

### [49] [Dyad: a binary-star dynamics and statistics library for Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13388)
*Amery Gration*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Dyad is a Python library for modeling binary star dynamics using statistical distributions of their parameters, supporting well-known stellar mass and orbital element models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study populations of binary stars by treating their parameters (masses and orbital elements) as random variables with probability distributions, enabling statistical analysis of binary star systems.

Method: Provides dyad.TwoBody class for individual systems and dyad.stats module with classes for probability distributions (e.g., Kroupa 2001, Salpeter 1955 for masses; Duquennoy & Mayor 1991, Moe & Di Stefano 2017 for orbital elements).

Result: Enables researchers to generate and analyze synthetic populations of binary stars using established astrophysical models, facilitating studies of binary star dynamics at scale.

Conclusion: Dyad offers a robust toolset for statistically modeling binary star populations, advancing computational astrophysics through organized implementation of key astrophysical distributions and system representations.

Abstract: Dyad is a Python library for studying the dynamics of binary stars considered as gravitational two-body systems. The dynamics of a binary star are determined by its primary and secondary stars' masses along with the secondary star's six orbital elements as defined in a frame comoving with the primary star. In a population of binary stars these eight parameters vary from member to member and can each be treated as a random variable having some probability distribution. Dyad provides a class, dyad.TwoBody, and a module, dyad.stats, for dealing with such a population of binary stars. The dyad.TwoBody class represents a gravitational two-body system while the dyad.stats module provides a suite of classes representing the probability distributions of (1) stellar masses (including those proposed by Kroupa, 2001, and Salpeter, 1955) as well as (2) mass ratios and orbital elements (including those proposed by Duquennoy & Mayor, 1991, and Moe & Di Stefano, 2017).

### [50] [Updated Sensitivities of the Five STIS L-mode Gratings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13441)
*Amy M. Jones,Svea Hernandez,Joleen K. Carlberg,Daniel Welty*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper details the re-derivation of spectral sensitivities for STIS low-resolution gratings after updates to standard star models, leading to updated calibration data with 1-1.5% accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Major updates to model atmospheres of primary standard stars caused discrepancies in predicted fluxes, necessitating recalibration of STIS sensitivities to maintain accuracy.

Method: Re-derived spectral sensitivities for five STIS L-mode gratings using updated model atmospheres, compared results from three standard stars, and delivered new throughput tables to CRDS.

Result: Updated calibration data triggered recalibration of all historical STIS datasets. Sensitivities agree within 1% across standards, with maximal 1.5% discrepancies in hydrogen-affected regions.

Conclusion: The recalibration ensures STIS data consistency post-atmosphere model updates, with minimal residuals highlighting robustness of the new calibrations despite hydrogen-related variations.

Abstract: Re-derivation of the sensitivities of all of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) observing modes were required after major updates were introduced to the model atmospheres of the three primary standard stars. The new predicted continuum fluxes were up to 2-3% different from the models used to originally calibrate STIS. This work focuses on the re-derivation of spectral sensitivities for the five STIS low-resolution (L-mode) gratings: G140L, G230L, G230LB, G430L, and G750L, which span wavelengths from the far-ultraviolet through the near infrared. Updated photometric throughput tables were delivered to the Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) on April 7, 2022 and April 14, 2023, which triggered a recalibration of all historical STIS datasets taken with these modes. The sensitivities derived from each of the standard stars typically agree with one another to better than 1%, though discrepancies as large as 1.5% are found in spectral regions most impacted by hydrogen absorption.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) improves the transfer of a spectral classifier from simulation data (DESI mocks) to real J-PAS observations, achieving higher F1 scores and true positive rates, particularly for high-redshift quasars, with minimal target labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain shift issues in astrophysical data caused by differences between simulations and real observations, which degrade model performance when trained on simulations alone.

Method: The method uses SSDA to transfer a pre-trained classifier from simulated DESI data to real J-PAS data. It leverages abundant simulation labels and a small labeled subset of target data for adaptation.

Result: SSDA outperforms both a J-PAS-only supervised model and a mocks-only model, achieving a macro-F1 of 0.82 and true positive rate of 0.89. Improvements are most notable in high-redshift quasar classification (F1=0.66 vs. baselines 0.55/0.37).

Conclusion: SSDA enables robust simulation-to-observation transfer with scarce target labels, enhancing data efficiency for Tasks like quasar identification and AGN detection in astrophysics.

Abstract: Modern studies in astrophysics and cosmology increasingly rely on simulations and cross-survey analyses, yet differences in data generation, instrumentation, calibration, and unmodeled physics introduce distribution mismatches between datasets (``domain shift''). In machine-learning pipelines, this occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and labels differs between the training (source) and application (target) domains, causing source-trained models to underperform on the target. Transfer learning and domain adaptation provide principled ways to mitigate this effect. We study a concrete simulation-to-observation case: semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to transfer a four-class spectral classifier -- high-redshift quasars, low-redshift quasars, galaxies, and stars -- from J-PAS mock catalogs based on DESI spectra to real J-PAS observations. Our pipeline pretrains on abundant labeled DESI$\rightarrow$J-PAS mocks and adapts to the target domain using a small labeled J-PAS subset. We benchmark SSDA against two baselines: a J-PAS--only supervised model trained with the same target-label budget, and a mocks-only model evaluated on held-out J-PAS data. On this held-out J-PAS data, SSDA achieves a macro-F1 score (balancing precision and recall) of $0.82$ and an overall true positive rate of $0.89$, compared to $0.79/0.85$ for the J-PAS--only baseline and $0.73/0.87$ for the mocks-only model. The gains are driven primarily by improved quasar classification, especially in the high-redshift subclass ($\mathrm{F1}=0.66$ vs.\ $0.55/0.37$), yielding better-calibrated candidate lists for spectroscopic targeting (e.g., WEAVE-QSO) and AGN searches. This study shows how modest target supervision enables robust, data-efficient simulation-to-observation transfer when simulations are plentiful but target labels are scarce.

TL;DR: This paper presents the absolute flux and wavelength calibration for the JWST NIRCam WFSS mode, detailing geometrical trace models, wavelength precision, and flux accuracy, ensuring consistency across modules and supporting future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a robust calibration framework for the NIRCam WFSS mode enabling accurate slitless spectroscopy, ensuring consistency between modules and grism orientations.

Method: Used commissioning data from multiple programs to model spectral trace geometry with 2D polynomials, performed wavelength calibration using planetary nebula observations, and flux calibration with a G-type star standard.

Result: Achieved RMS accuracy of 0.1 pixels in trace geometry, wavelength precision of 1.6-1.9A for +1 orders and 0.5A for +2 orders, and 3% flux accuracy, validating the calibration framework.

Conclusion: The calibration ensures accurate NIRCam WFSS observations, supports JWST pipeline improvements, and provides reliable references for future spectroscopic analyses.

Abstract: We present the absolute flux and wavelength calibration of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) mode. Each of NIRCam's two modules (A and B) provides independent long wavelength (LW) grism spectroscopy over the 2.4-5.0 micron range, with orthogonally oriented R and C grisms. Using commissioning and calibration data from programs 01076, 01536, 01537, 01538, 01479, 01480, 04449, 04498, 06606, and 06628, we have measured the field-dependent geometry and wavelength dispersion of both first and second order spectra across the full detector area. The trace geometry was modeled using two-dimensional third-order polynomials that reproduce the observed spectral positions with an RMS accuracy better than 0.1 pixel. Wavelength calibration, derived from observations of the planetary nebula SMP LMC 58, achieves a precision of 1.6-1.9A for the +1 orders and 0.5A for the +2 orders. Absolute flux calibration, established from observations of the G-type star standard P330E, provides a consistent sensitivity function across all grisms and modules with an absolute flux accuracy of 3\%. The resulting calibration framework defines the geometric, wavelength, and photometric reference for all NIRCam WFSS observations and ensures cross-consistency between modules and grism orientations. These calibrations form the basis for accurate slitless spectroscopy with NIRCam and will support ongoing improvements to the JWST calibration pipeline and data products.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study identifies a new nonlinearity in H4RG-10 detectors under moderately elevated temperatures caused by defect currents and proposes a data-driven correction method to restore linearity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the newly identified nonlinearity not accounted for by existing models, ensuring accurate signal linearity in H4RG-10 detectors operating at higher temperatures, particularly crucial for pixels with high defect currents.

Method: A dual-illumination measurement combined with dark exposure is used with a data-driven nonlinearity correction (NLC) method, modeling both classical response and defect currents, with optimal model selection per pixel.

Result: The method significantly improves linearity in pixels with high defect currents while maintaining performance in others, achieving reliable correction across the entire detector array.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective restoration of linearity through data-driven post-processing, offering a calibration framework for future warm-operation scenarios despite the nonlinearity being minimal under standard temperatures.

Abstract: We report a newly identified nonlinearity in H4RG-10 near-infrared detectors operating under moderately elevated-temperature conditions (114 K). This component, that potentially arises from illumination-independent defect currents, introduces additional nonlinearity not captured by conventional correction models. To address this issue, we propose a data-driven nonlinearity correction (NLC) method that models the nonlinear behavior of both the classical response and the defect currents, using dual-illumination measurements and a dark exposure. Applied to H4RG-10 detectors on the PRIME telescope, the method significantly improves signal linearity, especially for pixels with high defect current, while maintaining comparable performance elsewhere. By selecting the optimal correction model per pixel, reliable NLC is achieved across the full array. This study characterizes a nonlinearity intrinsic to H4RG-10 detectors and demonstrates that data-driven post-processing can effectively restore linearity in the presence of large defect currents. Although these effects are unlikely to be significant under nominal operating temperatures, the approach may provide a practical calibration framework for future warm-operation scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the algebraic definition of polarization modulation efficiency to handle varying throughput and photon noise across different modulation states, enabling optimization of spatially modulated polarimetry and calibration schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing efficiency models when applied to spatial polarization modulation with unequal optical paths and to develop a merit function for optimizing calibration sequences tailored to specific instruments.

Method: Extends the traditional efficiency formula by incorporating variable throughput and noise statistics per modulation state, then applies this framework to design a merit function for calibration optimization.

Result: A generalized efficiency metric and a practical merit function that account for instrumental variability, enhancing polarimetric performance and calibration effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide necessary tools for optimizing spatially modulated polarization instruments and their calibration processes, improving accuracy and efficiency in solar/stellar spectro-polarimetry.

Abstract: We review the algebraic definition of the efficiency of a polarization modulation scheme, which is commonly adopted for solar and stellar spectro-polarimetry applications, and generalize it to allow distinct states of the modulation cycle to have arbitrary throughput and different photon-noise statistics for each state. Such a generalization becomes necessary to model and optimize the polarimetric efficiency of instruments implementing spatial polarization modulation schemes, where different optical paths are assigned to different polarization analysis states, which may be characterized by different throughput values. The proposed algebraic extension also proves essential for introducing a workable concept of the efficiency of a polarization calibration scheme, which can then be used to create a merit function for the optimization of calibration sequences, which take into account the specific characteristics of the polarimetric instrument and of its calibration optics.

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of a developed formalism to address polarization cross-talk in spatial modulators, examines polarimetric noise at high modulation frequencies, and analyzes spectrograph instabilities caused by mechanical and thermal factors. It also provides methods to estimate errors in the Stokes response matrix for improving polarimetric instrumentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build upon previous research on atmospheric seeing's impact on polarization cross-talk, address challenges in spatial modulators, understand high-frequency modulation noise, and mitigate errors from spectrograph instabilities affecting polarimetric measurements.

Method: Extending a prior formalism to spatial modulators, analyzing the elimination of cross-talk, investigating polarimetric noise in high-frequency limits, modeling spectrograph instabilities from vibrations, thermal drifts, and pointing jitter, and applying the formalism to error estimation in Stokes matrices.

Result: Demonstrates full elimination of cross-talk in spatial modulators, clarifies polarimetric noise behavior at high frequencies, identifies spectral gradient contributions to polarimetric errors, and establishes a framework for quantifying errors in Stokes matrices.

Conclusion: The formalism enables precise error budgeting for polarimetric instruments by addressing key challenges like cross-talk, noise, and spectrograph instability, thereby enhancing the reliability of such instruments under varied operational conditions.

Abstract: We expand on our previous study of the impact of atmospheric seeing on polarization cross-talk, and show how the formalism that was developed in that work can be applied to treat the case of spatial modulators of polarization. Beside formally demonstrating how the problem of cross-talk is fully eliminated in such devices, we also gain insight on the meaning of polarimetric noise of temporal modulation schemes in the limit of very high modulation frequency. We also describe the problem of spectrograph instabilities, and how the spectral gradients that are naturally associated with a line spectrum feed into the problem of polarimetric errors induced by mechanical vibrations, thermal drifts, and pointing jitter. Finally, we show how this formalism can be used to estimate the contribution of polarization cross-talk to the errors on the elements of the 4$\times$4 Stokes response matrix, for the purpose of producing realistic error budgets for polarimetric instrumentation.

<details>

Motivation: Verify the feasibility of using CubeSat-class X-ray observatories for pulsar navigation and evaluate the SEPO method's performance under varying orbital-pulsar geometry.

Method: Used NinjaSat's GMC detectors to observe the Crab Pulsar at different epochs (total 100 ks exposure). Applied the SEPO method to optimize orbital parameters based on pulsar pulse profile significance, then compared results with GPS-derived positions.

Result: Position accuracy along Crab's line of sight was ~40 km, with 3D errors ranging 27-370 km depending on observation time. Confirmed SEPO's accuracy dependence on satellite-pulsar orbital geometry.

Conclusion: CubeSats can enable pulsar navigation with practical accuracy. SEPO method's effectiveness is geometry-dependent, requiring seasonal考虑 in mission planning. First experimental validation of these concepts.

Abstract: This study demonstrated the pulsar navigation capability of the CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat, which is equipped with two Gas Multiplier Counters (GMCs). The GMCs are sensitive to the 2-50 keV energy band and have an effective area of 16 cm^2 per module at 6 keV. We verified the timing accuracy by observing the Crab Pulsar and confirmed stable timing performance within 100 microseconds. To demonstrate pulsar navigation, we applied a method that optimizes orbital parameters to maximize the significance of the pulsar X-ray pulse profile, known as the Significance Enhancement of Pulse-profile with Orbit-dynamics (SEPO) method. We observed the Crab Pulsar with a total exposure of approximately 100 ks at different epochs and analyzed the data transmitted to the ground. By comparing the optimized orbit with the satellite position derived from Global Positioning System data, we quantitatively evaluated the navigation performance. The results show that the position component along the Crab line of sight was consistently constrained within approximately 40 km, and the three-dimensional position error ranged from 27 to 370 km depending on the observation epoch. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying a CubeSat-class X-ray observatory to pulsar navigation and provide the first experimental verification that the accuracy of the SEPO method depends on the seasonal geometry between the orbital plane and the pulsar direction.

TL;DR: The paper constructs a concept-object knowledge graph from astrophysics papers and uses it to predict future concept-object associations, showing that historical data outperforms other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if historical patterns in a knowledge graph can predict future associations between astrophysical objects and scientific concepts, aiding in optimizing telescope time for follow-up observations.

Method: Built a knowledge graph using an automated pipeline extracting objects from papers, linking them to concepts via clustering. Tested prediction methods: matrix factorization (ALS) with smoothing vs. KNN and recency heuristics.

Result: ALS with smoothing achieved 16.8% higher NDCG@100 and 19.8% higher Recall@100 than KNN, significantly outperforming heuristics. Demonstrates predictive power of historical literature.

Conclusion: Historical literature contains predictive structures useful for forecasting associations, enabling tools to prioritize astronomical observations efficiently.

Abstract: We construct a concept-object knowledge graph from the full astro-ph corpus through July 2025. Using an automated pipeline, we extract named astrophysical objects from OCR-processed papers, resolve them to SIMBAD identifiers, and link them to scientific concepts annotated in the source corpus. We then test whether historical graph structure can forecast new concept-object associations before they appear in print. Because the concepts are derived from clustering and therefore overlap semantically, we apply an inference-time concept-similarity smoothing step uniformly to all methods. Across four temporal cutoffs on a physically meaningful subset of concepts, an implicit-feedback matrix factorization model (alternating least squares, ALS) with smoothing outperforms the strongest neighborhood baseline (KNN using text-embedding concept similarity) by 16.8% on NDCG@100 (0.144 vs 0.123) and 19.8% on Recall@100 (0.175 vs 0.146), and exceeds the best recency heuristic by 96% and 88%, respectively. These results indicate that historical literature encodes predictive structure not captured by global heuristics or local neighborhood voting, suggesting a path toward tools that could help triage follow-up targets for scarce telescope time.

Conclusion: The revised calibrations improve STIS data accuracy, ensuring reliable photometric measurements. The authors emphasize ongoing validation and future adjustments needed to maintain calibration consistency across instruments and models.

Abstract: The sensitivities of STIS first-order, medium resolution modes were redetermined from on-orbit observations and CALSPEC models (version 11) of the primary white-dwarf spectrophotometric standard stars G191-B2B, GD 71, and GD 153. The sensitivity of an additional configuration was updated by comparing observations of the secondary standard BD +75 325 with the STIS low-resolution spectrum that has been calibrated consistently with the version 11 models. The procedures used to derive the sensitivities and verify the PHOTTAB reference files prior to their activation in CRDS (on May 1, 2025) are described. Results are presented in graphical form in an extensive appendix. Issues and uncertainties are discussed briefly, along with recommendations for future work.

### [60] [Probing Rotational Dynamics of Quark Gluon Plasma via Global Vorticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13618)
*Bhagyarathi Sahoo,Captain R. Singh,Raghunath Sahoo*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the vorticity field in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using hadron spectra, finding consistency with Λ polarization data and observing particle-dependent vorticity variations with centrality and energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of vorticity on QCD matter's evolution and freeze-out by analyzing spin polarization and alignment data from RHIC/LHC experiments.

Method: A data-driven approach to extract vorticity from transverse momentum spectra of multiple hadron species across various collision conditions (energy, centrality).

Result: Vorticity magnitude matches thermal model predictions; particle species, centrality, and energy significantly affect vorticity, indicating sensitivity to hadron structure and freeze-out dynamics.

Conclusion: Vorticity-driven spin effects constrain QCD matter's rotational properties, highlighting the need to consider hadron-level dynamics in medium studies.

Abstract: The findings on the spin polarization of $Λ$, $Ξ$, and $Ω$ hyperons and spin alignment of $K^{*0}$, $φ$, and $D^{*+}$ mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at the RHIC and LHC facilities propose the emergence of a strong vorticity field produced in these collisions. Contemplating the potential impact of vorticity on the space-time evolution of deconfined QCD matter and its freeze-out properties, we aim to investigate its characteristics within the medium. We introduce a complementary and data-driven approach to quantify the global vorticity field by extracting it directly from the transverse momentum spectra of produced hadrons. Employing the experimental data for $Λ$, $Ξ$, $Ω$, $K^{*0}$, $K^{*\pm}$, $φ$, $ρ$, and $D^{*+}$ at mid-rapidity in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions over a wide range of beam energies, $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7.7$ GeV-5.02 TeV, and centrality classes, we systematically examine spin-vorticity coupling in the medium. Our finding on the magnitude of the extracted vorticity is consistent with values deduced from $Λ$ and $\barΛ$ polarization measurements using statistical thermal models under the non-relativistic limit. Notably, we observe a prominent particle-species dependence of the vorticity, as well as a non-trivial variation with collision centrality and beam energy. These results indicate that vorticity-driven spin phenomena are sensitive to hadron structure and freeze-out dynamics, providing new constraints on the rotational properties of the QCD matter.

### [61] [Next-to-Leading-Order QCD Predictions for the $Σ$ Dirac Form Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13716)
*Bo-Xuan Shi,Hui-Xin Yu,Xue-Chen Zhao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper calculates next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to the electromagnetic form factors of Σ hyperons using hard-collinear factorization, finding significant radiative corrections and providing updated predictions by combining perturbative results with lattice QCD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision of theoretical predictions for Σ hyperon electromagnetic form factors by incorporating next-to-leading-order QCD corrections and using nonperturbative distribution amplitudes from lattice QCD.

Method: Compute seven-point partonic correlation functions within the hard-collinear factorization framework to extract short-distance coefficient functions. Evaluate one-loop radiative corrections and combine these with lattice QCD-derived distribution amplitudes.

Result: Numerically significant radiative corrections in the broad momentum transfer range are observed. State-of-the-art predictions for Σ hyperon form factors are achieved by merging perturbative calculations with nonperturbative data.

Conclusion: The inclusion of next-to-leading-order corrections and lattice QCD distribution amplitudes is essential for accurate predictions of Σ hyperon electromagnetic properties, enhancing precision in hadronic physics studies.

Abstract: In this work, we compute the next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to the Dirac electromagnetic form factors of the $Σ$ hyperons within the hard-collinear factorization framework at leading power. The corresponding short-distance coefficient functions are extracted from the relevant seven-point partonic correlation functions. We find that the one-loop radiative corrections to the leading-twist hard-scattering contributions are numerically significant over a broad range of momentum transfer. Combining the perturbatively calculated hard kernels with nonperturbative $Σ$ distribution amplitudes determined from lattice QCD, we present state-of-the-art theoretical predictions for the $Σ$ hyperon electromagnetic form factors.

### [62] [The 95 GeV and 125 GeV Higgs Excesses in the Left-Right Supersymmetric Standard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13976)
*Zhi-Chuan Wang,Jin-Lei Yang,Qi-Zhen Qin,Wen-Hui Zhang,Tai-Fu Feng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines the excesses around 95 GeV in diphoton and b\bar{b} experiments using the Left-Right Supersymmetric Model (LRSSM), incorporating loop corrections to Higgs masses. It explains the observed signal strengths and analyzes the impact of LRSSM parameters on both 95 GeV and 125 GeV Higgs predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin of the observed excesses around 95 GeV in experimental data and provide a theoretical framework within LRSSM that accounts for the signal strengths of Higgs bosons, especially addressing the need for loop corrections in Higgs mass calculations.

Method: The LRSSM is used with one-loop and two-loop effective potential corrections. The model's parameters (tanβ_R, v_R, v_S) are varied to study their effects on signal strengths (μ_{γγ}, μ_{b\bar{b}}) for both the 95 GeV and 125 GeV neutral Higgs bosons.

Result: The LRSSM successfully describes the experimental signal strengths for the 95 GeV Higgs. The model's parameters significantly influence both Higgs boson signal strengths, offering insights into the relationship between LRSSM parameters and observable phenomena.

Conclusion: The LRSSM provides a viable explanation for the 95 GeV excess through its parameterization and loop-corrected Higgs mass framework. This work highlights the importance of LRSSM-specific parameters in predicting Higgs properties and encourages further experimental testing of the model.

Abstract: This study investigates the excesses observed around 95 GeV in diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ experiments within the framework of the Left-Right Supersymmetric Model (LRSSM). Considering the one-loop and two-loop effective potential corrections to the Higgs masses, the model is able to describe the experimentally observed $μ(h_{95})_{γγ}$ and $μ(h_{95})_{b\bar{b}}$ signal strengths. In addition, we also present the impacts of the LRSSM-specific parameters $\tanβ_{R}$, $v_{R}$ and $v_{S}$ on the theoretical predictions of the signal strengths for the 95 GeV and 125 GeV neutral Higgs both.

### [63] [Current status and prospects of light bino-higgsino dark matter in natural SUSY](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14088)
*XinTian Wang,Murat Abdughani*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a light bino-higgsino dark matter scenario within a natural supersymmetric framework, considering constraints from LUX-ZEPLIN results and other experiments. It finds that the relic density is insufficient to account for observed dark matter, and much of the viable parameter space will be testable at the HL-LHC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the viability of the light bino-higgsino dark matter model under recent experimental constraints and explore future experimental implications.

Method: Systematically analyzed parameter ranges for bino and higgsino masses using fine-tuning criteria (Δ_EW < 30), incorporating constraints from Higgs physics, rare B decays, LEP, DD experiments (including LZ), and relic density calculations.

Result: Parameter space parts remain viable but relic density is only ~2% of Planck's observation. Current LHC data excludes some regions, while HL-LHC at 14 TeV with 3000 fb⁻¹ will probe the rest.

Conclusion: The scenario's viability depends on HL-LHC results; insufficient relic density implies other components may contribute to dark matter.

Abstract: Given recent advancements in dark matter (DM) search experiments, particularly the latest LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) direct detection (DD) results, we systematically investigate the light bino-higgsino DM scenario within the natural supersymmetric framework. Requiring the electroweak fine-tuning parameter $Δ_{\text{EW}} < 30$ fixes the higgsino mass parameter in the range $|μ| \in [100, 350]$ GeV, while we extend the bino mass to $M_1 \in [10, 350]$ GeV. Incorporating constraints from Higgs physics, rare $B$ decays, LEP limits, and DD experiments, we find that part of the parameter space remains viable. However, the relic density of neutralino DM necessarily lies below the observed Planck value, contributing at most $\sim 2\%$ of the total DM abundance. Some of the surviving parameter space is already excluded by current 13 TeV LHC searches, while the future 14 TeV HL-LHC with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity will probe the remaining region.

### [64] [Scale invariant radiative neutrino mass model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14115)
*Daijiro Suematsu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scale-invariant radiative neutrino mass model with custodial symmetry, where the weak scale is suppressed due to the symmetry, and explores dark matter and baryon asymmetry generation. Dark matter is identified as a light right-handed neutrino (sub-MeV mass), and leptogenesis occurs via resonant mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the hierarchy problem and naturalness issues, the model employs scale invariance. Custodial symmetry suppresses the weak scale, avoiding large quantum corrections. Additionally, it seeks to explain neutrino masses, dark matter, and baryon asymmetry within a unified framework.

Method: Uses Coleman-Weinberg mechanism to generate a singlet scalar VEV, breaking both custodial symmetry and scale invariance. Inert Higgs doublet and right-handed neutrinos acquire masses via this VEV. Calculates constraints for dark matter relic abundance and resonant leptogenesis conditions.

Result: Inert doublet's neutral component cannot account for dark matter abundance, leading to identification of the lightest RH neutrino as dark matter (∼<1 MeV). Resonant leptogenesis successfully explains baryon asymmetry. Predicts observable signatures in low-mass neutrino detectors and cosmological observations.

Conclusion: The model consistently explains neutrino masses, provides a viable sub-MeV dark matter candidate, and accounts for baryon asymmetry via resonant leptogenesis. Future experiments on ultralight DM and neutrino physics can test these predictions.

Abstract: We propose a scale invariant radiative neutrino mass model with custodial symmetry. Masses of an inert doublet scalar and right-handed neutrinos are induced by a vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a singlet scalar caused through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. It violates spontaneously both the custodial symmetry and the scale invariance. The weak scale can take a suppressed value compared with the singlet scalar VEV because of the custodial symmetry. In this framework we study phenomenological consequences for neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon number asymmetry. Since the required dark matter abundance cannot be explained by a neutral component of the inert doublet scalar, the lightest right-handed neutrino should be dark matter. Mass of the dark matter is predicted to be less than $O(1)$ MeV and baryon number asymmetry could be explained through resonant leptogenesis.

### [65] [An imprint of intrinsic quark--gluon correlations: a nonmonotonic feature in $e(x)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14164)
*Chao Shi,Liming Lu,Ian Cloët,Wenbao Jia,Peter Tandy*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using rainbow-ladder Dyson-Schwinger equations to study the pion's chiral-odd, twist-3 parton distribution e_q(x). By deriving a new equation for the pion's quark-quark correlation matrix, it simultaneously extracts the twist-2 and twist-3 distributions. Chiral symmetry suppresses the twist-2 component, leaving a dominant twist-3 component with a node, indicating significant intrinsic quark-gluon correlations. This finding is compatible with but not confirmed by recent proton data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of chiral symmetry and intrinsic quark-gluon correlations in the pion's parton distributions, specifically focusing on the twist-3 distribution e_q(x), which has been less explored than twist-2 distributions.

Method: The study employs rainbow-ladder Dyson-Schwinger equations to derive a new correlation matrix for the pion. This matrix allows simultaneous extraction of twist-2 (f_q(x)) and twist-3 (e_q(x)) distributions. The method accounts for both quark-gluon correlations and chiral symmetry effects.

Result: Chiral symmetry significantly suppresses the twist-2 component of e_q(x), leaving the genuine twist-3 quark-gluon term dominant with a node. This suggests the twist-3 term contributes substantially to hadronic e(x), producing a nonmonotonic structure. A hump-like feature in the data aligns with some proton studies but needs more precise verification.

Conclusion: The genuine twist-3 quark-gluon correlations are crucial for understanding the pion's parton structure. The observed nonmonotonicity and node in e_q(x) serve as clear imprints of these correlations. Further experimental precision is required to confirm these results and their implications for hadronic physics.

Abstract: We present the first rainbow-ladder Dyson-Schwinger equations study of the pion's chiral-odd, twist-3 parton distribution $e_{\rm q}(x)$. By deriving a novel Dyson-Schwinger equation for the pion's quark-quark correlation matrix, we simultaneously extract from it both the unpolarized twist-2 parton distribution function $f_{\rm q}(x)$ and the twist-3 distribution $e_{\rm q}(x)$. Our results show that chiral symmetry strongly suppresses the twist-2 component of $e_{\rm q}(x)$, leaving the genuine twist-3 quark-gluon component dominant and featuring a node. We therefore argue that the genuine twist-3 term can make a substantial contribution to hadronic $e(x)$, producing a nonmonotonic structure that is a clear imprint of intrinsic quark-gluon correlations. We point out that the existence of a hump-like feature is compatible with, although not uniquely indicated by, recent proton extractions and awaits more precise determination.

### [66] [Factorization formula connecting the $Λ_Q$ LCDA in QCD and boosted HQET](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14187)
*Yu-Ji Shi,Jun Zeng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a factorization formula linking QCD and HQET light-cone distribution amplitudes for heavy baryons, simplifying the matching procedure using the method-of-regions, and calculates one-loop corrections to enable future lattice QCD studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance precision phenomenology in heavy baryon decays by developing a framework for calculating light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) that are essential for accurate theoretical predictions.

Method: Derivation of a factorization formula connecting leading-twist QCD LCDAs with boosted HQET LCDAs for $\Lambda_Q$ baryons, use of method-of-regions to simplify perturbative matching calculations, and computation of one-loop perturbative corrections in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme.

Result: Obtained a one-loop jet function as the matching kernel, which is crucial for future lattice QCD calculations of heavy baryon LCDAs.

Conclusion: The derived factorization formula and simplification techniques provide a critical step towards lattice QCD computations, enhancing precision in heavy baryon decay studies.

Abstract: Light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are essential to precision phenomenology in heavy baryon decays. In this work, we derive a factorization formula connecting the leading-twist QCD LCDA to the boosted HQET LCDA of the $Λ_Q$ baryon in the peak region. We demonstrate a significant simplification of the matching procedure by applying the method-of-regions to perturbative calculations. With this simplification, we calculate the required one-loop perturbative corrections to the QCD and boosted HQET LCDAs in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, and thereby obtain the one-loop jet function that serves as the matching kernel in the factorization formula. This result provides a critical step toward lattice QCD calculation of heavy baryon LCDAs in the future.

### [67] [Limits on the Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics from geomagnetic data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14217)
*G. F. de Carvalho,M. Fillion,P. C. Malta,C. A. D. Zarro*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates Lorentz-symmetry violation using a CPT-odd term and derives tighter constraints on k_AF components using geomagnetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore Lorentz-symmetry violation and improve upon existing constraints by analyzing the effects of the CPT-odd Carroll-Field-Jackiw term on near-Earth magnetic fields.

Method: Solved Maxwell's equations with the added Carroll-Field-Jackiw term using Green's function method for a static point-like magnetic dipole, comparing predictions with geomagnetic measurements.

Result: Obtained constraints on k_AF components in the Sun-centered frame: |(k_AF)_Z| ≤ 4×10^-25 GeV and |(k_AF)_X,Y| ≤ 10^-24 GeV (2σ), improving previous bounds by four orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Geomagnetic data provides a sensitive probe for testing Lorentz invariance, achieving unprecedented constraints on the k_AF parameters.

Abstract: Lorentz-symmetry violation may be described via the CPT-odd, dimension-3, Carroll-Field-Jackiw term, which couples the electromagnetic fields to a constant 4-vector $k_{\rm AF}$ selecting a preferred direction in spacetime. We solve the field equations using the Green's method for a static point-like magnetic dipole and find the $k_{\rm AF}$-dependent corrections to the standard dipolar magnetic field that strongly dominates the near-Earth magnetic field. Given the very good agreement between current models and ground- and satellite-based geomagnetic data, our strongest constraints on the components of $k_{\rm AF}$ in the Sun-centered frame read $|(k_{\rm AF})_Z| \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-25} \, {\rm GeV}$ for $|(k_{\rm AF})_X|, |(k_{\rm AF})_Y| \lesssim 10^{-24} \, {\rm GeV}$ at the two-sigma level. This represents an improvement of about four orders of magnitude over earlier bounds based on other geophysical phenomena.

### [68] [Measuring neutrino mixing above 1 TeV with astrophysical neutrinos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14308)
*Mauricio Bustamante,Qinrui Liu,Gabriela Barenboim*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility of measuring neutrino mixing parameters (θ₂₃ and θ₁₃) at TeV-PeV energies using astrophysical neutrino flavor composition, emphasizing future potential of multi-telescope observations combined with traditional experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flavor measurements from IceCube data are insufficient due to statistical limitations and uncertainties, prompting a need to assess future observational capabilities for testing neutrino oscillation models.

Method: Analyzes potential sensitivity of upcoming multi-neutrino-telescope observations (including existing telescopes) to θ₂₃ and θ₁₃, quantifies the minimum detectable beyond-Standard-Model effects, and establishes a roadmap for future experiments.

Result: Future combined observations could constrain θ₂₃ and θ₁₃ in the TeV-PeV regime, enabling tests of three-flavor mixing framework and sensitivity to new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Conclusion: Multi-telescope collaborations and future data will provide unprecedented sensitivity to neutrino mixing parameters, offering a pathway to explore new physics at high energies previously inaccessible.

Abstract: We assess the potential for measuring neutrino mixing parameters at energies above 1~TeV, for the first time, using the flavor composition of TeV--PeV astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the proportion of $ν_e$, $ν_μ$, and $ν_τ$. Today, flavor measurements inferred from the 11.4-year IceCube Medium Energy Starting Events sample are insufficient to constrain the mixing parameters due to limited statistics, challenges in flavor identification, and uncertainty in neutrino production. Yet, upcoming multi-neutrino-telescope observations -- even using only existing telescopes -- may achieve sensitivity to $θ_{23}$ and $θ_{13}$ when combined with traditional oscillation experiments. We establish the current status and future prospects for testing the three-flavor mixing framework in the previously unexplored TeV--PeV regime and quantify the minimum detectable size of flavor-modifying beyond-Standard-Model effects, providing a roadmap for high-energy neutrino mixing measurements.

*Zirong Chen,Dan Chi,Jinmian Li,Junle Pei*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores detecting sub-GeV dark mesons produced in the atmosphere via a dark sector coupled to the Standard Model through a U(1)_D vector portal. Using simulations with JUNO, it shows sensitivity to coupling strengths as low as 2.4e-4 for light mediators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe unexplored parameter space in dark matter models, especially for light mediators (Z' masses <10 MeV) not reachable by current experiments.

Method: Simulated cosmic-ray production of dark mesons via proton bremsstrahlung, meson decays, Drell-Yan, and their hadronization using a modified Quark Combination Model. Flux calculations and JUNO detector responses were done with GENIE, analyzing both elastic and inelastic scattering channels.

Result: JUNO can achieve sensitivity limits on dark gauge boson couplings down to 2.4×10^-4 for m_Z' <10 MeV, opening new Parameter space for light mediators.

Conclusion: JUNO is a powerful tool for dark sector studies, particularly effective for low-mass mediators. The findings highlight the importance of atmospheric production channels in dark matter detection experiments.

Abstract: We investigate the atmospheric production and subsequent detection of sub-GeV dark mesons within the framework of a confining dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) via a $U(1)_{\text{D}}$ vector portal. High-energy cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere produce dark quarks through proton bremsstrahlung, rare decay of Standard Model mesons, and Drell-Yan processes, which subsequently hadronize into dark mesons. We adopt a modified Quark Combination Model to describe the non-perturbative dark hadronization process, allowing for a detailed event-level characterization of the dark meson flux. We simulate the flux and the interaction of these relativistic dark mesons in the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) using the GENIE generator, considering both elastic scattering off nuclei and deep inelastic scattering channels. Based on the projected 20 kton$\cdot$year exposure, we derive sensitivity limits on the coupling strength between the dark gauge boson and the SM sector. Our results demonstrate that JUNO can probe substantial unexplored parameter space, particularly for light mediators ($m_{Z^\prime} \lesssim 10$ MeV), where it achieves sensitivities to the portal interaction as low as $2.4 \times 10^{-4}$.

*Luiz L. Lopes,Cesar V. Flores,Débora P. Menezes*

Main category: hep-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the role of the symmetry energy slope in the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star matter, particularly how it affects structural and dynamical properties under varying magnetic field conditions.

Method: The authors use a chaotic magnetic field approximation and perform calculations for neutron star observables, including mass, radius, redshift, tidal deformability, and gravitational-wave frequencies, by varying the symmetry slope parameter in the EOS.

Result: The results show that the symmetry slope significantly impacts the neutron star observables, with variations in magnetic field strengths altering these effects. Key parameters like tidal deformability and gravitational-wave frequencies are particularly sensitive to changes in the symmetry slope.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity of accurately constraining the symmetry energy slope to better predict neutron star properties and interpret observational data, especially in magnetized environments.

Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of the symmetry slope on the observables of weakly and strongly magnetized neutron stars within the chaotic magnetic field approximation. We investigate the impact of the symmetry energy slope in the equation of state, as well as on the observables of neutron stars, by calculating their masses, radii, redshifts, tidal deformabilities, and fundamental-mode gravitational-wave frequencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a compact, coordinate-independent method for deriving field equations in Lorentz-violating electrodynamics and simplify the study of their effects on photon behavior.

Method: Uses differential forms and the Newman-Penrose null-tetrad formalism to derive first-order equations, constructing gauge-invariant Maxwell actions up to mass dimension six without explicit index manipulations.

Result: Successfully derives a systematic framework for analyzing Lorentz-violating effects, offering an efficient tool for studying asymptotic photon properties.

Conclusion: The combined approach streamlines the analysis of Lorentz symmetry violations in Maxwell theories and aids in understanding their impact on electromagnetic phenomena.

Abstract: We develop a differential-form approach to systematically derive the Newman-Penrose null-tetrad equations for Lorentz-violating extensions of Maxwell electrodynamics. The coordinate-independent nature of differential forms allows the actions and corresponding field equations of the theory to be expressed compactly and enables a systematic and transparent derivation of first-order equations in the Newman-Penrose formalism. Within this formalism, we explicitly present a simple algebraic construction for the gauge invariant extended Maxwell actions that avoids explicit index manipulations up to mass dimension six. The combined scheme of differential-form approach and Newman-Penrose formalism offers an efficient tool for analyzing Lorentz-violating effects on asymptotic photon propagation and polarization.

### [72] [Establishing the Primary HEFT as a Precision Benchmark for UV-HEFT Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14418)
*Zizhou Ge,Huayang Song,Xia Wan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Real Higgs Triplet Model (RHTM) by matching it to the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) using different parameter choices and power-counting schemes. It introduces Primary HEFT (pHEFT) as a benchmark framework that preserves UV information and provides higher accuracy through linear relations between parameters and heavy masses. The authors also derive HEFT operators for fermions in RHTM for the first time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically connect the RHTM with HEFT under varied conditions, clarify relationships between different HEFT formulations, and establish a benchmark framework (pHEFT) that retains maximal UV information without unnecessary truncations.

Method: The authors match the RHTM onto HEFT under various parameter setups and power-counting schemes. They derive pHEFT as a primary formulation, ensuring linear parameter relations and avoiding non-linear constraints. Analyses of the Z2-symmetric real singlet model and two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) are used to validate criteria for viable pHEFT constructions. They introduce fermionic HEFT operators for RHTM.

Result: Establishment of pHEFT as a benchmark framework with enhanced perturbative accuracy. Demonstrated systematic derivation of alternative HEFT constructs from pHEFT. First derivation of fermionic HEFT operators in RHTM. Clarified criteria for selecting suitable UV models with scalar extensions.

Conclusion: pHEFT offers a superior foundational approach for HEFT constructions due to its preservation of UV details and avoidance of restrictive truncations. The method provides a clear path for extending HEFT to other scalar-extended UV models and facilitates precision studies in particle physics.

Abstract: We match the real Higgs triplet model (RHTM) onto HEFT under different parameter choices and power-counting schemes, thereby obtaining several representative HEFT formulations and clarifying their relations. We establish the primary HEFT (pHEFT) as a benchmark framework, demonstrating that alternative HEFT constructions can be systematically derived from it. A key advantage of the pHEFT construction is its parameter choice, which maintains linear relations between the UV Lagrangian parameters and squared heavy masses. By strictly employing the inverse squared heavy masses as the expansion parameters without imposing additional constraints, pHEFT preserves maximal ultraviolet (UV) information and ensures higher perturbative accuracy by avoiding the additional truncations inherent in more complex, non-linear formulations or extra constraints. Through the analysis of the $Z_2$-symmetric real singlet model and the 2HDM, we illustrate the criteria for identifying viable primary HEFT constructions in UV models with scalar extensions. Furthermore, for the first time, we derive the HEFT operators of the RHTM involving fermions.

*Masaki J. S. Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an explicit rephasing transformation to convert any unitary mixing matrix into the Fritzsch--Xing (FX) parametrization. By setting certain matrix elements to zero, they derive a compact expression for the FX phase δFX under specific approximations, showing its dependence on relative phases of lepton diagonalization matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the rephasing invariants in lepton mixing matrices and simplify the expression of the FX phase by applying specific approximations, leading to a better understanding of the phase's origin and dependencies.

Method: Constructing an explicit rephasing transformation to convert a general unitary matrix into the FX parametrization. Analyzing the FX phase δFX under the approximation U13e=0 and extending to U13ν=0, deriving symbolic expressions through matrix diagonalization and phase analysis.

Result: Obtained a concise formula for δFX in terms of elements of charged lepton (Ue) and neutrino (Uν) diagonalization matrices under the approximations. Showed that δFX arises from two relative phases in Ue and Uν, with finite U13ν extending this result.

Conclusion: The FX phase's structure is fundamentally tied to relative phases in lepton mixing matrices. The derived expressions provide a theoretical framework for interpreting empirical measurements of δFX and guide future neutrino experiments by clarifying phase contributions under simplifying assumptions.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct an explicit rephasing transformation that converts an arbitrary unitary mixing matrix into the Fritzsch--Xing (FX) parametrization, which is obtained by trivializing arguments of the matrix elements in the third row and third column. We further analyzed the rephasing invariant structure of the FX phase $δ_{\rm FX}$ under the approximation where the 1-3 element of the diagonalization matrix of charged leptons $U^{e}$ is neglected, $U_{13}^{e} = 0$. As a result, in the limit where the 1-3 element of diagonalization of neutrinos $U^ν$ is also neglected,
  we obtained a compact expression for the FX phase $δ_{\rm FX} = \arg [ { U^{e}_{11} U^{e}_{12} U^{e}_{33} } { U^{ν*}_{11} U^{ν*}_{12} U^{ν*}_{33} / \det U^{e} \det U^{ν*} } ] - \arg [ 1 + ({U^{e *}_{23} U^ν_{23} / U^{e *}_{33} U^ν_{33}} ) ] $. In this limit, the FX phase is controlled by two independent relative phases between $U^{ν, e}$, and the FX phase for finite $U_{13}^ν$ is understood as a generalization to the compact expression.

Motivation: Radiative neutrino mass models face the issue of tree-level contributions dominating over loop contributions when using conventional symmetries like U(1) or Z_M, making it difficult to achieve the looping hierarchy. The authors aim to resolve this problem while also addressing dark matter stability.

Method: The authors introduce non-invertible selection rules (NISRs) as a novel symmetry framework that naturally forbids tree-level interactions without affecting loop contributions. A specific example is the T4-2-$i$ topology, which they realize through a $Z_7$ Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion algebra, demonstrating its application to a type-II one-loop seesaw.

Result: NISRs successfully suppress tree-level terms and ensure dominant one-loop neutrino masses. The same non-invertible structure stabilizes dark matter, providing a unified explanation for both phenomena. The T4-2-$i$ model from $Z_7$ TY algebra serves as a concrete implementation.

Conclusion: The paper establishes NISRs as a promising tool for radiative neutrino mass models, offering a solution to symmetry constraints that previously hindered loop dominance. It also highlights the potential of TY fusion algebras in constructing viable models, suggesting a path forward for unifying neutrino mass and dark matter stability within a single theoretical framework.

Abstract: The topological classification of the one-loop Weinberg operator at dimension-5 enables a systematic categorization of radiative neutrino mass models. Among these, the category consisting loop-extended seesaw frameworks is theoretically appealing but conventional discrete or continuous symmetries (\emph{e.g.}, $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_M$) cannot genuinely forbid the corresponding tree-level contributions, making loop dominance difficult to realize. We show that \textit{non-invertible selection rules} (NISRs) naturally enforce the absence of tree-level terms while ensuring a dominant one-loop contribution. Intriguingly, the same non-invertible structure also stabilizes the dark matter candidate, providing a unified radiative origin of neutrino mass and dark sector stability. In particular, we focus on the T4-2-$i$ topology which embodies a type-II one-loop seesaw and demonstrate its natural realization from $Z_{7}$ Tambara--Yamagami (TY) fusion algebra.

*Ri-Qing Qian,Bing Chen,Xiang Liu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper predicts masses of charmonium hybrids as a $c\bar{c}g$ system within 4.19--4.32 GeV and proposes decay signatures for experimental detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Charmonium hybrids, crucial for understanding nonperturbative QCD, are poorly understood experimentally. Their study helps explore gluonic degrees of freedom in hadrons.

Method: Constituent gluon model treating hybrids as $c\bar{c}g$ three-body systems with transverse electric gluons. Calculated masses via this model and analyzed decay patterns.

Result: Predicted masses for the lightest hybrid multiplet states ($J^{PC}=1^{--}, 0^{-+}, 1^{-+}, 2^{-+}$) between 4.19--4.32 GeV. Identified distinct decay signatures for experimental verification.

Conclusion: Proposes testable experimental signatures to aid in locating these exotic states, guiding searches at particle accelerators.

Abstract: Hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom, such as charmonium hybrids, are key to understanding nonperturbative behavior of strong interaction, yet they remain experimentally elusive. Within a constituent gluon model treating the hybrid as a $c\bar{c}g$ three-body system with a transverse electric gluon, we predict the masses of the lightest hybrid multiplet ($J^{PC}=1^{--}, 0^{-+}, 1^{-+}, 2^{-+}$) to lie in the range $4.19$--$4.32$ GeV. By analyzing their decay patterns, we provide specific, experimentally testable signatures to guide the search for these exotic states at current and future facilities.

### [76] [Dark higher-form fields and triangle anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14839)
*Cypris Plantier,Christopher Smith*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of higher-rank tensor fields to describe light scalar and vector particles, extending previous work to include fermionic triangle loops. It compares standard and higher-form models in two dark matter processes, finding that two-photon decay is especially sensitive to the underlying theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate alternative frameworks using higher-rank tensor fields for dark particles, which offer phenomenological insights beyond standard descriptions and could reveal the true nature of dark sectors through observable processes.

Method: The authors extended existing methods to incorporate fermionic triangle loops, then analyzed pair production of dark particles and their two-photon decay in both standard and higher-form models. Calculations compared dependences on scalar/vector realizations.

Result: While both processes show some dependence on the choice of dark state realization, the two-photon decay channel exhibits heightened sensitivity to the underlying theoretical framework, making it a key probe for distinguishing between models.

Conclusion: The two-photon decay mode emerges as a critical observational window to determine the true nature of dark fields. Higher-form tensor descriptions offer non-trivial alternatives requiring further experimental scrutiny, particularly through precision measurements in two-photon processes.

Abstract: Light scalar and vector particles admit non-trivial descriptions in terms of anti-symmetric higher-rank tensor fields. Far from mere rewritings, these provide compelling alternative frameworks, leading to immediate phenomenological applications. In this paper, we extend the playground to include the contributions of fermionic triangle loops, and use these results to compare the standard and higher-form realizations for two phenomenological processes: the pair production of two dark particles and the decay of a dark particle in two photons. Though they all do show some dependencies on the chosen realizations for the spin-zero or the spin-one dark states, we find that the two-photon mode is particularly sensitive and could actually be our prime window into the true nature of the dark field.

*Wan-Zhe Feng,Zi-Hui Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gauge-independent method to predict gravitational wave signals from first-order phase transitions in a minimal gauged U(1) dark sector, connecting it to dark matter possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome gauge dependence issues in calculating gravitational wave backgrounds from dark sector phase transitions and establish reliable predictions for detection by pulsar timing arrays and space-based interferometers.

Method: Uses Nielsen identity with derivative expansion/power counting to construct gauge-independent effective actions, performs Monte Carlo scans across high-/low-temperature limits, and links microscopic parameters to gravitational wave observables and dark matter candidates.

Result: Supercooled transitions produce strongest signals, high-temperature transitions are rare/weaker. Provides viable dark matter benchmarks (dark photon/fermion) compatible with gravitational wave predictions.

Conclusion: End-to-end pipeline enables reliable gravitational wave spectra and dark matter predictions for minimal U(1) dark sectors, advancing prospects for hidden sector detection via complementary observables.

Abstract: Searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from first-order phase transitions offer a powerful probe of hidden sectors, but quantitative predictions in gauge theories are obstructed by the gauge dependence of the finite-temperature effective potential and the associated tunneling action. We study a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector containing a dark Higgs and a dark photon, optionally supplemented by a vectorlike dark fermion, coupled to the Standard Model through Higgs portal or kinetic mixing. Using the Nielsen identity together with a controlled derivative expansion and power counting, we construct a gauge-independent effective action in the high- and low-temperature limits, enabling model-intrinsic nucleation dynamics and robust gravitational wave predictions. We perform dedicated Monte Carlo scans in both limits and map viable microscopic parameters to detector-facing peak frequencies and amplitudes, spanning bands relevant to pulsar timing arrays and planned space-based interferometers. In our scans, supercooled transitions typically produce the strongest signals, whereas parametrically high-temperature transitions are comparatively rare and tend to be weak. We further connect the phase transition phenomenology to viable dark matter candidates within the same minimal field content, providing benchmark targets for dark photon dark matter and dark fermion dark matter, and highlighting their complementarity with gravitational wave observables. Overall, our results provide an end-to-end, gauge-independent pipeline from a minimal hidden sector Lagrangian to gravitational wave spectra and cosmologically viable dark matter benchmarks, yielding the most reliable and concrete predictions to date for a minimal gauged $U(1)$ dark sector.

### [78] [Parapositronium decay into three photons and implications for the neutral pion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14899)
*Andrzej Czarnecki,Divyesh Dagia,Ting Gao,Ripanjeet Toor*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper completes the calculation of parapositronium decay into three photons via Z boson mediation, finding the amplitude scales as 1/m_Z⁶, similar to W boson contributions, resulting in a much smaller decay rate than previously thought, with implications for π⁰→3γ decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To finalize the determination of parapositronium decay into three photons and assess the impact of the Z boson contribution, addressing discrepancies in previous estimates.

Method: Evaluated amplitudes mediated by Z boson interactions, comparing scaling behaviors with W boson contributions and calculating the total decay rate including both.

Result: The Z boson amplitude starts at 1/m_Z⁶, leading to a combined decay rate of 1.1×10⁻⁸⁰ eV, 47 orders of magnitude smaller than prior estimates. This challenges previous assumptions about mass-dependent enhancements.

Conclusion: The findings refine theoretical predictions for parapositronium decay and suggest reconsideration of analogous decay processes like π⁰→3γ due to the observed scaling behavior.

Abstract: We complete the determination of the parapositronium decay into three photons by evaluating amplitudes mediated by the $Z$ boson. We show that, contrary to the expectation that the extra mass scale $m_e$ may bring an enhancement to the overall scaling, the amplitude turns out to start at $1/m_Z^6$ order, similarly to the $W$ boson mediated amplitude. The decay rate with both $W$ and $Z$ boson contributions is found to be $1.1\cdot 10^{-80}$ eV, about 47 orders of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. We also discuss its implication for the $π^0\to3γ$ amplitude.

### [79] [Probing Quark Electric Dipole Moment with Topological Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14906)
*Chao-Qiang Geng,Xiang-Nan Jin,Chia-Wei Liu,Bin Wu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper identifies CP-odd observables in $γ^*	o K^+K^-π^0$ processes, requiring anomalous couplings from a 5D Chern-Simons term for nonzero T-odd asymmetry $A_T$. Sensitivity estimates for strange-quark EDM are discussed using existing and future experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To search for CP violation signals through T-odd asymmetries in meson decays, which could indicate contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly through the strange-quark electric dipole moment (EDM).

Method: Analyzes CP-odd observables in $γ^*	o K^+K^-π^0$ using chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit. Models the running of $F_A$ and $F_V$ using vector meson dominance to estimate EDM sensitivities from experimental data (e.g., VEPP-2000 CMD-3, BESIII) and proposes future improvements at STCF and Belle II.

Result: Existing experiments (CMD-3, BESIII) can probe strange-quark EDM down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-18})e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ respectively. Future facilities aim to improve this by an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: CP-odd observables in $K^+K^-π^0$ decays offer a viable probe of CP violation and strange-quark EDM. Upgraded experiments can significantly enhance sensitivity to beyond-Standard-Model effects.

Abstract: CP-odd observables are identified in $γ^*\to K^+K^-π^0$ and evaluated in the chiral limit. A nonzero T-odd asymmetry $A_T$ requires anomalous couplings descending from a five-dimensional Chern-Simons construction. Modeling the running of $F_A$ and $F_V$ with the vector meson dominance, we estimate sensitivities to the strange-quark EDM: $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16}),e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ in $e^+e^-$ data at VEPP-2000 (CMD-3) and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-18}),e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ using existing $J/ψ$ samples at BESIII. Future experiments in the Super Tau-Charm Facility and Belle II can further improve the reach by an order of magnitude.

*Nora Brambilla,Mathias Butenschoen,Simon Hibler,Abhishek Mohapatra,Antonio Vairo,Xiangpeng Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper computes inclusive production cross sections for the χ_{c1}(3872) particle and related bottomonium states, as well as pentaquark states (both charmonium and bottomonium versions) using the Born--Oppenheimer effective field theory framework. Results are presented without fitting to experimental hadroproduction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict production cross sections for exotic hadrons (like χ_{c1}(3872) and pentaquarks) using a theoretical framework that avoids fitting experimental data, providing benchmark predictions for future experiments.

Method: Applied Born--Oppenheimer effective field theory factorization to compute cross sections for both charmonium and bottomonium systems. Considered two scenarios for the Born--Oppenheimer potentials when calculating pentaquark states.

Result: Generated genuine predictions for production cross sections of χ_{c1}(3872), its bottomonium partner, and four pentaquark states in both charmonium and bottomonium sectors without reliance on experimental data fitting.

Conclusion: The approach successfully provides theory-driven predictions for exotic hadron production, offering testable hypotheses for future particle physics experiments and insights into the dynamics of exotic hadron formation.

Abstract: We use the Born--Oppenheimer effective field theory factorization to compute the inclusive production cross sections of the $χ_{c1}(3872)$ and its partner in the bottomonium sector. In the same framework, we compute the production cross sections of the pentaquark states $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4380)^+$ and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)^+$ within two possible scenarios for the Born--Oppenheimer potentials. Also for pentaquarks, we extend the results to the bottomonium sector. All our results are genuine predictions that do not involve fits to prompt hadroproduction data.

### [81] [Complementarity of di-top and four-top searches in interpreting possible signals of new physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15027)
*Henning Bahl,Philipp Gadow,Romal Kumar,Krisztian Peters,Panagiotis Stylianou,Georg Weiglein*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study emphasizes the importance of considering loop-level mixing effects in analyses of top-quark final states at the LHC, particularly when searching for high-mass scalar particles beyond the Standard Model. While di-top channels have larger signal cross sections, they suffer from significant interference with QCD backgrounds and self-interference between signals, complicating the interpretation of potential anomalies. In contrast, four-top final states, though less common, offer cleaner signals with minimal background interference, providing complementary data crucial for accurately determining new physics models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying deviations from the Standard Model in top-quark final states at the LHC, especially when multiple high-mass scalars are involved. The authors aim to highlight the necessity of accounting for loop-level mixing effects and interference phenomena to improve the accuracy of exclusion limits and avoid misinterpretations of experimental results.

Method: The analysis investigates interference patterns in di-top (two top quarks) and four-top final states. It evaluates both signal-background interference and signal-signal interference contributions when multiple high-mass scalars exist. The study uses theoretical calculations to show how loop-level mixing impacts these interferences and evaluates the diagnostic value of four-top channels in clarifying ambiguous di-top results.

Result: The authors demonstrate that neglecting loop-level mixing leads to inaccurate exclusion limits, as interference effects can mask or mimic new physics signals in di-top channels. Four-top final states are shown to have negligible background interference, offering a clearer probe of new physics despite lower cross-sections. This dual-channel approach is essential for robustly interpreting LHC data.

Conclusion: Both di-top and four-top final states are critical for uncovering beyond-Standard-Model physics. While di-top channels provide higher sensitivity, their results must be corroborated with four-top analyses to disentangle interference effects. This combined strategy ensures precise determination of new physics scenarios and reliable exclusion bounds, necessitating loop-level mixing considerations in future experimental analyses.

Abstract: Final states comprising two or more top quarks are important search channels at the Large Hadron Collider for scalar particles predicted in models of physics beyond the Standard Model. While the di-top final state profits from a higher signal cross section, it can be subject to intricate interference patterns. Besides the interference with the large QCD background, in case of the presence of more than one high-mass scalar also large signal--signal interference contributions can occur. We show that in such scenarios it is crucial to account for loop-level mixing for obtaining accurate exclusion bounds. We demonstrate how the interference patterns can obscure the interpretation of possible deviations from the Standard Model expectations. We show that the four-top final state, while giving rise to a smaller signal cross section, provides important complementary information due to its much smaller signal--background interference contributions. Thus, the results obtained from the four-top final state can be instrumental for pinpointing the underlying new physics scenario.
