As a consequence, it is not only a solution in General Relativity, but also in Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theories for all coupling constants. The specific case of Entangled Relativity is noteworthy because the additional scalar degree of freedom is defined from the ratio between $R$ and $\\mathcal{L}_m$, which is ill-defined in this situation. In the present work, we embed the Mineur--Vaidya solution in a magnetic (or electric) field within the framework of Entangled Relativity, and show that the Mineur--Vaidya solution corresponds to the limit where the magnetic (respectively, electric) field vanishes. This notably allows us to demonstrate that, as in General Relativity, it is possible to dynamically form naked singularities in Entangled Relativity. This conclusion, in fact, applies to any Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theory, although it does not seem to be widely acknowledged in the literature."}

Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions."}

Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with \"hair\"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity."}

In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys."}

The models which best match the mass distributions correspond to explosions of binary-merger blue supergiant progenitors; at least two such models approximately reproduce the observed CO morphology. In contrast, the SiO velocity distribution and morphology are not as well reproduced in these models, indicating insufficient mixing of Si into the outer layers already at the progenitor stage. The theoretical models suggest a strong correlation between the centre of mass of the densest carbon- and oxygen-rich ejecta and the direction of the neutron-star kick.

The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves."}

These objects can switch between two emission regimes: rotation-powered radio pulsar and accreting X-ray pulsar. The origin of their optical and X-ray pulsations is still debated, although one model attributes them to synchrotron emission produced in a shock between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow. The small phase lag observed between optical and X-ray pulses in PSR J1023+0038 supports a common origin. We present a new measurement of the phase lag between optical and X-ray pulse profiles of PSR J1023+0038 and investigate the evolution of the time of passage at the ascending node ($T_{\\rm{asc}}$) up to 2023. We performed a timing analysis of optical observations obtained with Aqueye+ between 2021 and 2023 and of X-ray data from NICER in 2023. We derive updated values of $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ and measure the optical - X-ray phase lag from simultaneous observations. We find that $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ increases by about 20 s per year. In January 2023, we measure a phase lag of $0.067 \\pm 0.018$, corresponding to $112.3 \\pm 30.7\\,μ$s. Since 2017, the evolution of $T_{\\rm{asc}}$ follows a parabolic trend, indicating an increase in the orbital period and orbital separation of the system. This behaviour is consistent with non-conservative Roche-lobe overflow, with the donor losing mass at a rate much higher than the accretion rate. The phase lag measurement further supports a common origin of the optical and X-ray pulsations."}

In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes."}

However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\\gtrsim20\\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\\gtrsim125\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\,\\mathrm{b}$ at $90\\%$ credibility by the end of O4.

In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state ($CL_4$) for fermionic fields in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations. Moreover, our results indicate that, within a relativistic framework, the $CL_4$ state constitutes a high-quality quantum resource with potential applications in relativistic quantum information processing, and may significantly improve the performance of such protocols."}

However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\\gtrsim20\\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\\gtrsim125\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\,\\mathrm{b}$ at $90\\%$ credibility by the end of O4.

One way to disentangle different contributions to the GWB is to search for anisotropic signatures. In this work, we search for anisotropy in the GWB using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Our analysis employs both the radiometer method and the spherical harmonic basis to characterize the distribution of GWB power across the sky. We calculate the angular power in the lowest five frequency bins and compare it with detection thresholds determined under the null hypothesis of isotropy. In the 5.26 nHz frequency bin, we identify a hotspot in the reconstructed sky map with a $p$-value of $0.016$ (the lowest in our analysis), which we attribute to noise fluctuations.

Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically.

We address this issue through flux-resolved, broadband (0.8-20 keV) spectral modelling and simultaneous covariance spectral analysis during two $κ$ and two $ω$ class observations using \\textit{AstroSat}/SXT and LAXPC. The lightcurves show strong, quasi-periodic oscillations involving rapid transitions between bright bursts and deep dips on timescales of a few tens of seconds. Flux-resolved spectroscopy indicates that high-flux intervals in both classes are dominated by a hot, optically thick accretion disc with steep Comptonized emission, whereas low-flux intervals correspond to a cooler or partially recessed disc and a harder coronal continuum. These transitions involve a systematic 1-2 keV drop in disc temperature and a pronounced hardening of the Comptonized component, with flux reductions of up to a factor of five. Using covariance spectra across 0.015-5 Hz, we show that the rapid coherent variability arises almost entirely from the disc, which exhibits strong energy-dependent variations, while the Comptonized component contributes minimally. The combined results suggest that radiation-pressure-driven structural changes in the disc, with a slower coronal response, produce the observed oscillations, consistent with cyclic disc evacuation and refilling in the $κ$ and $ω$ classes."}

This note explores these assumptions by computing correction terms in powers of $m/E$ up to order $(m/E)^4$. The assumptions are found to be robust: not only is the leading correction quadratic in $m/E$, but also cancellations reduce its coefficient and that of the next-to-leading correction, which is of order $(m/E)^4$. Three- and four-particle systems are also treated and the generalisation to larger numbers of particles indicated. The zeroth-order expressions for these multi-particle systems are remarkably simple; they deserve to be better known."}

Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms. By analyzing waveform dephasing and mismatches, we show that a fully relativistic treatment of DM distributions can substantially alter the detectability thresholds of DM halos. Our results demonstrate that radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for accurately describing the dynamics and observational signatures of EMRIs embedded in DM halos."}

The screen coincides with the HII region JCMTSE~J180921.2$-$201932 and is unrelated to the magnetar's 2018 outburst suggested by earlier studies. A scintillation arc detected at 14.0~GHz represents the highest-frequency arc observed to date. The asymmetry of arcs is linearly correlated with a dispersion-measure gradient across the screen ($r = 0.959$, $p < 10^{-8}$). We also measure its refractive scintillation timescale, which is only $1.21\\pm0.19$~d. Clear DISS at 14~GHz effectively resolves the debate over a possible strong-to-weak scattering transition at this frequency.

We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(ζ_c \\sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses.

Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe.

We develop a semi-analytical general relativistic framework that extends classical compressional amplification models by incorporating rotational shear, and apply it to large-scale poloidal magnetic field evolution in accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. By parameterizing the azimuthal velocity as a fraction of the Keplerian value ($ξ\\in [0,1]$), from purely radial infall ($ξ=0$) to Keplerian rotation ($ξ=1$), we examine the combined effects of radial compression and shear. Purely radial flows maximize amplification of both $B_r$ and $B_θ$ due to strong compression. In rotating flows, a distinct dichotomy emerges: sub-Keplerian regimes ($ξ<1$) preferentially enhance $B_r$, whereas Keplerian rotation strengthens $B_θ$ via shear. The transition from subsonic outer regions to supersonic relativistic inner regions further accelerates magnetic growth, revealing effects absent in earlier analytical treatments. These results show that rotational support controls both amplification efficiency and magnetic geometry, with sub-Keplerian phases particularly favorable for advecting the radial flux required for MAD formation. This work provides an analytical bridge between classical accretion theory and modern GRMHD simulations, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGNs, and EHT-scale systems."}

The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations."}

These images are fundamentally related to properties of the luminous accretion disks, since black holes themselves produce no light.

We apply our model to the original EHT image of M87*, as well as to the reanalyzed image from the PRIMO algorithm, providing generic, simultaneous constraints on the mass of the black hole and properties of the accretion disk emission. While current images lack the resolution to confidently detect the photon ring, the consideration of multiple image parameters are found to contain enough information to provide constraints on the inner edge of the accretion disk along with the black hole mass. Using observed features of the original EHT image, we constrain the mass of M87* to be $6.6^{+1.2}_{-1.0}\\times 10^9 M_\\odot$ to 68$\\%$ confidence, and find that emission may extend all the way to the black hole horizon.

Both analyses rule out an inner edge of the accretion disk coinciding with the innermost stable circular orbit for a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the narrow ring width reported in the PRIMO image also confidently rules out emission increasing all the way down to the black hole horizon. Further assumptions on the mass of M87* and connections between the accretion disk cutoff and physical radii allow for rudimentary black hole spin estimates."}

As the chemical potential increases from zero, these quantities rise in both the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. In contrast, introducing a magnetic field suppresses them at low temperatures but enhances them at high temperatures. Furthermore, nonzero chemical potential and magnetic field introduce nontrivial modifications to the squared speed of sound $c_s^2$. Both effects increase $c_s^2$ close to the critical temperature while reducing it at lower temperatures. When the chemical potential and magnetic field are present simultaneously, their influences superimpose, leading to more intricate changes in the thermodynamic behavior.

While some of their spectroscopic features have been analysed in detail, the appearance of broad absorptions in the optical regime has been traditionally neglected. In this work, we introduce the first population study dedicated to these features with the aim to understand their fundamental properties and discuss them in the context of their origin. We complement the study with a spectroscopic database of six low-mass X-ray binaries during outburst, in order to assess their evolution. We find that broad absorptions are ubiquitous, with the majority of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries exhibiting them in spite of a typically scarce outburst coverage. Their detection does not depend on the orbital inclination or the compact object nature, but they seem favoured in systems with orbital periods shorter than < 11 h. They predominantly occur in the hydrogen Balmer series, being stronger at shorter wavelengths, and they are detected across all X-ray states. We find that the normalised depth of these broad absorptions is anti-correlated with the system luminosity, and that they show constant line ratios over the whole sample. Based on these properties, we favour a scenario where BAs arise from a stable, optically thick layer of the accretion disc, below the hotter chromosphere-like region producing the emission line components. Our study is consistent with the continuous presence of broad absorptions during the whole outburst, with their visibility being conditioned by the emission lines filling the broad absorption profile and veiling by the X-ray reprocessed continuum."}

In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys."}

However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\\gtrsim20\\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\\gtrsim125\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\,\\mathrm{b}$ at $90\\%$ credibility by the end of O4.

We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward."}

A major challenge is that while the pseudoscalar-meson couplings are well-determined, the couplings for scalar- and vector-meson exchanges render significant model dependence. To ensure the reliability of our predictions and reduce model dependence, we recalibrate the coupling constants of the OBE model. We treat the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$, or equivalently the scalar $σ$-exchange coupling constant, as the only unknown parameter. The coupling constants for the vector $ρ$- and $ω$-exchanges are determined by the pole positions of the well established states $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. We demonstrate that these parameter sets also successfully describe the $T_{cs0}(2870)$ without further tuning. For the three-body system, our results indicate that an $I\\left(J^P\\right)=1 / 2\\left(0^{-}\\right)$ three-body molecular bound state exists when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state located within approximately $-10~\\text{MeV}$ of the $D\\bar{D}^*$ threshold.

We also apply this formalism to the bottom analog $BB^*K^*$ system. In this sector, the conditions for the existence of a three-body bound state are more relaxed, as a $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state located within $-25~\\text{MeV}$ below the threshold suffices, although three-body molecular resonances remain absent. We suggest that future experiments precisely measure the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$ or search for the three-body bound state in $DD\\bar{K}ππ$ and $DD\\bar{K}$ channels, as these efforts would mutually illuminate the nature of the associated states."}

In this work, we develop a new quark-level RGM formalism for baryon-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies, with the aim of describing both single baryons and baryon-baryon interactions in a consistent framework. We present the formalism for solving bound-state and scattering problems, with particular emphasis on constructing the wave functions of two-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies. The proposed formalism is then applied to the $NΔ$ system within a chiral SU(3) quark model, where the quark-quark interaction includes, in addition to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) and a phenomenological confinement potential, the nonet scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(3) symmetry.

This stability requires no ad hoc symmetry and renders Kaluza-Klein dark matter a well-motivated candidate, provided it reproduces the observed relic abundance. The minimal UED (mUED) framework being highly predictive is strongly constrained by the combined requirements of relic density and collider searches under standard cosmological assumptions. We revisit the dark matter phenomenology of mUED in the presence of a nonstandard cosmological history featuring a low reheating temperature driven by prolonged inflaton decay. Solving the coupled Boltzmann equations for dark matter, radiation, and inflaton energy densities, we show that entropy injection during reheating can dilute the relic abundance by orders of magnitude, reopening large regions of parameter space previously ruled out. We further demonstrate that the revived parameter space is consistent with current collider, direct-detection, and indirect-detection constraints, while remaining testable by upcoming experiments."}

Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe.

The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations."}
