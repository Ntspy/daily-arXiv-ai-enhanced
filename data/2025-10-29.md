### [1] [Shock Acceleration in the Intracluster Medium: Implications of Micromirror Confinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23700)
*Rebecca Diesing,Ludwig Böss,Damiano Caprioli*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Galaxy cluster mergers efficiently accelerate cosmic rays via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), but their maximum proton energy is limited by high diffusion coefficients. However, the mirror instability generates micromirrors that suppress diffusion, enabling acceleration up to ~100 GeV and aligning with γ-ray observations. A simulation of a Coma-like cluster incorporating micromirrors confirms this mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether mirror instability-induced micromirrors in the ICM can resolve the tension between expected cosmic ray diffusion limitations and observed gamma-ray data, demonstrating their role in enabling efficient proton acceleration.

Method: Theoretical analysis of CR acceleration dynamics considering mirror instability effects; cosmological simulations of a Coma-like merging cluster with micromirror-constrained diffusion coefficients, comparing simulated gamma-ray outputs to observations.

Result: Micromirrors enforce a minimum E_max ~100 GeV without requiring magnetic field amplification. Simulations with micromirror effects reproduce gamma-ray observations consistent with real data.

Conclusion: Micromirror confinement is critical for achieving sufficient cosmic ray energies in cluster mergers, maintaining observational consistency without relying on traditional magnetic field amplification mechanisms.

Abstract: Merging galaxy clusters exhibit strong observational evidence for efficient
particle acceleration in the intracluster medium (ICM), particularly in the
form of synchrotron-emitting radio relics and halos. Cosmic ray (CR) electrons
are likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large
diffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively
unmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy
($E_{\rm max}$)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand,
recent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be
suppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local
thermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating
plasma-scale magnetic structures, or "micromirrors," that efficiently scatter
CRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement
for shock acceleration in the ICM. We demonstrate that micromirrors enforce a
minimum value of $E_{\rm max} \gtrsim 100$ GeV that does not rely on CR-driven
magnetic field amplification. We also discuss micromirror confinement in the
context of cosmological simulations and $\gamma$-ray observations, and present
a simulation of a Coma-like merging cluster that self-consistently includes CR
acceleration at shocks, with an effective diffusion coefficient set by
micromirrors. We show that the introduction of micromirrors yields simulated
galaxy clusters that remain consistent with $\gamma$-ray observations.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the gravitational wave candidate S250818k and its potential optical counterpart AT2025ulz. Key findings include confirmation of the transient's host galaxy redshift, linking it to the gravitational wave event, and highlighting the role of DESI in identifying such events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the association between the sub-threshold gravitational wave signal S250818k and the optical transient AT2025ulz, which exhibited both kilonova and supernova features, and to better understand the environment of such mergers through host galaxy analysis.

Method: The authors used DESI spectra to measure the host galaxy's redshift, analyzed its spectral energy distribution, and conducted follow-up observations with the Fraunhofer Telescope to confirm the transient's properties and host characteristics.

Result: A precise redshift (z=0.084840±0.000006) was obtained, placing the transient within 2σ of the gravitational wave distance. The host was identified as a dusty star-forming galaxy, consistent with environments of short GRBs and supernovae. The overlap between the gravitational wave localization and transient position was quantified.

Conclusion: DESI's spectral data effectively enabled rapid characterization of the host galaxy, aiding in associating electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events. The study underscores the importance of multi-messenger astronomy and DESI's role in future transient follow-up.

Abstract: On August 18th, 2025, the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaboration reported a
sub-threshold gravitational wave candidate detection consistent with a
sub-solar-mass neutron star merger, denoted S250818k. An optical transient,
AT2025ulz, was discovered within the localization region. AT2025ulz initially
appeared to meet the expected behavior of kilonova (KN) emission, the telltale
signature of a binary neutron star merger. The transient subsequently
rebrightened after $\sim$\,$5$ days and developed spectral features
characteristic of a Type IIb supernova. In this work, we analyze the
observations of the host galaxy of AT2025ulz obtained by the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). From the DESI spectrum, we obtain a secure
redshift of $z = 0.084840 \pm 0.000006$, which places the transient within
$2\sigma$ of the gravitational wave distance and results in an integral overlap
between the gravitational wave alert and the transient location of
$\log_{10}\mathcal{I} \approx 3.9-4.2$. Our analysis of the host galaxy's
spectral energy distribution reveals a star-forming, dusty galaxy with stellar
mass ${\sim} 10^{10}~M_\odot$, broadly consistent with the population of both
short gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernova host galaxies. We also
present our follow-up of DESI-selected candidate host galaxies using the
Fraunhofer Telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory, and show the promise of
DESI for associating or rejecting candidate electromagnetic counterparts to
gravitational wave alerts. These results emphasize the value of DESI's
extensive spectroscopic dataset in rapidly characterizing host galaxies,
enabling spectroscopic host subtraction, and guiding targeted follow-up.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) are frequently observed to have strong magnetic fields up
to $10^9$ G and expected to have a possible internal field as high as $\sim
10^{14}$ G. High internal fields can significantly deform a WD's equilibrium
structure, generating a quadrupole moment. If the rotation axis is misaligned
with the magnetic axis, the deformation can lead to the emission of continuous
gravitational waves (CGWs). We examine the potential for detecting CGWs from
magnetized WDs with future space-based detectors such as LISA, ALIA, DECIGO,
Deci-Hz, BBO and TianQin. We model the field-induced deformation and compute
the resulting GW strain, incorporating amplitude decay due to angular momentum
loss from electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. This sets a timescale
for detection -`active timescale' of $10^{5-6}$ yr, requiring observation while
the object remains sufficiently young. Our results suggest that LISA could
detect a few dozens of highly magnetized WDs across the Galaxy during its
mission. As a specific case, we investigate ZTF J1901+1458- a compact, massive,
fast-rotating, and strongly magnetized WD with spin period $\sim416$ s and
inferred surface field $\sim10^{9}$ G. We find that this object would be
detectable by LISA with four years of continuous data. This highlights the
potential of CGW observations to probe magnetic field structure in WDs and
their role in type Ia supernova progenitors.

### [4] [AT2025ulz and S250818k: Deep X-ray and radio limits on off-axis afterglow emission and prospects for future discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23728)
*Brendan O'Connor,Roberto Ricci,Eleonora Troja,Antonella Palmese,Yu-Han Yang,Geoffrey Ryan,Hendrik van Eerten,Muskan Yadav,Xander J. Hall,Ariel Amsellem,Rosa L. Becerra,Malte Busmann,Tomas Cabrera,Simone Dichiara,Lei Hu,Ravjit Kaur,Keerthi Kunnumkai,Ignacio Magana Hernandez*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of the binary neutron star merger candidate S250818k and its optical counterpart AT2025ulz shows no conclusive evidence for an electromagnetic (EM)-gravitational wave (GW) detection. Observations using multiple telescopes ruled out an afterglow, leading to the reclassification of AT2025ulz as a stripped-envelope supernova. The study provides constraints on hypothetical afterglow parameters and viewing angles for such events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The long wait since GW170817 for a second EM-GW detection necessitates further investigation of candidates like S250818k to confirm or rule out multi-messenger signals, ensuring progress in understanding compact object mergers.

Method: The team conducted rapid optical follow-up and initiated observations with Swift, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and the Very Large Array to search for non-thermal X-ray and radio afterglow emission. They analyzed data to compare observed limits with theoretical afterglow models.

Result: The optical rebrightening of AT2025ulz was not linked to an afterglow, confirming it as a supernova. Derived constraints show no GW170817-like afterglow within 12.5 degrees viewing angle at 400 Mpc distance.

Conclusion: The failed confirmation highlights challenges in detecting off-axis EM-GW events, emphasizing the need for advanced observational strategies and future collaborations to detect elusive multi-messenger signals.

Abstract: The first joint electromagentic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) detection,
known as GW170817, marked a critical juncture in our collective understanding
of compact object mergers. However, it has now been 8 years since this
discovery, and the search for a second EM-GW detection has yielded no robust
discoveries. Recently, on August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration
reported a low-significance (high false alarm rate) binary neutron star merger
candidate S250818k. Rapid optical follow-up revealed a single optical candidate
AT2025ulz ($z=0.08484$) that initially appeared consistent with kilonova
emission. We quickly initiated a set of observations with \textit{Swift},
\textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Chandra}, and the Very Large Array to search for
non-thermal afterglow emission. Our deep X-ray and radio search rules out that
the optical rebrightening of AT2025ulz is related to the afterglow onset,
reinforcing its classification as a stripped-envelope supernova (SN 2025ulz).
We derive constraints on the afterglow parameters for a hypothetical binary
neutron star merger at the distance of AT2025ulz ($\approx 400$ Mpc) based on
our X-ray and radio limits. We conclude that our observational campaign could
exclude a GW170817-like afterglow out to viewing angles of
$\theta_\textrm{v}\approx 12.5$ degrees. We briefly discuss the prospects for
the future discovery of off-axis afterglows.

### [5] [Hydrodynamic Simulations of Tidal Disruption Encores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23729)
*Ian P. A. Johnson,Taeho Ryu,Rosalba Perna*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper uses hydrodynamic simulations with AREPO to study Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters, showing how disruption geometry, MBH mass, and separation affect debris morphology and luminosity, leading to ring or direct encores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictions of TDEE lightcurves and enable observational insights into NSC dynamics and sBH populations through detailed simulation of post-disruption stellar debris behavior.

Method: Performed hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO, varying parameters like disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation to analyze debris dynamics and resulting lightcurves.

Result: Identified two distinct TDEE morphologies (ring and direct encores) with luminosities of 10^40-10^42 erg/s, peaking at freefall timescale or orbital period, providing clear lightcurve signatures.

Conclusion: Enhances understanding of TDEE characteristics, aiding observational detection and offering explanations for unusual TDE-like flares while enabling probes of NSC environments and sBH distributions.

Abstract: We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal
Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a
stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris
that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central
massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that
the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively
on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two
distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a
torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore
luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one
orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events
exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic
of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE
lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH
population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational
waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this
event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one
neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the
coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that
was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger.
The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like
kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young,
stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule
out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the
possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have
been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently
merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse
supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our
multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future
higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star
mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve
this tantalizing multi-messenger association.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present the first detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission potentially
associated with the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) hosted by the young core-collapse
supernova remnant G292.0+1.8, based on a detailed time-resolved analysis of
\textit{Fermi}-LAT data. By isolating the unpulsed component from the dominant
magnetospheric radiation of PSR~J1124$-$5916, we successfully disentangle a
candidate nebular emission in the GeV range, characterise its morphology and
extract its spectrum. This identification places G292.0+1.8 among the few
systems in which the pulsar and PWN contributions have been spectrally resolved
at high energies, offering new insight into their respective emission
mechanisms. We characterise the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the pulsar and model
the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the PWN using radio, X-ray,
and GeV data. The emission is well described by a single electron population
with two spectral breaks: one intrinsic to the injection spectrum and another
produced by synchrotron cooling in a magnetic field of $\sim$15~$\mu$G.
Notably, the inferred magnetic field and the low TeV flux of the nebula
resemble those of 3C~58, suggesting that similar low-field environments can
arise in young PWNe. The high-energy portion of the SED is now tightly
constrained by our GeV detection and existing TeV upper limits. Compared to our
model, earlier predictions tend to underpredict the $\gamma$-ray flux, while
others that succeed in reproducing the GeV component often overpredict the TeV
emission. This mismatch underscores the challenges in modelling particle
acceleration and radiation processes in young PWNe and establishes G292.0+1.8
as a valuable benchmark for testing and refining such models.

### [8] [Study of Neutron Star Properties under the Two-Flavor Quark NJL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23750)
*Chunran Zhu,Bolin Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates hadron-quark hybrid stars using a combined BSR6-NJL model, achieving a hybrid equation of state (EOS) that smoothly transitions between phases. This EOS satisfies mass and radius constraints from pulsars and tidal deformability limits from gravitational wave observations, resolving apparent tensions between high-mass neutron stars and small tidal deformabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To precisely understand the composition and phase behavior of ultra-dense matter in neutron stars, address the tension between observations of high-mass pulsars (e.g., PSR J0740+6620) and constraints on tidal deformabilities from events like GW170817, and validate effective models describing chiral symmetry restoration in dense quark matter.

Method: Combines hadronic matter modeled via the BSR6 relativistic mean-field model with quark matter described by a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. A quintic polynomial ensures continuous and thermodynamically consistent phase crossover. Solves Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to derive neutron star macroscopic properties.

Result: The hybrid EOS predicts a maximum neutron star mass aligning with PSR J0740+6620 observations, while 1.4 solar mass star radii and tidal deformabilities (Λ) match NICER and GW170817 constraints. Resolves discrepancies between high-mass pulsars and low tidal deformability requirements.

Conclusion: Demonstrates self-consistent modeling of hadron-quark crossover phases in neutron stars, providing a unified framework that satisfies multi-messenger astrophysical constraints. Strengthens understanding of dense matter EOS and chiral symmetry dynamics in extreme conditions.

Abstract: The Equation of State (EOS) of matter within neutron stars is a central topic
in nuclear physics and astrophysics. A precise understanding of the composition
and phase behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is crucial for
uncovering the fundamental laws of the strong interaction. This study
investigates hadron-quark hybrid stars using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
(NJL) model. As an effective theory, this model can describe the generation of
dynamical quark masses and chiral symmetry restoration characteristic of dense
quark matter.
  We construct the hybrid EOS by joining the BSR6 relativistic mean-field model
for hadronic matter with the NJL model for quark matter. A quintic polynomial
interpolation ensures a smooth ($C^2$ continuity) and thermodynamically
consistent crossover between the phases. Based on this hybrid EOS, we solve the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to calculate macroscopic properties
of neutron stars, such as the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationship and the tidal
deformability parameter ($\Lambda$).
  By exploring key model parameters, we identify a region satisfying a wide
range of multi-messenger constraints. Our resulting EOS supports a maximum mass
consistent with PSR J0740+6620, while simultaneously predicting radii and tidal
deformabilities for a $1.4M_{\odot}$ star that agree with NICER observations
and limits from GW170817. This work thus presents a self-consistent model that
resolves the tension between high-mass pulsars and small tidal deformabilities,
deepening our understanding of the hadron-quark crossover.

### [9] [Unveiling the soft X-ray source population towards the inner Galactic disk with XMM-Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23814)
*Tong Bao,Gabriele Ponti,Frank Haberl,Samaresh Mondal,Mark R. Morris,Kaya Mori,Shifra Mandel,Xiao-jie Xu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of eRASS1 X-ray sources in the inner Galactic disk reveals that most are coronal sources, particularly active stars and binaries, with a significant fraction being massive stars and compact objects. An empirical hardness-ratio cut effectively isolates non-coronal sources, and about 6% of GRXE flux in the 0.5-2 keV band is resolved into point sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify and characterize faint X-ray sources in the eROSITA survey towards the inner Galactic disk, overcoming past limitations imposed by sensitivity constraints.

Method: Analyzing 189 eRASS1 sources using X-ray spectral fitting (0.2-10 keV) combined with Gaia data. Applied an empirical hardness-ratio cut (HR > -0.2) to distinguish non-coronal sources.

Result: Identified ~74% as coronal sources (active stars/binaries), ~8% as wind-powered massive stars, and ~18% as accreting compact objects. ~6% of GRXE flux in 0.5-2 keV band is resolved into point sources, dominated by active stars in soft band and X-ray binaries in hard band.

Conclusion: eRASS1 contains a notable population of compact objects distinguishable via X-ray color selection, and faint X-ray emission in the Galactic disk is dominated by coronal and binary sources.

Abstract: Across the Galactic disk lies a diverse population of X-ray sources, with the
fainter end remaining poorly understood due to past survey sensitivity limits.
We aim to classify and characterize faint X-ray sources detected in the eROSITA
All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) towards the inner Galactic disk ($350^\circ < l <
360^\circ$, $-1^\circ < b < 1^\circ$) using deeper XMM-Newton observations
(typical exposure of $\sim 20\,\text{ks}$). We analyzed 189 eRASS1 sources,
combining X-ray spectral fitting ($0.2$--$10\,\text{keV}$) with Gaia
astrometric and photometric data for robust classification. Our results show
that the eRASS1 catalog towards the Galactic disk is overwhelmingly dominated
by coronal sources ($\sim 74\%$), primarily active stars and binaries, with
$\sim 8\%$ being wind-powered massive stars and $\sim 18\%$ being accreting
compact objects. We propose an empirical hardness-ratio cut ($\text{HR} >
-0.2$) to efficiently isolate these non-coronal sources. By stacking the
classified population and comparing with the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission
(GRXE), we estimate that $\sim 6\%$ of the GRXE flux in the
$0.5$--$2.0\,\text{keV}$ band is resolved into point sources above the eRASS1
flux limit ($\sim 5\times
10^{-14}\,\text{erg}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$). This resolved soft-band
emission is dominated by active stars, while hard-band flux originates
primarily from X-ray binaries. We conclude that the eRASS1 catalog retains a
non-negligible population of compact objects that can be effectively
distinguished using X-ray color selection.

### [10] [Testing common approximations of neutrino fast flavor conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23917)
*Erick Urquilla,Luke Johns*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in current approximations of fast flavor conversion (FFC) in simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, highlighting three key factors: discretely handling instabilities, using spatially homogeneous states, and linking FFC with instability. These considerations are crucial for advancing from exploratory studies to precise assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing FFC simulations and guide future research toward more accurate models by identifying critical approximations that constrain current studies.

Method: The authors use numerical experiments to analyze and critique the current approximations of FFC, examining their underlying assumptions and identifying factors that limit their accuracy.

Result: They demonstrate that existing FFC approximations are constrained by three main factors: discrete instability treatment, spatially homogeneous assumptions, and the necessity of instability for FFC. These factors affect the reliability of current simulations.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to revise current modeling approaches to overcome these limitations, ensuring future studies achieve higher quantitative precision in understanding astrophysical phenomena like supernovae and neutron star mergers.

Abstract: A new chapter is opening in the theory of core-collapse supernovae and
neutron star mergers as simulations of these events begin to incorporate fast
flavor conversion (FFC) and other forms of neutrino flavor mixing. Using
numerical experiments, we show that the approximations of FFC that have been
implemented so far are limited by at least two of three factors: (1)
approximating continuous evolution as a discrete sequence of instabilities, (2)
using spatially homogeneous asymptotic states, and (3) assuming that FFC must
be accompanied by instability. The factors we identify in this work will be
important considerations as the research area progresses from initial
exploratory studies to more quantitatively precise assessments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are classified as long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs) with
collapsars and compact object mergers (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-Black hole)
as progenitors, respectively. The former are expected to follow the cosmic star
formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR.
However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most
prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at
low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in
arXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift
LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are
compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift
LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers.
Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than
200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use
a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has
increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we
add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning
(ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985). This, in addition to increasing the sample
size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of
redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric,
non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation
between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us
to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the
luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample
with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which
tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.

Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). It consists of a swarm of 16U CubeSats carrying a
state-of-the-art Compton polarimeter and a BGO spectrometer to perform timing,
spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements of the prompt emission from GRBs.
The mission is currently in a feasibility study phase (Phase A) with the
European Space Agency to prepare an in-orbit demonstration. Here, we present
the simulation work used to optimise the design and operational concept of the
microsatellite constellation, as well as estimate the mission performance in
terms of GRB detection rate and polarimetry. We used the MEGAlib software to
simulate the response function of the gamma-ray instruments, together with a
detailed model for the background particle and radiation fluxes in low-Earth
orbit. We also developed a synthetic GRB population model to best estimate the
detection rate. These simulations show that COMCUBE-S will detect about 2 GRBs
per day, which is significantly higher than that of all past and current GRB
missions. Furthermore, simulated performance for linear polarisation
measurements shows that COMCUBE-S will be able to uniquely distinguish between
competing models of the GRB prompt emission, thereby shedding new light on some
of the most fundamental aspects of GRB physics.

### [13] [Rest-frame Optical Spectroscopy of $z \sim 2$ Quasars with Steep Hard X-ray Spectral Shapes: X-ray Selection of Super-Eddington Accretion and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23979)
*Ying Chen,Bin Luo,Jian Huang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explores using steep X-ray photon indices to identify super-Eddington accreting quasars, finding weaker [O III] and stronger Fe II optical features. Near-infrared spectra of nine quasars show mixed results, with potential outflow signs but needing larger samples for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify super-Eddington accreting quasars observationally due to challenges in accurate black hole mass estimates and limitations of Eddington ratios in this regime. Explore alternative selection criteria using X-ray and optical spectral features.

Method: Obtained Palomar Hale Telescope near-infrared spectra for nine quasars with steep X-ray photon indices (Γ=2.0-2.6) at redshifts z≈1.4-2.5. Derived black hole masses using Hβ single-epoch virial method and compared optical features ([O III], Fe II) with a flux-limited comparison sample.

Result: Median black hole mass: 4.3×10^8 M_sun; median Eddington ratio ~0.6, similar to comparison sample. Found statistically significant weaker [O III] (p=0.0075) and marginally stronger Fe II (p=0.06). One object shows broad/blueshifted [O III], suggesting outflows from super-Eddington accretion.

Conclusion: Steep X-ray photon-index selection shows promise for identifying super-Eddington accreting quasars but requires larger samples for robust validation.pectral features like weak [O III] and Fe II emission support this selection, though outflow evidence emphasizes the need for further study.

Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase in the growth of supermassive
black holes. However, identifying super-Eddington accreting quasars
observationally is challenging due to uncertain black-hole mass estimates and
other complications. The Eddington ratio parameter does not represent
accurately the accretion rate in the super-Eddington regime. On the other hand,
super-Eddington accreting quasars appear to show large hard X-ray (rest-frame >
2 keV) power-law photon indices, and they also exhibit distinct optical
spectral features including weak [O III] $\lambda 5007$ emission and strong Fe
II emission. We test steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington
accreting quasars by obtaining Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope near-infrared
spectra for a pilot sample of nine $\Gamma=2.0-2.6$ quasars at
$z\approx1.4-2.5$. We derive H$\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole
masses (median value $\rm 4.3 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios
(median value 0.6). The Eddington ratio distribution is consistent with that of
the comparison sample, which is a flux-limited sample of quasars at
$z\approx1.5-3.5$ with near-infrared spectroscopy. But our super-Eddington
candidates do show statistically weaker [O III] emission ($P_{\rm
null}=0.0075$) and marginally stronger Fe II emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.06$). We
also find one candidate with broad (width of 1960 km/s) and blueshifted (690
km/s) [O III] $\lambda 4959$ and [O III] $\lambda 5007$ lines, which probably
originate from a strong [O III] outflow driven by super-Eddington accretion.
Overall, the steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting
quasars appears promising. But a larger sample is needed to assess further the
reliability of the selection.

### [14] [Diverse Emission Patterns from Precessing Super-Eddington Disks Formed in Tidal Disruption Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24071)
*Jin-Hong Chen,Lixin Dai,Kan Cheuk Kwan,Tom Man Kwan,Zijian Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the precession of misaligned super-Eddington disks in tidal disruption events (TDEs) causes distinctive X-ray and optical variability patterns. By simulating radiative transfer effects, they identify four observational types (smooth, dimmer, blinker, siren) linked to disk precession and orientation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the diverse observational signatures of TDEs, particularly the multi-wavelength variability, by considering the impact of disk precession due to SMBH spin and angular momentum misalignment.

Method: The authors performed radiative transfer calculations on existing super-Eddington disk simulations. They modeled disk precession caused by the Lense-Thirring effect and analyzed how varying viewing angles and disk tilt angles produce different emission variability types.

Result: Four variability types were identified based on observer orientation and disk tilt: smooth (no fluctuations), dimmer (modulated brightness), blinker (alternating X-ray/optical dominance), and siren (two-phase alternation with dual X-ray peaks per cycle). All show inverse X-ray-optical correlations.

Conclusion: The study proposes a unified framework for interpreting TDE variability via disk precession, offering an alternative explanation for cases like J045650.3-203750 previously attributed to repeated TDEs. This mechanism could resolve discrepancies between observed variability and single-tide disruption models.

Abstract: A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star passes within the tidal
radius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). In TDEs it is expected that the
orbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the
SMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk
precessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this
paper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such
TDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous
super-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the
disk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray
radiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer
and the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1)
The smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The
dimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to
moderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions
take turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the
X-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other
twice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one
cycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray
and optical emissions. Our model provides a unified physical framework for
interpreting TDE multi-wavelength variability through disk precession dynamics
and gives an alternative interpretation to the interesting case of
J045650.3-203750 which was suggested to be a repeated partial TDE previously.

Abstract: X-ray bursts from the magnetar can lead to the formation of fireballs trapped
by the magnetic field and co-rotating with the star. The fireball emission
could occasionally be eclipsed by the magnetar, especially when the burst
duration is comparable to the magnetar's spin period. In this work, we discover
a peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the
long bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Based on these bursts, we
identified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting
their light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the
magnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\circ \pm 10^\circ$.
The distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than five
times the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the
magnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. We also find this
configuration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron
resonance scattering feature in their spectra. Our results suggest that some
intermediate X-ray bursts of SGR 1935+2154 may originate from magnetic
reconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present the decadal brightening of non-thermal emission flux in the
northeastern filament of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A),
which highlights dynamic processes in the forward shock. This filament,
characterized by the highest particle acceleration rate among Cas A's outer
shells, offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate underlying
astrophysical mechanisms. Since 2000, the non-thermal flux has increased by
several tens of percent before plateauing, while the spectral shape has
remained largely unchanged. Over the past two decades, the filament's
morphology has evolved significantly, splitting into two distinct sections.
Detailed analysis reveals contrasting behaviors: one section shows a flux
increase followed by saturation, while the other maintains a steady flux. These
differences likely arise from nonlinear effects, including magnetohydrodynamic
interactions influenced by magnetic field orientation, interactions with
surrounding material, and complex fluid dynamics associated with young
supernova remnants. The localized evolution of this filament, captured with
high spatial resolution, provides critical insights into the temporal dynamics
of non-thermal particles and the generation of cosmic rays from asymmetric
supernova explosions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neutron stars provide unique laboratories for probing physics of dense
nuclear matter under extreme conditions. Their thermal and luminosity evolution
reflects key internal properties such as the equation of state (EoS), nucleon
superfluidity and superconductivity, envelope composition, and magnetic field,
and so on. Recent observations [\textit{e.g.}, V. Abramkin \textit{et al.,} ApJ
\textbf{924}, 128 (2022)] have revealed unexpectedly warm old neutron stars,
which cannot be explained by standard neutrino-photon cooling models. The
failure of the standard cooling models implies the presence of additional
internal heating mechanism. Building on the previous study [M. Fujiwara
\textit{et al}., JCAP \textbf{03}, 051 (2024)], which proposed vortex creep
heating (VCH) from the frictional motion of superfluid vortices as a viable
mechanism, we extend the cooling framework to include both VCH and direct Urca
(DUrca) processes. These are implemented in our code to explore their combined
impact, particularly for massive neutron stars where DUrca operates. By varying
rotational parameters ($P$, $\dot{P}$, $P_0$), EoS models (APR, BSk24), pairing
gaps, and envelope compositions, we examine how heating-cooling interplay
shapes the temperature evolution. Our results show that VCH can substantially
mitigate the rapid cooling driven by DUrca, offering new evolutionary pathways
for massive neutron stars.

### [18] [XRISM High-resolution Spectroscopy of SS 433: Evidence of Decreasing Line-of-Sight Velocity Dispersion along the Jet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24341)
*Megumi Shidatsu,Shogo Kobayashi,Yusuke Sakai,Toshihiro Takagi,Yuta Okada,Shinya Yamada,Yoshihiro Ueda,Hideki Uchiyama,Robert Petre*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses XRISM/Resolve observations of SS 433 to analyze jet structure via X-ray spectroscopy, revealing velocity dispersion variations in Fe/Ni and Si/S lines during and outside eclipse phases, suggesting progressive jet collimation or reduced turbulence with outward motion, and asymmetry between jet components due to accretion disk occultation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamics and collimation of jets in SS 433 using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, specifically analyzing how velocity dispersion changes across different phases and emission lines.

Method: Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM/Resolve during a 5-day observation spanning eclipse and post-eclipse phases. Doppler-shifted Fe, Ni, Si, and S Kα lines were analyzed for line width variations.

Result: Fe/Ni lines showed increased velocity dispersion (from ~1020 to 1740 km/s) outside eclipse, broader than Si/S lines. Time-averaged spectra confirmed higher dispersion at higher energies (1900 vs 1300 km/s). Receding jet had lower dispersion (1400 vs 1740 km/s) due to accretion disk occultation.

Conclusion: Jet plasma velocity dispersion decreases outward, suggesting collimation or reduced turbulence. Asymmetry between jet components indicates differential obscuration by the accretion disk, supporting models like Namiki et al. (2003).

Abstract: We report on the jet structure in SS 433 based on X-ray high resolution
spectroscopy with the XRISM/Resolve. The source was observed over 5 days
covering both inside and outside an eclipse of the compact object by the
companion star. Doppler-shifted, ionized Fe and Ni K emission lines were
resolved, as well as lower-energy lines including Si and S K lines.
Time-resolved spectral analysis showed that Fe and Ni K line widths were $1020
\pm 40$ km s$^{-1}$ (corresponding the 1$\sigma$ width) in the eclipse phase,
gradually increased during the egress, and reached $1740 \pm 30$ km s$^{-1}$
outside the eclipse. A time-averaged spectrum outside the eclipse confirmed
that the Fe and Ni K lines in 5.5-9 keV are significantly broader than the Si
and S K$\alpha$ emission lines in 2--4 keV. Specifically, the width in 5.5-9
keV was measured to be $1900 \pm 80$ km s$^{-1}$, whereas the width in 2-4 keV
is $1300^{+300}_{-400}$ km s$^{-1}$ for the approaching (blueshifted) jet
component. These results indicate that radial velocity dispersion of the jet
plasma in SS 433 decreases as it moves outward. We interpret this variation as
progressive jet collimation along its axis, as suggested by Namiki et al.
(2003), or a decrease in turbulence in the jet plasma flow within the X-ray
emitting region. We also detected a clear difference in velocity dispersion
between the approaching and receding (redshifted) jet components in the 5.5-9
keV band outside eclipse. The receding jet exhibited a smaller velocity
dispersion ($1400 \pm 200$ km s$^{-1}$) than the approaching jet. Since the
observation was conducted when the approaching jet was tilted toward the
observer, this may suggest that the receding jet was more extensively occulted
by the accretion disk.

### [19] [Multi-messenger constraints on transient accelerators of ultra-high energy cosmic rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24516)
*Antonio Condorelli,Jonathan Biteau,Olivier Deligny,Remi Adam*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) by evaluating two source distribution models—star-formation-rate and stellar-mass density. Using Auger Observatory data, they analyze UHECR spectra, mass composition, and propagation effects from cosmic structures like galaxy clusters. Their findings favor long gamma-ray bursts as prime candidates and predict detectable neutrino/photon signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the long-standing mystery of UHECR origins, the study addresses gaps in understanding source distributions, acceleration mechanisms, and propagation effects. It seeks to connect astrophysical source models with observational data.

Method: Joint spectral and composition fits of Auger data to constrain UHECR energetics and abundances. Sky maps were generated using a galaxy catalog (400,000+ galaxies within 350 Mpc) to model source distributions. Propagation effects from galaxy clusters and magnetic fields were simulated. Secondary neutrino/photon fluxes were calculated and compared to experiment limits.

Result: Galaxy clusters significantly impede heavy nuclei propagation. Long gamma-ray bursts emerge as top candidates due to matching constraints. Predicted neutrino/photon signals are marginally within reach of current detectors, suggesting future observatories could confirm findings.

Conclusion: The combination of source distribution models, cosmic structure effects, and multi-messenger signals strongly implicates long GRBs as primary UHECR producers. Future observations of neutrinos and anisotropies in arrival directions are critical to confirm these conclusions.

Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains an open
questions in astrophysics. We explore two primary scenarios for the
distribution of UHECR sources, assuming that their production rate follows
either the cosmic star-formation-rate or stellar-mass density. By jointly
fitting the UHECR energy spectrum and mass composition measured by the Pierre
Auger Observatory above the ankle (10^{18.7} eV), we derive constraints on the
acceleration mechanisms, source energetics, and elemental abundances at escape.
Using these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40 EeV based on a catalog
of over 400,000 galaxies out to 350 Mpc, providing a near-infrared flux-limited
sample that maps the two stellar-activity tracers across the full sky. A
crucial factor in understanding UHECR propagation is the influence of
large-scale cosmic structures, particularly galaxy clusters, the largest
gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, which are filled with magnetized
diffuse plasma. Intermittent sources hosted in galaxies within such structures,
coupled with cosmic magnetic fields, shape the observed UHECR arrival
directions and provide insights into the burst rate of the sources. We show
that these environments can significantly impact UHECR transport, making them
particularly opaque to heavy nuclei. Additionally, we compute the expected
secondary neutrino and photon fluxes from UHECR interactions in these
environments and compare them with current experimental limits, constraining
the maximum energy that particles can achieve. Finally, we assess the
compatibility of these constraints with astrophysical candidates, identifying
long gamma-ray bursts as the most promising sources.

Abstract: Late-time light curve plateaus in tidal disruption events (TDEs) are often
approximated as flat and time-independent. This simplification is motivated by
theoretical modeling of spreading late time TDE disks, which often predicts
slow light curve evolution. However, if time evolution can be detected,
late-time light curves will yield more information than has been previously
accessible. In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the
flat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the
maximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike
information criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors
evolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no
statistically significant evidence for any plateau. Next, we refit the TDEs
that exhibit statistically significant plateaus using a magnetically elevated
$\alpha$-disk model, motivated by the lack of clear thermal instability in late
time TDE light curves. From these model-dependent fits, we obtain estimates for
the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, the mass of the disrupted star, and
the $\alpha$ parameter itself. Fitted $\alpha$ values range from $10^{-3}$ to
0.4 (the mean fitted $\alpha=10^{-1.8}$, with scatter of 0.6 dex), broadly
consistent with results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we
estimate the timescales of disk precession in magnetically elevated TDE models.
Theoretically, we find that disk precession times may be orders of magnitude
shorter than in unmagnetized Shakura-Sunyaev disks, and grow in time as $T_{\rm
prec}\propto t^{35/36}$; empirically, by using fitted $\alpha$ parameters, we
estimate that late time disks may experience $\sim$few-10 precession cycles.

Abstract: We stack 3.75 Megaseconds of early XRISM Resolve observations of ten galaxy
clusters to search for unidentified spectral lines in the $E=$ 2.5-15 keV band
(rest frame), including the $E=3.5$ keV line reported in earlier, low spectral
resolution studies of cluster samples. Such an emission line may originate from
the decay of the sterile neutrino, a warm dark matter (DM) candidate. No
unidentified lines are detected in our stacked cluster spectrum, with the
$3\sigma$ upper limit on the $m_{\rm s}\sim$ 7.1 keV DM particle decay rate
(which corresponds to a $E=3.55$ keV emission line) of $\Gamma \sim 1.0 \times
10^{-27}$ s$^{-1}$. This upper limit is 3-4 times lower than the one derived by
Hitomi Collaboration et al. (2017) from the Perseus observation, but still 5
times higher than the XMM-Newton detection reported by Bulbul et al. (2014) in
the stacked cluster sample. XRISM Resolve, with its high spectral resolution
but a small field of view, may reach the sensitivity needed to test the
XMM-Newton cluster sample detection by combining several years worth of future
cluster observations.

Abstract: Over the past LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing runs, it has become
increasingly clear that identifying the next electromagnetic counterparts to
gravitational-wave (GW) neutron star mergers will likely be more challenging
compared to the case of GW170817. The rarity of these GW events, and their
electromagnetic counterparts, motivates rapid searches of any candidate binary
neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the LVK. We present our extensive
photometric and spectroscopic campaign of the candidate counterpart AT2025ulz
to the low-significance GW event S250818k, which had a ${\sim} 29\%$
probability of being a BNS merger. We demonstrate that during the first five
days, the luminosity and color evolution of AT2025ulz are consistent with both
kilonova and shock cooling models, although a Bayesian model comparison shows
preference for the shock cooling model, underscoring the ambiguity inherent to
early data obtained over only a few days. Continued monitoring beyond this
window reveals a rise and color evolution incompatible with kilonova models and
instead consistent with a supernova. This event emphasizes the difficulty in
identifying the electromagnetic counterparts to BNS mergers and the significant
allotment of observing time necessary to robustly differentiate kilonovae from
impostors.

Abstract: We study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints on heavy QCD axions. BBN
offers a powerful probe of new physics that modifies the neutron-to-proton
ratio during the process, thanks to the precisely measured primordial Helium-4
abundance. A heavy QCD axion provides an attractive target for this probe,
because not only is it a well-motivated hypothetical particle by the strong CP
problem, but also it dominantly decays to hadrons if kinematically allowed. A
range of its lifetime is thus excluded where the hadronic decays would
significantly alter the neutron-to-proton ratio. We compute axion-induced
modification of the neutron-to-proton ratio, and obtain robust upper bounds on
the axion lifetimes, as low as 0.017 s for the axion mass higher than 300 MeV.
Remarkably, this is stronger than projected future CMB bounds via $N_{\rm
eff}$. Our bounds are largely insensitive to uncertainties in hadronic cross
sections and the axion's branching fractions into various hadrons, as well as
to the precise value of the initial axion abundance. We also incorporate, for
the first time, several key improvements, such as scattering processes by
energetic $K_L$ and secondary hadrons, that can also be important for studying
general hadronic injections during BBN, not limited to those from axion decays.

Motivation: Investigate the potential for detecting displaced vertices from long-lived dark mesons in accelerator experiments to uncover details about the structure of strongly-interacting dark sectors.

Method: Evaluate current constraints from NA62 and BaBar experiments, and project sensitivity for future experiments (SHiP, Belle II). Analyze parameter regions where SHiP could observe multiple displaced vertices per event.

Result: Identifies a significant parameter space where SHiP may detect several displaced vertices per event, offering insights into the dark sector's structure. Current constraints from NA62 and BaBar are considered, and future sensitivity projections are outlined.

Conclusion: SHiP and Belle II have promising sensitivity to detect displaced vertices from dark mesons, providing a pathway to study dark sector dynamics through multiple-vertex signatures in a single event.

Abstract: In models of strongly-interacting dark sectors, the production of dark quarks
at accelerators can give rise to dark showers with multiple dark mesons in the
final state. If some of these dark mesons are sufficiently light and
long-lived, they can be detected with searches for displaced vertices at
beam-dump experiments and electron-positron colliders. In this work we focus on
the case that dark quark production proceeds via effective operators, while the
dark sector analogue of the $\rho^0$ meson can decay via kinetic mixing. We
evaluate current constraints from NA62 and BaBar as well as sensitivity
projections for SHiP and Belle II. We find that there exists a sizable
parameter region where SHiP may detect several displaced vertices in a single
event and thus obtain valuable information about the structure of the dark
sector.

### [25] [Anarchic neutrinos from flavor deconstruction: phenomenology of the lepton sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23703)
*Gino Isidori,Paride Paradisi,Andrea Sainaghi,Nudzeim Selimovic*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the neutrino sector using flavor deconstruction and inverse seesaw, linking charged-fermion hierarchies to light neutrino mixing. It examines HNL phenomenology and LFV processes, finding current bounds restrict the right-handed neutrino scale to a few TeV, with future experiments probing up to 10 TeV. Preferred deconstruction models involve SU(2)_L × U(1)_{B-L} or SU(2)_L × U(1)_R × U(1)_{B-L}.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the connection between charged fermion mass hierarchies and anarchic neutrino mixing, and to explore phenomenological implications of heavy neutral leptons and LFV processes within the inverse seesaw framework.

Method: Flavor deconstruction framework with inverse-seesaw mechanism. Parameter space analysis consistent with neutrino oscillation data. Study of HNL and LFV processes, considering constraints from direct HNL searches and LFV decay experiments.

Result: Right-handed neutrino scale constrained to ~few TeV by current data. Future mu → e experiments can probe scales up to ~10 TeV. Models deconstructing SU(2)_L×U(1)_{B-L} or SU(2)_L×U(1)_R×U(1)_{B-L} achieve the lowest deconstruction scales.

Conclusion: Flavor deconstruction in inverse-seesaw provides a natural link between fermion mass hierarchies and neutrino mixing. Next-gen experiments will critically test these models, with specific gauge group realizations offering energetically favorable scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate the neutrino sector in the framework of flavor deconstruction
with an inverse-seesaw realization. This setup naturally links the hierarchical
charged-fermion masses to the anarchic pattern of light-neutrino mixing. We
determine the viable parameter space consistent with oscillation data and study
the phenomenology of heavy neutral leptons (HNL) and lepton-flavor-violating
(LFV) processes. Current bounds from direct HNL searches and LFV decays
constrain the right-handed neutrino scale to a few TeV, while future $\mu \to
e$ experiments will probe most of the region with $\Lambda \lesssim
10~\text{TeV}$. Among possible realizations, models deconstructing
$\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{B-L}$ or
$\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{R} \times
\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{B-L}$ are those allowing the lowest deconstruction scale.

### [26] [Delayed Charged Lepton Yukawa Equilibration and Thermal Leptogenesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23712)
*Rishav Roshan,Sudipta Show*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper argues that the heaviest decoupled right-handed neutrino, often neglected in minimal type-I seesaw models, can significantly impact cosmology by altering charged lepton Yukawa equilibration temperatures. This requires revisiting lepton flavor effects in thermal leptogenesis and flavor regime boundaries, with implications for neutrino oscillation and gravitational wave experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most studies ignore the heaviest right-handed neutrino's role in neutrino masses and leptogenesis, but its long lifetime could have major cosmological effects that current models miss.

Method: Analyze the cosmological effects of a long-lived heaviest right-handed neutrino, focusing on its impact on Yukawa equilibration temperatures and flavor dynamics in thermal leptogenesis.

Result: The heaviest neutrino's late decay prolongs Yukawa equilibration, shifting flavor regime boundaries. New experimental probes via neutrino oscillations and gravitational waves are proposed.

Conclusion: Neglecting the heaviest right-handed neutrino invalidates standard leptogenesis predictions. Future experiments must account for its effects to accurately interpret neutrino and cosmological data.

Abstract: While most studies of the minimal type-I seesaw neglect the heaviest
decoupled right-handed neutrino, assuming negligible contributions to neutrino
masses and leptogenesis, we demonstrate that its cosmological role can be
significant. When long-lived, this particle substantially modifies the charged
lepton Yukawa equilibration temperature in the early universe, necessitating
reassessment of lepton flavor effects in thermal leptogenesis and potentially
shifting flavor regime boundaries. We identify experimental probes through
neutrino oscillation measurements and gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: The growing evidence for nano-hertz gravitational waves, from NANOGrav and
other observations, may be pointing to a cosmological first-order phase
transition at temperatures of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)\;\mathrm{MeV}$. Such an
interpretation requires dynamics beyond the Standard Model in this energy
range. If so, it may well be the case that core-collapse supernova explosions
would recreate the first-order phase transition leaving a unique imprint on the
spectrum of neutrinos emitted in the initial few seconds. This scenario is also
suggestive of a low-mass seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino masses. We
outline the prospects for future observations of Galactic supernovae to uncover
the signals of this scenario, which could get further confirmation with
additional pulsar timing array data establishing the primordial origin of the
observed nano-hertz gravitational waves.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The decay $A\to ZH$ is a characteristic signal of two-Higgs-doublet models
(2HDMs), where $A$ and $H$ lie primarily within the same $SU(2)_L$ multiplet,
leading to a coupling of order $g_2$ to the $Z$ boson. The subsequent decay $H
\to tt^{(*)}$ is particularly promising, as it gives rise to distinct final
states involving multiple leptons and $b$-jets. The required splitting between
$m_A$ and $m_H$ can naturally occur near the electroweak scale while being
consistent with perturbative unitarity. Whereas dedicated ATLAS and CMS
searches focused on the region with both top-quarks on-shell, we cover lower
masses where one top quark is off-shell by recasting Standard Model $t\bar{t}Z$
measurements of ATLAS and CMS. The obtained limits on $\sigma(A\to ZH)\times
{\rm Br} (H\to t\bar t)$ are between $0.12$ pb and $0.62$ pb. When interpreted
within the type-I 2HDM, a sizable part of the so far unconstrained low-mass
region is excluded. Interestingly, we observe these stringent limits despite a
preference (up to $2.5\sigma$) for a non-zero new physics signal, most
pronounced around for $m_A \approx 450-460$ GeV and $m_H\approx 290$ GeV, with
a best-fit value of $\sigma(A \to ZH) \times {\rm Br}(H \to t\bar t) \approx
0.3$ pb. This cross section can be accommodated within a top-philic 2HDM for a
top-Yukawa coupling of the second Higgs doublet of $\mu_t \gtrsim 0.16$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The QCD axion can successfully solve the strong CP problem under the
condition that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is respected to extremely high
standard. We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality
axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the
cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to
unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can
always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge
strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed
timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into
gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space
allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.

*Maxim Dvornikov*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates neutrino oscillations in external fields using quantum field theory (QFT), focusing on Dirac neutrinos. Challenges in calculating propagators for Dirac neutrinos in matter are addressed via regularization. The study derives interaction probabilities with matter and magnetic fields, revealing additional QFT contributions beyond standard quantum mechanical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend QFT-based neutrino oscillation studies to Dirac fermions, addressing unresolved issues in propagator calculations for matter interactions and exploring effects of magnetic fields through transition magnetic moments.

Method: Uses QFT formalism with dressed propagators for Dirac neutrinos in external fields (matter and magnetic). Regularizes the neutrino-matter interaction potential to overcome calculation difficulties. Derives matrix elements and probabilities for both field types.

Result: Derived probabilities show small QFT contributions beyond quantum mechanics predictions for spin-flavor precession. Highlights unique behaviors of Dirac neutrinos, such as observable right-handed states, differing from Majorana particles.

Conclusion: QFT approach successfully applied to Dirac neutrinos in external fields, resolving prior challenges. Results emphasize distinctions between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos, suggesting QFT's importance for precise oscillation predictions and distinguishing neutrino properties.

Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in external fields using the approach based on
the quantum field theory (QFT). Neutrinos are virtual particles in this
formalism. Neutrino mass eigenstates are supposed to be Dirac fermions. We
consider two cases of external fields: the neutrino electroweak interaction
with background matter and the interaction with an external magnetic field
owing to the presence of the transition magnetic moment. The formalism used
involves the dressed propagators of mass eigenstates in external fields. In the
matter case, finding of these propagators for Dirac neutrinos has certain
difficulties compared to the Majorana particles considered previously. These
difficulties are overcome by regularizing the effective potential of the
neutrino interaction with matter. The QFT formalism application to the
spin-flavor precession also encounters certain peculiarities in the Dirac case
compared to the Majorana one. They are related to the observability of right
polarized Dirac neutrinos. We derive the matrix elements and the probabilities
for Dirac neutrinos interacting with both types of external fields. In case of
the spin-flavor precession, we obtain the small QFT contribution to the
probabilities in addition to the prediction of the quantum mechanical approach.

### [31] [WIMP Shadows: Phenomenology of Secluded Dark Matter in Three Minimal BSM Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23771)
*Mattia Di Mauro,Yanhan Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores secluded dark matter models where the relic abundance is maintained via annihilations into hidden-sector mediators, leading to suppressed signals in direct detection experiments. Three models are analyzed, showing that for very small portal couplings (<1e-3), the observed relic density is achievable with scattering rates below current and projected experimental limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate models that avoid strong constraints from direct/indirect detection while maintaining thermal relic abundance, focusing on the 'secluded' mechanism where DM annihilates into hidden mediators. This contrasts with canonical WIMPs which are now tightly constrained.

Method: Analyzes three minimal secluded DM models (A' vector, scalar S with trilinear K, Dirac fermion with Higgs-mixed H_p). Derive annihilation/scattering rates, solve Boltzmann equations for both WIMP and secluded scenarios, calculate thermal equilibrium conditions for mediators, and evaluate constraints/expperimental reach.

Result: For epsilon << 1e-3, relic density is controlled by DM→mediator annihilation. Present-day scattering cross-sections are too small for detection (even future neutrino floor). Indirect detection constraints are weak due to p-wave suppression and small epsilon. Collider searches remain viable for certain parameter regions.

Conclusion: Secluded DM models provide a viable alternative to canonical WIMPs, surviving current constraints and offering testable predictions at upcoming colliders despite extremely small couplings to Standard Model particles.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of secluded dark matter (DM) $\chi$, where
the relic abundance is set by annihilations into lighter dark mediators $\phi$
that couple only feebly to the Standard Model (SM). In contrast to canonical
WIMPs, which are now strongly constrained by direct and indirect searches,
secluded models still achieve the observed relic abundance via thermal
freeze-out into hidden-sector mediators, while predicting highly suppressed
present-day signals. We analyze three minimal models: (i) a $U(1)_X$ gauge
boson ($A'$) with kinetic mixing; (ii) a scalar DM candidate $S$ with a scalar
mediator $K$ that has a trilinear vertex; and (iii) a Dirac fermion $\chi$
whose mass arises from a Higgs-mixed singlet $H_p$. For each model we derive
annihilation and scattering rates in both WIMP-like and secluded regimes, and
solve the Boltzmann equations: a single-species equation for the WIMP case and
a coupled $\chi$-$\phi$ system for the secluded case to account for possible
early departure of the mediator from thermal equilibrium with the SM bath. In
this regard, we provide explicit lower limits on the portal coupling $\epsilon$
required to keep the mediator in thermal equilibrium with the SM bath and to
ensure mediator decay before BBN. We show that for portal couplings $\epsilon
\ll 10^{-3}$ the relic density is dominantly controlled by DM annihilation into
mediator pairs, while spin-independent scattering lies well below current
limits and remains viable even for future experiments approaching the
irreducible neutrino background floor. Indirect constraints are typically weak
due to $p$-wave suppression, off-resonance $s$-channels, and cascade spectra
controlled by $\epsilon^2$. Finally, we highlight the most promising collider
tests, which remain sensitive despite tiny portal couplings.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines quantum information measures like entanglement and magic in electron-proton scattering at the EIC, showing that transversely polarized beams produce entangled/non-stabilizer states, unlike unpolarized or longitudinally polarized beams. This opens new avenues for quantum studies in high-energy physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore non-classical quantum states in high-energy physics experiments, specifically understanding how beam polarization affects entanglement and magic in scattering processes.

Method: Analysis of entanglement and magic measures in electron-proton scattering using QED framework, considering both elastic and deep inelastic regimes. Investigated the role of transversity parton distribution functions in quantum correlations.

Result: Transversely polarized beams generate entangled/non-stabilizer states, while unpolarized/longitudinally polarized beams do not. Quantum correlations in DIS are linked to transversity PDFs, offering a new perspective on QCD spin dynamics.

Conclusion: The EIC is a viable platform for creating entangled/non-stabilizer states in high-energy physics, with potential for future colliders to explore these phenomena further in new kinematic regions.

Abstract: We investigate quantum-information-theoretic observables in electron-proton
scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Our analysis focuses on
entanglement and magic, two complementary indicators of non-classicality in
quantum states. We show that while unpolarized and longitudinally polarized
beams yield unentangled separable outcomes, transverse beam polarization
enables the generation of entangled and non-stabilizer states. This result
holds for both elastic and deep inelastic electron-proton scattering in QED. In
the deep inelastic regime, the degree of quantum correlation is governed by the
transversity parton distribution functions, providing a novel perspective on
spin dynamics within QCD. These results establish the EIC as a promising
environment for generating entangled and non-stabilizer states in high-energy
physics, and they highlight opportunities for future lepton-hadron colliders to
extend such studies into new kinematic domains.

Abstract: Ultralight scalar dark matter may couple to the Standard Model through
dimension-five operators that contain the field-strength tensors of the gauge
interactions. Recent progress in nuclear clocks is projected to increase the
sensitivity to such couplings by several orders of magnitude. Future
experimental constraints may even have Planck-scale sensitivity, calling for a
study of such couplings in a framework that includes quantum gravity. We take a
first step towards providing the theoretical constraints on such couplings that
arise in asymptotically safe gravity. We find evidence that such couplings
vanish in asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a
perturbative quantum-gravity regime that describes quantum gravity as an
effective field theory.

expressing multi-point Passarino-Veltman functions in a two-point basis and
using shifted space-time dimensions with recurrence relations, we minimize the

Abstract: We demonstrate the non-spreading behavior of Airy wave packets utilizing the
Feynman path integral formulation of a linear potential, the Airy functions'
zeros correspondence to heavy-meson mass spectroscopy, and their implications
to the eigenstates of ultra-cold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field. We
derive the linear kernel, and utilize the Feynman path integral time evolution
to show that Airy function wave packets are non-dispersive in free space. We
then model the confining contribution to 1S - 2S heavy meson mass gaps as a
1+1D absolute linear potential and look at the correspondence of the Airy
function zeros. In doing so, we predicted the confining contribution to the
mass gap of heavy mesons with a good accuracy when compared to calculations
performed in the light front. Furthermore, we used these Airy function
solutions to model the quantum states of a neutron under Earth's gravity. We
show that the measured heights of a neutron can be modeled by the zeros of the
Airy function, and compare to experimental data and predictions utilizing the
WKB approximation.

TL;DR: The study shows that as a quark-antiquark pair separates to the point of string breaking, the confining flux tube transitions into a thermal state reminiscent of entanglement with a heat bath, indicating a link between confinement, entanglement, and thermalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how confinement properties manifest through quantum statistical measures, particularly the transition to thermality near string-breaking in the Schwinger model.

Method: Analyzing the reduced density matrix of the string region between static fermion-antifermion pairs, comparing it to thermal density matrices as separation approaches the critical distance.

Result: A narrow peak in thermal-state overlap near string breaking, rapid transition in entanglement spectrum from single-state dominance to entangled virtual pair states, indicating emergent thermality.

Conclusion: String breaking corresponds to a thermalization transition in the flux tube, showing confinement arises from entanglement-driven thermality without external heat bath.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string
connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By
analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the
fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation
approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic
density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced,
narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior
reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state
as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external
heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the
subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the
rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking
distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state
describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state
containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a
quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality,
and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization
transition within the flux tube.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ongoing debate about the shape of the pion valence quark distribution function, particularly its behavior at large light-front momentum fractions.

Method: Utilizes QCD effective charges and generalized parton distributions (GPDs), leveraging the known monopole-like approximation of the pion's electromagnetic form factor to derive the asymptotic form of the valence quark distribution.

Result: The pion valence quark distribution function is convex at large x and follows a power law that aligns with QCD expectations, resolving previous discrepancies.

Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates that the pion valence quark DF's large-x behavior is inherently consistent with QCD principles when considering the monopole form factor, providing a clear theoretical framework for future studies.

Abstract: The profile of the pion valence quark distribution function (DF) remains
controversial. Working from the concepts of QCD effective charges and
generalised parton distributions, we show that since the pion elastic
electromagnetic form factor is well approximated by a monopole, then, at large
light-front momentum fraction, the pion valence quark DF is a convex function
described by a large-$x$ power law that is practically consistent with
expectations based on quantum chromodynamics.

Motivation: To understand the potential origin of PBHs through electroweak phase transitions and connect early Universe physics with observable signatures in gravitational waves and particle colliders.

Method: Quantitative analysis of PBH formation in the complex singlet extension of the Standard Model, considering phase transition parameters, gravitational wave production, and Higgs coupling modifications.

Result: Identified parameter regions compatible with microlensing constraints, predicting detectable gravitational waves for future space-based detectors and measurable Higgs triple coupling deviations at lepton colliders.

Conclusion: A multimessenger approach combining PBHs, gravitational waves, and collider data offers a robust framework to test the dynamics of early Universe electroweak phase transitions.

Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) induced by a
first-order electroweak phase transition in a realistic renormalizable
framework, the complex singlet extension of the Standard Model. We perform a
quantitative analysis of the PBH abundance and identify parameter regions
consistent with current microlensing constraints. Furthermore, we show that the
same parameter space predicts observable stochastic gravitational waves within
the sensitivities of future space-based detectors, as well as a sizable
deviation in the Higgs triple coupling that can be probed at future lepton
colliders. Our results highlight a comprehensive multimessenger framework in
which PBH, gravitational wave, and collider observations can jointly test the
dynamics of a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition in the early

Motivation: To improve the discovery potential of past, current, and future collider experiments by building on the OmniLearn foundation model with expanded capabilities.

Method: Three key elements: 1) model architecture and training updates, 2) training on over one billion jets, 3) providing well-documented software for datasets and models.

Result: OmniLearned outperforms prior methods in three tasks: top-quark jet tagging on Delphes benchmarks, b-tagging on ATLAS simulations, and anomaly detection in CMS data, setting new state-of-the-art performance levels.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates enhanced capabilities across diverse collider tasks, reaffirming its role in advancing high-energy physics research and discovery potential.

Abstract: Foundation models use large datasets to build an effective representation of

developed the OmniLearn foundation model for jet physics, using unique
properties of particle physics, and showed that it could significantly advance
discovery potential across collider experiments. This paper introduces a major
upgrade, resulting in the OmniLearned framework. This framework has three new
elements: (1) updates to the model architecture and training, (2) using over
one billion jets used for training, and (3) providing well-documented software
for accessing all datasets and models. We demonstrate OmniLearned with three
representative tasks: top-quark jet tagging with the community Delphes-based
benchmark dataset, b-tagging with ATLAS full simulation, and anomaly detection
with CMS experimental data. In each case, OmniLearned is the state of the art,
further expanding the discovery potential of past, current, and future collider

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the detection of long-lived axion-like particles (ALPs) at the HL-LHC, focusing on two decay channels, π⁺π⁻γEₜ and ℓ⁺ℓ⁻γEₜ. It demonstrates that the HL-LHC can significantly extend the parameter space probed by past experiments like LHCb, with prospective sensitivity ranges for ALP mass (4-10 GeV) and coupling strength (gₐ̃WW between ~10⁻³ to ~10⁻¹ TeV⁻¹).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPs are prominent beyond SM candidates whose long-lived nature in the photophobic scenario enables detection via displaced vertices at HL-LHC, complementing previous prompt decay searches.

Method: Analyzing the process pp→γa followed by ALP decay into displaced charged leptons. Signal selections for π⁺π⁻γEₜ and ℓ⁺ℓ⁻γEₜ channels were evaluated considering HL-LHC conditions (14 TeV, 3 ab⁻¹).

Result: For π⁺π⁻γEₜ, sensitivities cover gₐWW [8.72e-3-6.42e-2] TeV⁻¹ for mₐ 4-10 GeV. The ℓ⁺ℓ⁻γEₜ channel extends reach to gₐWW [4.17e-3-2.00e-1] TeV⁻¹ same mass range, outperforming prior studies.

Conclusion: HL-LHC offers substantial capability to probe long-lived ALPs through displaced signatures, surpassing previous LEP/LHC experiments and requiring continued exploration of these channels.

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated extensions of the standard

\gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T$ and $\ell^+ \ell^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T$. For
the $\pi^+ \pi^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T$ signal, we find that the
prospective sensitivities of the HL-LHC can reach $g_{aWW}\in [8.72 \times
10^{-3}, 6.42 \times 10^{-2}]$ TeV$^{-1}$ for the ALP mass $m_a \in [4, 10]$
GeV. While for the $\ell^+ \ell^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T$ signal, the HL-LHC
can probe a broader parameter space, with the sensitivities covering $m_a \in
[4, 10]$ GeV and $g_{aWW} \in [4.17 \times 10^{-3}, 2.00 \times 10^{-1}]$
TeV$^{-1}$. These long-lived searches complement some previous prompt decay
studies from LEP and LHC experiments, extending the parameter space explored by
the LHCb collaboration. Our results show that the HL-LHC has significant
potential to probe long-lived ALPs via their displaced vertex signatures.

Abstract: We study cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) in Higgs
inflation, wherein the inflaton is a scalar field with quartic self-coupling
$\lambda$ and a nonminimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, and which may, but need
not be, the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). We find an explosive
particle production peaked on a characteristic comoving wavenumber $k\sim
\xi^{2/3} a H$ with a peak occupation number that scales with $\xi$. This new
peak in production can easily dominate over the conventional (minimally coupled
inflation) CGPP even for modest values of $\xi$. The results apply for a wide
range of $\xi$, e.g., as low as $\xi=10$, which can be realized for the
Standard Model Higgs given suitable RG flow of the quartic coupling. We discuss
implications for late time relics such as dark matter.

*X. G. Wang,A. W. Thomas*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dark sector model with Dirac fermion dark matter coupled to a dark photon, leading to suppressed direct detection signals and a larger parameter space consistent with current constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a viable dark matter model that avoids existing experimental constraints and explains the observed thermal relic density while providing a detectable portal to the Standard Model.

Method: The model uses a Dirac fermion dark matter particle interacting via a dark photon, analyzing its non-relativistic limit to derive the dominant effective operator (O_8) for direct detection and studying its implications on detection rates and parameter space.

Result: The model shows that the direct detection event rate is suppressed by dark matter velocity or momentum transfer, allowing for a broader parameter space compatible with thermal relic density, direct detection limits, and collider results.

Conclusion: This model offers a promising framework for dark matter research, potentially explaining observed phenomena within astrophysical and particle physics constraints without conflicting with current experimental data.

Abstract: We present a new model of the dark sector involving Dirac fermion dark
matter, with axial coupling to a dark photon which provides a portal to
Standard Model particles. In the non-relativistic limit, this implies that the
dominant effective operator relevant to direct detection is ${\cal O}_8$. The
resulting event rate for direct detection is suppressed by either the dark
matter velocity or the momentum transfer. In this scenario there are much wider
regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with all of the
existing constraints associated with thermal relic density, direct detection
and collider searches.

*Abhiram Kaushik,Heikki Mäntysaari,Jani Penttala*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution to diffractive structure functions in high-energy deep inelastic scattering, focusing on the finite next-to-leading-order part. It shows that previous approximations (valid only in high-$Q^2$ or high-$M_X^2$ limits for soft gluons) inadequately approximate the full contribution and identifies an equally significant soft quark contribution at high $Q^2$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies in prior phenomenological applications that used limited approximations (high-$Q^2$/high-$M_X^2$) for the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution and to explore additional contributions beyond soft gluons.

Method: The authors computed the finite part of the next-to-leading-order $q\bar{q}g$ contribution to diffractive structure functions. They compared their results with previous estimates under restrictive limits and analyzed the role of soft quark contributions.

Result: Demonstrated that existing approximations (soft gluon contributions in specific limits) do not accurately represent the full $q\bar{q}g$ contribution. Found that soft quark contributions are equally important at high $Q^2$.

Conclusion: Full next-to-leading-order calculations are necessary for precise predictions, and soft quark effects must be included alongside gluon contributions in high-$Q^2$ analyses.

Abstract: We compute the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution to the diffractive structure
functions in high-energy deep inelastic scattering. The obtained result
corresponds to a finite part of the next-to-leading-order contribution to the
diffractive cross section. Previous phenomenological applications have included
this contribution only in the high-$Q^2$ or high-$M_X^2$ limits in the case of
a soft gluon, and we numerically demonstrate that these existing estimates do
not provide a good approximation for the full $q\bar{q}g$ contribution.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to the soft gluon contribution,
there is an equally important soft quark contribution to the diffractive
structure functions at high $Q^2$.

*Shu-Peng Wang,Zhen-Yan Lu,Zhi-Jun Ma,Rong-Yao Yang,Jian-Feng Xu,Xiangyun Fu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study modifies the perturbative QCD model by adding a term to address thermodynamic inconsistencies, allowing a maximum ud quark star mass of 2.17 M☉. With GW170817 tidal constraints, this drops to 2.08 M☉, ruling out ud quark stars for the 2.50-2.67 M☉ object in GW190814.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve thermodynamic inconsistencies in conventional perturbative QCD models at low densities and ensure compatibility with observational data like nuclear physics and gravitational wave events.

Method: Introduced a new term in the thermodynamic potential density to satisfy thermodynamic consistency. Simulated ud quark matter properties under constraints from energy per baryon (≥930 MeV) and tidal deformability from GW170817.

Result: Maximum mass of ud quark stars reaches 2.17 M☉ under basic constraints, reduced to ≤2.08 M☉ with tidal deformability constraints. The 2.5-2.67 M☉ object in GW190814 cannot be an ud quark star per this model.

Conclusion: The revised model supports PSR J0740+6620 as a possible ud quark star but excludes higher-mass objects like GW190814's from being ud quark stars, highlighting the need for alternative explanations for ultra-massive compact objects.

Abstract: A recent study shows that incorporating a new term into the thermodynamic
potential density, as required by the thermodynamic consistency criterion, can
effectively resolve the thermodynamic inconsistency problems of the
conventional perturbative QCD model. This additional term plays a crucial role
in resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible
at extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we
find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark
matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics,
the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD
model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed
2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if
we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4
$M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the
maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no
more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact
object with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event,
cannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model.

Abstract: In this paper we explore the potential of Ultra-peripheral Collisions in the
LHC to investigate new physics, focusing specifically on the production of new
charged vector bosons ${V}^{\pm}$ that decay into heavy neutral leptons $N_{L}$
in the context of the Vector Scotogenic Model. We show that the ATLAS
experiment searching for dilepton+met final states through UPCs of lead ions,
can prove the existence of new charged vector bosons in the mass range 5-100
GeV, a region not explored by the LEP-II experiment. Our analysis identifies
regions in the parameter space where the signal can be distinguished from the
background with high statistical significance. Within the mass range 5 GeV
$<M_{V^{\pm}}, M_{N_L}<$ 100 GeV, ATLAS can exclude scenarios with 95\% of C.L.
for specific mass scenarios such as (30 GeV, 20 GeV), (30 GeV, 10 GeV) and (20
GeV, 10 GeV). In a discovery context, ATLAS could reach a significance of
5$\sigma$ only for (20 GeV, 10 GeV). Furthermore, we show that in the absence
of new physics signals at ATLAS, the High Luminosity LHC with UPCs of protons
could explore further into larger mass ranges, specifically 100 GeV $<
M_{V^{\pm}}<$ 200 GeV and 5 GeV $<M_{N_L}<$ 200 GeV. We find that the HL-LHC
can exclude this mass range with 95\% of C.L., and most scenarios can achieve a
discovery significance of 5$\sigma$

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how finite volume systems affect critical phenomena beyond momentum space constraints, particularly for observables like kurtosis measured in heavy ion collisions.

Method: Developed an effective model analyzing scaling properties of chiral/order parameter and baryon number fluctuations in finite systems. Investigated kurtosis changes along approximate freeze-out curves considering system size effects.

Result: Demonstrated pronounced finite volume effects on kurtosis near critical points and first-order transitions. Observed system-size dependent scaling behaviors in charge fluctuations which deviate from infinite volume predictions.

Conclusion: Finite volume must be carefully considered in interpreting experimental data from relativistic heavy ion collisions, as system size significantly affects fluctuation observables used to locate phase boundaries.

Abstract: An effective model is introduced to illustrate finite volume effects beyond
the usual momentum space constraints. The fluctuations of the chiral order
parameter and the net baryon number, as well as their scaling properties, are
investigated near a critical point and a first-order transition in finite size
systems. The finite volume effects on the kurtosis are shown in detail along
the approximate freeze-out line. Several implications of the finite volume in
the charge fluctuations are discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study Quantum Chromodynamics and proton structure through heavy-flavor hadron + vector boson production, particularly focusing on the previously unexplored $W^\pm D^{(*)\mp}$ channels and their sensitivity to the proton's strange quark content.

Method: Computed NNLO QCD predictions for $W^\pm D^{(*)\mp}$ cross sections, performed PDF profiling using ATLAS data to assess sensitivity to the proton's strange sea quark distribution, and compared theoretical results with experimental measurements.

Result: Theoretical predictions align well with ATLAS data. PDF profiling showed significant sensitivity to the strange quark content, indicating these measurements can constrain proton parton distribution functions effectively.

Conclusion: The calculated $W^\pm D^{(*)\mp}$ observables are valuable for precision PDF determinations, offering a new probe to refine our understanding of proton structure and QCD dynamics.

Abstract: The production of heavy-flavor hadrons in association with a vector boson in
proton-proton collisions is a powerful probe for studying Quantum
Chromodynamics and the content of protons. In this article, we provide, for the
first time, differential predictions through NNLO for the production of
$W^{\pm}D^{(*)\mp}$ final states. The results are compared to recent ATLAS
measurements, and the sensitivity to the strange content of the proton is
investigated by PDF profiling. The results are found to be promising for
including $W^{\pm}D^{(*)\mp}$ measurements in proton-proton collisions in PDF

*Anatolii Iu. Egorov,Victor T. Kim,Viktor A. Murzin,Vadim A. Oreshkin*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the search for large extra dimensions in gravity using collider data, focusing on high-mass dijet production in the trans-Planckian eikonal regime where the partonic center-of-mass energy exceeds the Planck scale in higher dimensions. NLL BFKL formalism is applied to calculate QCD backgrounds for HL-LHC and future colliders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore potential evidence of large extra dimensions in gravity by analyzing unique signatures in particle collisions at high energies, beyond the standard model predictions. The study aims to distinguish gravitational effects from QCD backgrounds using precise theoretical frameworks.

Method: The method involves utilizing the Gribov-Regge limit of QCD for SM background analysis and calculating signal cross sections for large extra dimension gravity models within the trans-Planckian eikonal regime. The analysis employs NLL BFKL formalism to accurately model the QCD background contributions.

Result: Results include estimations of both gravitational signals from extra dimensions and the corresponding NLL BFKL QCD backgrounds at HL-LHC, FCCpp, and CEPC-SppC. These estimates help assess the feasibility of observing such signatures at current and future collider energies.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that high-luminosity and future colliders can effectively probe the sensitivity required to detect gravitational effects from large extra dimensions by analyzing high-mass dijet events with large rapidity gaps, provided the Planck scale is within reach of these experimental setups.

Abstract: Search for the large extra dimension gravity at collider energies is
considered in trans-Planckian eikonal regime, i. e., when $\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gg
M_D \gg \sqrt{-\hat{t}}$. Here $\hat{s}$ and $\hat{t}$ are the Mandelstam
variables of colliding parton-parton system and $M_D$ is the Planck mass scale
in the space-time with compactified $n_D$ extra dimensions. The main observable
of the large extra dimension gravity in trans-Planckian eikonal regime is a
cross section of high mass ($M_{jj}\sim\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gg M_D$) dijet
production with large rapidity separation. In the trans-Planckian eikonal
regime the Gribov-Regge limit of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
($\sqrt{s}\gg\sqrt{-t}\gg\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}$) is the main source of the
standard model background. The calculation of the QCD background should be done
within the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) approximation of
Lipatov-Fadin-Kuraev-Balitsky (BFKL) formalism. In this work the signal of the
large extra dimension gravity as well as the NLL BFKL QCD background are
estimated for the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and future
colliders such as FCCpp and CEPC-SppC.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates a potential light Higgs-like scalar at 95 GeV using the flipped Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM-F) at the CEPC. It uses Higgsstrahlung processes with tau and b-quark decay channels, applying particle-level transformers (ParT/MIParT) to enhance precision by factors of 2.4 and 1.4, respectively, compared to cut-based methods. The CEPC could achieve 5σ discovery for coupling strengths above 1.6e-2 (tau) and 4.2e-3 (b), with 1% precision for higher couplings. This underscores ML's role in future Higgs exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore experimental hints of a 95 GeV Higgs-like excess and assess the CEPC's capability to discover/measure such a state using advanced ML techniques.

Method: Simulated Higgsstrahlung processes $e^+e^-→ZS$ with $S→ττ$ and $b\bar{b}$ decays at CEPC (240 GeV). Used full Monte Carlo with detector effects, comparing ParT/MIParT ML against cut-based analysis.

Result: ML improves precision by 2.4× (ττ) and 1.4× (bb). Discovery reach at 5σ requires $μ_{ττ}^{ZS}>1.6×10^{-2}$, $μ_{bb}^{ZS}>4.2×10^{-3}$. Precision of 1% achievable for higher couplings.

Conclusion: Particle-level ML significantly boosts light Higgs detection potential at lepton colliders, supporting the CEPC's role in extending Higgs program beyond LHC.

Abstract: Several experimental analyses have reported mild excesses near 95\,GeV that
could indicate the presence of a light Higgs-like scalar. We study the
phenomenology of such a state within the flipped Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet
Model (N2HDM-F) at the proposed Circular Electron--Positron Collider (CEPC).
The light scalar $S$ is investigated through the Higgsstrahlung process $e^+e^-
\to Z(\mu^+\mu^-)S$ with $S\to\tau^+\tau^-$ and $S\to b \bar{b}$ decay modes. A
full Monte Carlo simulation including detector effects is performed to estimate
the discovery reach and precision measurement potential. To maximize the
sensitivity, we employ particle-level transformer networks (ParT and MIParT)
that exploit correlations among all reconstructed objects. Compared with a
cut-based baseline, improves the expected measurement precision by a factor of
2.4 in the $\tau\tau$ channel and 1.4 in the $b b$ channel. %of data at
240\,GeV. For viable benchmark points in the N2HDM-F, the attainable precisions
on the signal rate reach 1.0\% and 0.63\%, respectively. Interpreted in a
model-independent framework, the CEPC can achieve a 5$\sigma$ discovery for
$\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS}>1.6\times10^{-2}$ and $\mu_{bb}^{ZS}>4.2\times10^{-3}$,
and reach a 1\% precision for $\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS}>0.96$ and
$\mu_{bb}^{ZS}>0.13$. These results highlight the potential of particle-level
machine learning techniques in extending the light-Higgs exploration program at
future lepton colliders.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The nominal duration of Euclid's main mission is six years, but current best
estimates indicate that the observatory has sufficient propellant to operate
for up to ~14 years in total. In this work, we advocate dedicating six of these
~8 additional years to repeating the main survey, covering approximately
one-third of the sky. This repetition would not only improve the sampling,
signal-to-noise, quality, and depth of the survey, but -- most importantly --
would provide a six-year time baseline between two epochs if executed in the
same sequence. The availability of multiple epochs would enable the derivation
of proper motions for stars as faint as V~27, i.e., more than five magnitudes
fainter than those measured by the Gaia mission. Although it may seem early to
propose such a mission extension, in this work we quantitatively illustrate its
immense scientific potential. We therefore intend to initiate the technical and
scientific discussions early to ensure optimal planning. The here proposed
extension would employ only the VIS channel -- owing to its superior
astrometric capability and depth -- while simultaneously using NISP in
slitless-spectroscopy mode to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of first-epoch
spectra that would also benefit of proper motions to identify and reject
objects within the local Universe.

*Siddharth Chaini,Federica B. Bianco,Ashish Mahabal*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: DiMMAD is a novel anomaly detection method using an ensemble of distance metrics to improve performance in high-dimensional astronomical data by overcoming the limitation of relying on a single distance metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distance-based methods in anomaly detection depend on a single distance metric, which may not be optimal for complex, high-dimensional astronomical feature spaces. The need to address the metric-selection problem and enhance anomaly detection performance, especially for novel classes, drives the development of DiMMAD.

Method: DiMMAD employs an ensemble of diverse distance metrics to compute anomaly scores, effectively using multiple geometries in the feature space. This approach avoids dependency on a single metric and combines results to identify anomalies more effectively.

Result: DiMMAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in out-of-distribution anomaly detection, particularly in discovering diverse new classes. It performs similarly to others in rare in-distribution anomalies but offers better interpretability. Results are demonstrated using simulated Vera Rubin Observatory data and real Zwicky Transient Facility data.

Conclusion: The ensemble method in DiMMAD successfully mitigates the limitations of single-metric approaches, enhancing anomaly detection in astronomy by improving discovery diversity and interpretability. The open-source implementation supports reproducibility and further scientific use.

Abstract: Distance-based methods involve the computation of distance values between
features and are a well-established paradigm in machine learning. In anomaly
detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data
points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single,
user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for
the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we
introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly
Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find
novelties.
  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different
geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance
metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score
that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this
multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery
on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C.
Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the
Zwicky Transient Facility.
  We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection --
anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other
state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes
discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs
similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability. All
our code is open source: DiMMAD is implemented within DistClassiPy:
https://github.com/sidchaini/distclassipy/, while all code to reproduce the
results of this paper is available here: https://github.com/sidchaini/dimmad/.

Motivation: Expand the versatility and accessibility of Magrathea to handle diverse planetary compositions and facilitate user adaptation for customized research needs.

Method: The update introduces a modular framework for equations of state (EOSs), expanded phase diagrams, new composition retrieval tools, and enhanced code modularity to ease customization.

Result: Magrathea v2 now supports a wider range of planetary compositions, offers improved tools for analyzing planetary layer structures, and simplifies code adaptation for researchers.

Conclusion: The upgraded version strengthens Magrathea's role as a versatile platform for planetary interior modeling, enabling more accurate studies of differentiated planets across various research scenarios.

Abstract: Magrathea is an open-source C++ code for modeling the internal structure of
differentiated planets. The initial release, Huang et al. (2022), introduced
the base solver, a modular framework for defining equations of state (EOSs)
used within phase diagrams for each differentiated layer, and outlined a series
of planned extensions. Many of those updates are now implemented. Magrathea v2
is a more versatile platform that supports a winder range of compositions, adds
new tools for composition retrieval, and makes it easier for users to adapt the
code to their own models.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can identify candidate monosemantic features from pretrained neural networks (Zoobot and MAE models) for galaxy morphology analysis, showing stronger alignment with Galaxy Zoo labels compared to PCA. The self-supervised MAE model achieves superhuman image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of PCA in identifying features beyond human-defined classification frameworks and to explore the potential of SAEs in discovering interpretable astrophysical features beyond traditional galaxy morphology classifications.

Method: 1. Apply SAEs to pretrained neural networks (supervised Zoobot and self-supervised MAE) on Euclid Q1 images. 2. Compare SAE-derived features with PCA results from the supervised model. 3. Evaluate alignment of features with Galaxy Zoo labels and decision tree.

Result: SAEs identified interpretable features outside the Galaxy Zoo framework, showed stronger alignment with Galaxy Zoo labels than PCA, and the MAE model demonstrated superhuman image reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: SAEs offer a powerful tool for discovering astrophysical phenomena beyond human-defined classifications, though interpretability challenges persist. This highlights the potential of self-supervised models like MAE in advancing automated feature discovery in astronomy.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can efficiently identify candidate monosemantic
features from pretrained neural networks for galaxy morphology. We demonstrate
this on Euclid Q1 images using both supervised (Zoobot) and new self-supervised
(MAE) models. Our publicly released MAE achieves superhuman image
reconstruction performance. While a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the
supervised model primarily identifies features already aligned with the Galaxy
Zoo decision tree, SAEs can identify interpretable features outside of this
framework. SAE features also show stronger alignment than PCA with Galaxy Zoo
labels. Although challenges in interpretability remain, SAEs provide a powerful
engine for discovering astrophysical phenomena beyond the confines of
human-defined classification.

the LBT Italia night logs during INAF's observing time and assess the
scientific impact of each instrument. Between 2014 and 2025 LBT Italia produced
an average of 14 referred publication per year, based on an annual average of
311 hours of on-sky time. This corresponds to approximately 2.2 nights of
telescope time per publication. The results of this analysis are placed in an
international context to evaluate the competitiveness of LBT, and we outline

### [57] [CSST Slitless Spectra: Target Detection and Classification with YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24087)
*Yingying Zhou,Chao Liu,Hao Tian,Xin Zhang,Nan Li*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework based on YOLO models to address spatial uncertainty and spectral blending in CSST slitless spectroscopy, enabling end-to-end detection, classification, and analysis of spectral traces without traditional preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome errors from traditional pipelines in slitless spectroscopy, which accumulate errors due to multiple steps, and handle challenges like spatial uncertainty and spectral blending in crowded fields.

Method: Uses YOLOv5 for detecting compact zero-order and extended first-order spectral traces. Extends to YOLO11 for classifying sources (star/galaxy) and estimating redshift bins, processing raw 2D images holistically.

Result: Achieved high detection precision with YOLOv5 and successful quasar identification/redshift binning with YOLO11, demonstrating efficient processing and reduced error accumulation.

Conclusion: Establishes machine learning as a paradigm shift for slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification, and parameter estimation in a scalable system, with future work targeting continuous parameter prediction.

Abstract: Addressing the spatial uncertainty and spectral blending challenges in CSST
slitless spectroscopy, we present a deep learning-driven, end-to-end framework
based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models. This approach directly detects,
classifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing
traditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both
compact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded
fields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy)
and discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins),
showcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing.
Our framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial
features holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection
precision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned
redshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a
paradigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification,
and preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system. Future research will
concentrate on direct, continuous prediction of astrophysical parameters from
raw spectral traces.

### [58] [Optimising Underwater Neutrino Telescopes for All-Flavour Point Source Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24395)
*Iwan Morton-Blake,Fuyudi Zhang,Qichao Chang,Shuhua Hao,Weilun Huang,Hualin Mei,Wei Tian,Yingwei Wang,Xin Xiang,Donglian Xu*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study evaluates the performance of large underwater neutrino telescopes, using the TRIDENT array as a case. It finds that simply increasing detector volume isn't effective, but taller strings and optimized layouts improve discovery potential, with underwater optical properties critically influencing design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize next-generation neutrino detector designs for better source studies, moving beyond initial detections. The goal is balancing track-like (muon neutrinos) and cascade (all flavours) event analyses to enhance performance across different source types.

Method: A performance comparison of various detector configurations against TRIDENT's baseline design. Key parameters include detector volume expansion, string height, cluster distribution, and optical module density, using discovery time for astrophysical sources as the metric.

Result: Increasing volume alone doesn't improve performance; taller strings yield modest gains. Dense string clusters worsen discovery potential. Optimal layout requires understanding local water optical properties, necessitating in-situ measurements.

Conclusion: Detector layout optimization must prioritize engineering constraints and water optical properties. Early deployment of modules and in-situ data are critical for effective design, moving beyond simplistic volume scaling.

Abstract: High-energy neutrino astronomy has advanced rapidly in recent years, with
IceCube, KM3NeT, and Baikal-GVD establishing a diffuse astrophysical flux and
pointing to promising source candidates. These achievements mark the transition
from first detections to detailed source studies, motivating next-generation
detectors with larger volumes, improved angular resolution, and full
neutrino-flavour sensitivity. We present a performance study of large
underwater neutrino telescopes, taking the proposed TRIDENT array in the South
China Sea as a case study, with a focus on comparing the performance of various
detector configurations against the TRIDENT baseline design. Both track-like
events primarily from muon neutrinos, which provide precise directional
information, and cascade events from all flavours, which offer superior energy
resolution, diffuse-source sensitivity, and all-sky flavour coverage, are
included to achieve a balanced performance across source types. The time to
discover potential astrophysical sources with both track- and cascade-like
events is used as the figure of merit to compare a variety of detector design
choices. Our results show that, for a fixed number of optical modules, simply
enlarging the instrumented volume does not inherently lead to improved
performance, while taller strings can provide modest gains across all detector
channels, within engineering constraints. Distributing dense clusters of
strings over a large volume is found to generally worsen discovery potential
compared to the baseline layout. Finally, the optical properties of the
sea-water emerge as the key factor dictating the optimisation of detector
layout, highlighting the need for in-situ measurements and early deployment of
optical modules to guide the final array configuration.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper presents an in-situ processing approach using the Hecuba framework to enable real-time visualization of cosmological N-body simulations by integrating with the ChaNGa simulator, addressing data storage and access challenges in exascale computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of astronomical and cosmological simulation data poses challenges for storage and real-time analysis. Traditional methods are bottlenecked by the need to write large datasets to disk during exascale computing, limiting performance and accessibility.

Method: Integration of the Hecuba distributed database framework with the ChaNGa cosmological simulator. This allows streaming simulation data directly into visualization tools like ParaView and VisIVO, enabling concurrent analysis and bypassing the need to store full datasets.

Result: Real-time in-situ visualization is achieved, demonstrating successful processing and visualization of N-body simulation data without full dataset storage. This approach reduces I/O bottlenecks and improves scalability for exascale computing environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method (Hecuba-chaNGa integration) effectively solves storage and performance issues in A&C simulations. It opens new avenues for interactive exploration of large-scale data, crucial for upcoming exascale-era scientific investigations.

Abstract: Modern simulations and observations in Astronomy & Cosmology (A&C) produce
massively large data volumes, posing significant challenges for storage, access
and data analysis. A long-standing bottleneck in high-performance computing,
especially now in the exascale era, has been the requirement to write these
large datasets to disks, which limits the performance. A promising solution to
this challenge is in-situ processing, where analysis and visualization are
performed concurrently with the simulation itself, bypassing the storage of the
simulation data. In this work, we present new results from an approach for
in-situ processing based on Hecuba, a framework that provides a highly
distributed database for streaming A&C simulation data directly into the
visualization pipeline to make possible on-line visualization. By integrating
Hecuba with the high-performance cosmological simulator ChaNGa, we enable
real-time, in-situ visualization of N-body simulation results using tools such
as ParaView and VisIVO.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper presents a solution to the challenge of handling large-scale astronomical simulation data by integrating Hecuba, a distributed database, with the Changa simulator and visualization tools like ParaView and VisIVO for real-time in-situ analysis and visualization, avoiding the need for full data storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of high-quality astronomical and cosmological simulation data has created bottlenecks in data storage and visualization, as traditional methods either require storing vast amounts of data or reduce data resolution/volume, which hinders effective scientific analysis.

Method: The authors integrate Hecuba's distributed database framework with the Changa cosmological simulator, enabling in-situ visualization by streaming data directly to tools like ParaView and VisIVO without writing full results to disk.

Result: Successful demonstration of Hecuba's platform integration with Changa, allowing real-time visualization of N-body simulation results through reduced storage requirements and improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: In-situ visualization using Hecuba significantly enhances the handling of petascale astronomical data by overcoming storage and visualization bottlenecks, offering a scalable solution for future large-scale simulations.

Abstract: The Astronomy & Cosmology (A&C) community is presently witnessing an
unprecedented growth in the quality and quantity of data coming from
simulations and observations. Writing results of numerical simulations to disk
files has long been a bottleneck in high-performance computing. To access
effectively and extract the scientific content of such large-scale data sets
appropriate tools and techniques are needed. This is especially true for
visualization tools, where petascale data size problems cannot be visualized
without some data filtering, which reduces either the resolution or the amount
of data volume managed by the visualization tool.
  A solution to this problem is to run the analysis and visualization
concurrently (in-situ) with the simulation and bypass the storage of the full
results. In particular we use Hecuba, a framework offering a highly distributed
database to stream A\&C simulation data for on-line visualization. We will
demonstrate the Hecuba platform integration with the Changa high performant
cosmological simulator and the in-situ visualization of its N-body results with
the ParaView and VisIVO tools.

### [61] [Thin-shell wormhole with a background Kalb-Ramond Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23689)
*Arya Dutta,Farook Rahaman*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the construction and properties of a thin-shell wormhole using Kalb-Ramond field-induced modified black holes. It examines energy conditions, exotic matter requirements, and stability under perturbations, finding the wormhole violates null/weak energy conditions but satisfies the strong one, with stability depending on Lorentz-violating parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate Lorentz-violating effects on wormhole physics by incorporating Kalb-Ramond field interactions, which modify black hole solutions and allow analysis of novel spacetime structures under these conditions.

Method: Constructs a thin-shell wormhole via Cut-and-Paste technique from two Kalb-Ramond-modified black holes. Analyzes pressure-density profiles, equation of state, geodesic motion, exotic matter distribution, energy condition violations, and linear stability against radial perturbations.

Result: The wormhole violates null/weak energy conditions but satisfies the strong condition. Exotic matter is localized at the throat, with properties dependent on Lorentz-violating parameters. The throat's velocity and stability under perturbations are quantified, showing parameter-dependent stability.

Conclusion: Lorentz-violating Kalb-Ramond fields enable viable thin-shell wormhole models with specific energy condition behaviors. Stability hinges on parameter choices, suggesting new avenues for studying modified gravity in Lorentz-breaking contexts.

Abstract: The Kalb-Ramond field is a background tensor field that arises in string
theory and violates local Lorentz symmetry of spacetime, upon acquiring the
Vacuum Expectation Value. A non-minimal coupling between the Kalb-Ramond VEV
and the Ricci tensor may give rise to a modified black hole solution.
Considering two copies of such black holes, we construct a thin-shell wormhole
using the Cut-and-Paste technique. Then we investigate key physical properties
of the wormhole like pressure-density profile, equation of state, the geodesic
motion of test particles near the wormhole throat, and the total amount of
exotic matter in the throat, and examine how these properties vary with the
Lorentz-Violating parameters. We find that the wormhole model violates the null
and weak energy conditions, but satisfies the strong energy condition. On top
of that, the velocity of the throat radius is found considering its time
evolution. Finally, we analyze its linear stability against small radial
perturbations.

### [62] [Conundrum of regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23711)
*Ana Bokulić,Tajron Jurić,Ivica Smolić*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields, showing dependencies among Komar mass, charge, and magnetic charge. It generalizes a no-go theorem about Kretschmann scalar behavior and constructs a dyonic black hole solution, highlighting the costs of using nonlinear extensions for regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the viability of regular black hole solutions in theories with nonlinear electromagnetism, addressing the trade-offs between achieving regularity and maintaining physically reasonable assumptions.

Method: Analyzing the interdependencies of Komar mass, electric, and magnetic charges in static, spherically symmetric black holes. Generalizing a no-go theorem under Maxwellian weak field limits and constructing a dyonic solution within such theories.

Result: Established mutual dependencies between Komar mass and charges, confirmed the no-go theorem for Kretschmann scalar boundedness, and successfully created a dyonic regular black hole solution, showing that nonlinear extensions require unorthodox assumptions.

Conclusion: Regularizing black holes via nonlinear electromagnetism necessitates theoretical compromises, suggesting that simple nonlinear extensions may not be sufficient without introducing unconventional assumptions.

Abstract: The search for regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields has
sprouted numerous candidates, each exhibiting certain virtues but often
accompanied by significant drawbacks. We demonstrate that Komar mass, electric
charge and magnetic charge are mutually dependent in regular black holes with
nonlinear electromagnetic fields, defined by Lagrangian which is a function of
both electromagnetic invariants, $F_{ab} F^{ab}$ and $F_{ab}{\star F}^{ab}$,
regardless of the specific weak field limit of the theory. Also, we generalize
one of the key no-go theorems by showing that static, spherically symmetric,
electrically charged black holes in a theory respecting the relaxed Maxwellian
weak field limit do not admit a bounded Kretschmann scalar. Finally, we address
one of the long-standing niche questions, whether regular black hole solutions
can exist when both electric and magnetic charges are present, by constructing
an exotic family of regular dyonic black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic
fields in theories respecting the Maxwellian weak field limit. Mounting
evidence suggests that regularizing black holes through simplistic nonlinear
extensions of Maxwell's electromagnetism entails a high cost in the form of
unorthodox theoretical assumptions.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines black-bounce spacetimes' shadows using semi-analytical methods and ray-tracing, finding observable features like double rings that could distinguish these objects from classical black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test gravitational theories on astrophysical scales using EHT observations and explore how black-bounce spacetimes, which interpolate between regular black holes and wormholes, produce unique shadow signatures.

Method: Semi-analytical analysis of photon orbits to determine critical impact parameter and shadow radius, combined with numerical simulations using GYOTO code for ray-tracing with accretion disks and varying observation angles.

Result: Identified characteristic signatures like double-ring structures and shadow radius deformations, which can differentiate black-bounce solutions from classical black holes.

Conclusion: Observational features of black-bounce shadows provide discriminators for testing alternative gravity models, highlighting the potential of EHT data to probe beyond classical GR predictions.

Abstract: The existence of black hole shadows is one of the most interesting effects of
the strong field regime of general relativity (GR). Recent observations by the
Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have provided high-resolution images of the
vicinity of supermassive black holes, ushering in a new era for testing
gravitation on astrophysical scales. In this work, we continue the
investigation initiated by \cite{furtado2025gravitational}, focusing on shadows
associated with generalized $k-n$ \emph{black-bounce} type spacetimes, which
smoothly interpolate between regular black holes and wormholes. We consider a
generalization of the metric with free parameters $(a,k,n)$ that modify the
mass function and enrich the possible phenomenology. We develop a
semi-analytical study of photon orbits, obtaining the critical impact parameter
and the shadow radius for different parameter combinations. Subsequently, we
perform numerical ray-tracing simulations using the \textsc{GYOTO} code,
incorporating optically thick accretion disks and varying the observation
angle. Our results reveal characteristic signatures, including the formation of
double-ring structures and deformations of the shadow radius, which can serve
as observational discriminators between classical black holes and
\emph{black-bounce} solutions.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The unstably bound, critical null geodesics of the Kerr spacetime form a
distinguished class of orbits whose properties govern observables such as the
photon ring and the high-frequency component of black-hole ringdown. This set
of orbits defines a codimension-two submanifold of the null-geodesic phase
space known as the photon shell. In this work we investigate the photon shell's
intrinsic symplectic geometry. Using the induced symplectic form, we construct
the canonical volume form on the shell and compute the differential phase-space
volume it encloses as a function of radius -- equivalently, the radial density
of states. In the near-extremal limit the photon shell bifurcates into
near-horizon and far-region components; we find that approximately $3\%$ of the
shell's phase-space volume resides in the near-horizon component. We also
analyze a thickening of the photon shell that includes near-critical orbits,
and compute its differential phase-space volume. Beyond their intrinsic
theoretical interest, these results may inform the interpretation of
high-resolution observations of spinning black holes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theory-agnostic framework to detect extra-fundamental modes in black hole merger ringdowns, which could indicate gravity theory modifications. Analysis of GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129 events found no significant evidence beyond General Relativity predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore potential deviations from General Relativity by searching for non-standard gravitational wave modes in black hole ringdowns, which could arise from alternative gravity theories.

Method: Developed a theory-agnostic framework analyzing ringdown signals to identify extra-fundamental modes without assuming specific gravity modifications. Applied this method to three gravitational wave events.

Result: No statistically significant evidence for extra modes beyond GR expectations was found in the analyzed events.

Conclusion: Current data does not support the existence of extra-fundamental modes in black hole ringdowns, suggesting no need for modifications to GR in this context based on the observed events.

Abstract: We present a theory-agnostic framework to search for extra-fundamental modes
in the ringdown phase of black hole mergers. These modes, distinct from
standard General Relativity (GR) deviations, originate from modifications of
the theory of gravity. Applying our method to the events GW150914, GW190521,
and GW200129, we find no significant evidence for extra modes beyond those

TL;DR: This paper sets upper limits on gravitational-wave energy from core-collapse supernovae using LIGO/Virgo O3 data and discusses future detection prospects with third-generation detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect the gravitational-wave background (GWB) from CCSNe and improve upon previous constraints.

Method: Cross-correlation analysis of Advanced LIGO and Virgo data during O3 run, accounting for CBC contributions.

Result: Achieved a 95% upper limit of 0.01 M⊙c², enhancing prior limits by two orders of magnitude. Future detectors may detect individual CCSNe before the GWB.

Conclusion: Third-gen detectors like Einstein Telescope could enable individual CCSNe detection before observing the GWB, highlighting the importance of CCSNe in GWB studies.

Abstract: A gravitational-wave background (GWB) arising from the superposition of
numerous unresolved gravitational-wave signals has yet to be detected.
Potential contributing sources to such a background include compact binary
coalescences (CBCs) and core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In this work, we
place upper limits on the gravitational-wave energy emitted by CCSNe using
cross-correlation measurements made with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
detectors during their third observing run (O3). Specifically, we obtain a
$95\%$ credibility upper limit of $0.01~ {M_\odot c^2}$ while accounting for
the contribution from CBC sources to a GWB. This result improves on previous
constraint obtained from initial LIGO data by approximately two orders of
magnitude. We also explore the detection prospects of third-generation
ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer for
both individual CCSNe events and the GWB. Our results show that single events
are likely to be detected prior to the GWB.

### [67] [Imperfect dark matter with higher derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23838)
*Mohammad Ali Gorji*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a higher-derivative action for dark matter, modeled as an imperfect fluid, which avoids caustic singularities by introducing pressure, energy flux, and anisotropic stress without altering cosmological dynamics on homogeneous backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the caustic singularity problem in mimetic dark matter and address inhomogeneities without altering established cosmological dynamics on large scales.

Method: Extending singular conformal transformations in mimetic dark matter to include higher-derivative terms, deriving an energy-momentum tensor that becomes pressureless dust in the absence of these terms. Studying cosmological implications on both homogeneous and inhomogeneous scales.

Result: Higher-derivative terms induce acceleration and vorticity in inhomogeneous regions, preventing caustic formation even under the strong energy condition. Specifically resolves pathologies in mimetic dark matter scenarios.

Conclusion: The model successfully avoids caustic singularities while maintaining agreement with standard cosmological dynamics at large scales, offering a viable dark matter description with non-singular structure formation.

Abstract: We introduce a higher-derivative action for dark matter whose energy-momentum
tensor describes an imperfect fluid with nonzero pressure, energy flux, and
anisotropic stress. In the limit where the higher-derivative couplings are
switched off, the energy-momentum tensor reduces to pressureless dust. A
systematic derivation follows from extending the singular conformal
transformation used in the mimetic dark matter scenario to include
higher-derivative terms while the resulting action is general and does not rely
on the mimetic framework. On a homogeneous cosmological background, the
dynamics coincides with that of pressureless dust, while in the presence of
inhomogeneities the higher-derivative terms generate nonzero acceleration and
vorticity, making it possible to avoid the formation of caustic singularities
even if the strong energy condition satisfies. In particular, within the
mimetic realization these terms resolve the usual caustic pathology of mimetic
dark matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the dyadoregion where vacuum breakdown happens in strong electromagnetic fields near Kerr black holes, enabling better understanding of high-energy phenomena and plasma dynamics.

Method: Using the Wald solution, the study calculates the morphology of the dyadoregion and parameters including electromagnetic energy, pair-creation rate, pair density, and energy characteristics.

Result: Computed values for pair production parameters and plasma properties, providing initial conditions for simulating black hole interactions with plasmas in extreme fields.

Conclusion: These results advance modeling of high-energy astrophysical events involving black holes and strong electromagnetic fields by establishing foundational plasma parameters.

Abstract: We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum
breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical
electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the
presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned
with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the
dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available for the pairs, the
pair-creation rate, the number density of pairs, the average energy per pair,
and their energy density and pressure. These results provide initial conditions
for simulating the subsequent dynamics of the pair-produced plasma and
astrophysical applications in the context of high-energy transients involving
BHs in strong electromagnetic fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ISW effect is well-known for its role in CMB anisotropies, but the paper's motivation is to reverse-engineer this process to extract information about the primordial gravitational perturbations, focusing on their polarizations, which have not been as well-studied in this context.

Method: The authors analyze the inverse problem of the ISW effect's gravitational redshift mechanism, developing a framework to extract polarizations of primordial gravitational perturbations measurable via local CMB observations in the TT gauge.

Result: They demonstrate that ISW observations can indeed be used to identify and characterize the transversally traceless (TT) polarizations of early universe gravitational perturbations, providing a new observational handle on primordial gravity.

Conclusion: The study opens a pathway for using CMB ISW measurements to probe primordial gravitational waves, offering a novel method to test cosmological models and understand the universe's earliest moments through gravitational perturbation signatures.

Abstract: The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect describes how photons are
gravitationally redshifted, producing anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave
Background. We study the inverse problem and show that primordial gravitational

*Ruixin Yang,Songbai Chen,Jiliang Jing*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines how the Blandford-Znajek process's energy and angular momentum extraction are affected by the tidal charge in Randall-Sundrum braneworld black holes, showing that positive tidal charge reduces power output by up to 15.2%, while negative tidal charge increases it by up to 66.5% compared to Kerr black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of tidal charge on energy extraction mechanisms in braneworld black holes, expanding the understanding of relativistic astrophysical processes beyond standard Kerr BH models.

Method: Extended BZ monopole expansion framework applied to analyze braneworld BH magnetospheres, calculating power and angular momentum extraction rates under varying tidal charge conditions.

Result: Positive tidal charge reduces BZ power by up to 15.2%, negative tidal charge enhances it by 66.5%. Similar trends observed in angular momentum extraction, though magnitudes differ.

Conclusion: Tidal charge significantly modifies energy extraction efficiency in braneworld spacetimes, indicating braneworld effects must be considered when modeling astrophysical phenomena like jet power from supermassive BHs.

Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is a pivotal mechanism to efficiently
extract the energy from a rotating black hole (BH) via its plasma-filled
magnetosphere in relativistic astrophysics. Within the framework of extended BZ
monopole expansion, we have studied BZ process in the Randall-Sundrum
braneworld BH spacetime and analyzed effects of the tidal charge on the energy
and angular momentum extraction rates. It is found that the positive tidal
charge reduces the BZ power of a braneworld BH, while the negative tidal charge
enhances the power. Compared with a Kerr BH of the same mass and angular
velocity, the BZ power exhibits a maximum reduction of approximately $15.2\%$
in positive cases, whereas in negative cases, it achieves a maximum enhancement
of $66.5\%$ in power output. A similar qualitative trend is also observed for
the relative angular momentum extraction rate, albeit with different
magnitudes.

TL;DR: The paper extends the isolated horizon formalism to rotating five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes, showing modifications to the first law of black hole mechanics due to Gauss-Bonnet terms affecting horizon area and angular momentum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To incorporate rotating black holes in five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity into the isolated horizon framework, enabling analysis of modified black hole mechanics laws caused by higher curvature terms.

Method: Extending the isolated horizon formalism to 5D EGB theory, deriving modified laws of black hole mechanics, and demonstrating how Gauss-Bonnet terms adjust horizon area and angular momentum expressions within the Hamiltonian framework.

Result: The first law is modified with corrections to horizon area and angular momentum due to Gauss-Bonnet terms, ensuring the Hamiltonian correctly generates evolution on EGB solution spaces with isolated horizons as boundaries.

Conclusion: The derived boundary conditions provide a foundation for finding exact solutions of rotating EGB black holes and validate the role of Gauss-Bonnet terms in altering black hole thermodynamics.

Abstract: We extend the isolated horizon formalism to include rotating black holes
arising in five dimensional Einstein- Gauss- Bonnet (EGB) theory of gravity,
and derive the laws of black hole mechanics. This result allows us to show that
the first law of black hole mechanics is modified, due to the Gauss- Bonnet
term, so as to include corrections to (i) the area of horizon cross- sections
and, to (ii) the expression of horizon angular momentum. Once these
modifications are included, the Hamiltonian generates an evolution on the space
of solutions of the EGB theory admitting isolated horizon as an internal
boundary, the consequence of which is the first law of black hole mechanics.
These boundary conditions may help in the search for exact solutions describing
rotating black holes in this theory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We represent a new approach to exploring the thermodynamic topology of black
holes, without introducing the nonphysical variable $\Theta\in[0,\pi]$
considered in previous studies, where black holes can exchange both energy and
matter with the environment, leading to a thermal and chemical equilibrium. We
construct a conserved topological tensor based on the gradient flow of the
off-shell grand free energy corresponding to a two-dimensional or
higher-dimensional vector field whose zeros are black hole solutions. We obtain
a topological charge that is the sum of the index of all zeros. We find that
black holes that share the same background geometry would have the same
topological charge, hence they belong to the same kind of solutions. This point
implies that the topological charge characterizing the black hole
thermodynamics is also an invariant of spacetime, leading to valuable insight
into the observed cosmological constant and the AdS distance conjecture.

### [73] [Modified Gravity with Nonminimal Curvature-Matter Couplings: A Framework for Gravitationally Induced Particle Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24371)
*Francisco S. N. Lobo,Tiberiu Harko,Miguel A. S. Pinto*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores modified gravity theories with nonminimal matter-curvature coupling as alternatives to dark energy/matter. By using irreversible thermodynamics, it shows that particle creation from gravitational interactions can drive late-time cosmic acceleration via negative creation pressure, upholding the generalized second law of thermodynamics. Other methods like Boltzmann equation and quantum approaches are also discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a viable alternative to dark energy/matter by exploring nonminimal curvature-matter coupling in gravity theories, which allows energy exchange between matter and geometry. The study aims to understand gravitationally induced particle creation and its cosmological implications, such as de Sitter expansion and thermodynamic consistency.

Method: Adopts scalar-tensor formulation of modified gravity theories. Applies irreversible thermodynamics of open systems to derive particle creation rate, pressure, and entropy production. Compares with Boltzmann equation approaches, quantum-based generalizations of the Klein-Gordon equation, and quantization in time-varying spacetimes.

Result: Demonstrates that negative creation pressure from irreversible particle production can drive de Sitter acceleration without dark energy. Generalized second law holds as total entropy (horizon + matter) increases monotonically, stabilizing in de Sitter phase. Constraints on particle production dynamics are identified through entropy saturation analysis.

Conclusion: Nonminimal curvature-matter coupling provides a natural alternative to cosmological constant problems via particle creation mechanisms. Thermodynamic consistency and compatibility with observational acceleration confirm the viability of these theories. Further theoretical development is needed in quantum aspects and dynamic spacetime quantization.

Abstract: Modified gravity theories with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and
matter offer a compelling alternative to dark energy and dark matter by
introducing an explicit interaction between matter and curvature invariants.
Two of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an
additional force and the non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor, which
can be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By
adopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different
approaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced
particle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible
thermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor
formulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle
creation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that
irreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration
through a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the
cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second
law of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon
and enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter
phase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics.
Furthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of
matter creation processes. Specifically, we consider approaches based on the
Boltzmann equation and quantum-based aspects and discuss the generalization of
the Klein--Gordon equation, as well as the problem of its quantization in
time-varying gravitational fields.

### [74] [Results on Lorentzian metric spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24423)
*E. Minguzzi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores Lorentzian metric spaces as low-regularity globally hyperbolic spacetimes, proving the existence of a Cauchy time function under continuity and compactness conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a robust framework for spacetimes with low regularity by showing that Lorentzian metric spaces satisfy key properties of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, specifically admitting a Cauchy time function.

Method: Using the Lorentzian distance and chronological diamonds, the authors construct a proof for the existence of a Cauchy time function in these spaces. The method leverages minimal conditions (distance continuity and compactness) to ensure the space can be treated as a lower-regularity spacetime.

Result: Successful proof that all Lorentzian metric spaces admit a Cauchy time function, validated even in smooth spacetimes. This confirms the spaces' interpretation as low-regularity globally hyperbolic spacetimes.

Conclusion: The existence of Cauchy time functions in these spaces validates their use as low-regularity models, offering a constructive method applicable even in smooth cases and advancing the study of spacetimes with minimal differentiability requirements.

Abstract: We provide a short introduction to ``Lorentzian metric spaces" i.e.,
spacetimes defined solely in terms of the two-point Lorentzian distance. As
noted in previous work, this structure is essentially unique if minimal
conditions are imposed, such as the continuity of the Lorentzian distance and
the relative compactness of chronological diamonds. The latter condition is
natural for interpreting these spaces as low-regularity versions of globally
hyperbolic spacetimes. Confirming this interpretation, we prove that every
Lorentzian metric space admits a Cauchy time function. The proof is
constructive for this general setting and it provides a novel argument that is
interesting already for smooth spacetimes.

### [75] [Nonlocal stress-energy tensor in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24449)
*A. Boasso,F. D. Mazzitelli*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a massless quantum scalar field in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds. Despite finding that the first-order RSET doesn't capture particle energy emission, it identifies that enforcing stress-tensor conservation allows extraction of radiated energy from the first-order results. The study also uncovers unusual quantum metric corrections at large distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how quantum fields respond to dynamic spacetime geometries and to resolve inconsistencies in calculating energy emission from gravitational processes within perturbative quantum field theory.

Method: Covariant perturbative expansion of the RSET to lowest curvature order, multipole expansion for time-dependent spherically symmetric spacetimes, and analysis of stress-tensor conservation up to second-order in curvature.

Result: First-order RSET is non-vanishing at null infinity but doesn't account for particle energy; total radiated energy must include higher-order terms. Quantum metric corrections at large distances show unexpected properties not previously observed.

Conclusion: The study highlights the necessity of higher-order stress-tensor analysis for accurate energy radiation calculations and reveals non-trivial quantum gravity effects in dynamic spacetimes that challenge existing theoretical expectations.

Abstract: We analyze the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a massless quantum
scalar field in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds. Starting from its
formal expression obtained within the covariant perturbative expansion to
lowest order in the curvature, we evaluate the RSET in an arbitrary number of
dimensions in terms of coordinate-space distributions. For time-dependent
spherically symmetric spacetimes, we derive a multipole expansion and determine
its asymptotic behavior. We find that the RSET is locally nonvanishing at null
infinity and depends on the detailed dynamics of the collapsing body. However,
the total emitted energy vanishes at this order, meaning that the leading
contribution does not account for the energy density of the created particles.
Nevertheless, by enforcing stress-tensor conservation up to second order in the
curvature, we show that the total radiated energy can be extracted from the
first-order RSET. Finally, we compute the induced quantum corrections to the
metric at large distances, which display several unexpected features.

*Weike Deng,Sheng Long,Qin Tan,Jiliang Jing*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how charged black holes with scalar hair affect geodesic motion and gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals. The scalar hair parameter $r_B$ modifies orbital properties like marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circular orbits, and periodic orbits. Numerical kludge simulations show distinct waveform features, indicating detectability with future space-based detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore deviations from classical black hole spacetimes by studying gravitational-wave signatures of charged black holes with scalar hair, which could be detectable by future detectors like LISA.

Method: Analyzes geodesic motion using effective potential approaches to determine modified orbital properties (marginally bound, innermost stable) and periodic orbits labeled by $(z,w,v)$. Computes gravitational waveforms via the numerical kludge method to observe effects of scalar hair parameter $r_B$ on zoom-whirl patterns.

Result: Scalar hair parameter $r_B$ alters orbital boundaries and properties; gravitational waveforms show distinguishable zoom-whirl signatures influenced by $r_B$ that could probe beyond classical black hole predictions.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave observations from extreme mass-ratio inspirals with future space-based detectors may detect scalar hair effects, offering new tests of black hole structure and alternative gravity theories.

Abstract: We investigate geodesic motion and gravitational-wave signatures of charged
black holes with scalar hair. Using the effective potential approach, we
analyze marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, showing
how their positions and energy thresholds are modified by the scalar hair
parameter $r_B$. These results demonstrate scalar hair's role in altering the
boundary of stable motion. We further explore periodic orbits characterized by
rational frequency ratios, labeled by the index $(z,w,v)$, and quantify how
scalar hair affects their orbital energy and angular momentum. Based on these
orbital properties, we compute gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio
inspirals where a stellar-mass compact object orbits a supermassive charged
black hole with scalar hair. Using the numerical kludge method, we generate
waveforms that exhibit clear zoom-whirl patterns with morphology visibly
affected by $r_B$. Our results show that scalar hair leaves distinguishable
imprints on waveforms, suggesting future space-based detectors could probe
deviations from classical black hole spacetimes through extreme mass-ratio
inspirals observations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We discuss the connection between the entropy of the Hubble volume in de
Sitter spacetime and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm GH}=A/4G$ associated
with the cosmological horizon. In (3+1) spacetime, these two entropies
coincide, and hence the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture holds. This provides
physical meaning and a natural explanation to the Gibbons-Hawking entropy -- it
is the entropy in the volume $V_H$ bounded by the cosmological horizon. Here we
consider whether the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture remains valid for the de Sitter
state in general $d+1$ spacetime. To do this, we use local de Sitter
thermodynamics, characterized by a local temperature $T=H/\pi$. This
temperature is not related to the horizon: it is the temperature of local
activation processes, such as the ionization of an atom in the de Sitter
environment, which occur deep within the cosmological horizon. This local
temperature is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. Two
different ways of calculations of the entropy of the Hubble volume were
considered: integration of the local entropy density over the Hubble volume and
the first law of the de Sitter thermodynamics. In both cases we found that the
entropy of the Hubble volume is $S_H=(d-1)A/8G$, which modifies the
Gibbons-Hawking entropy of horizon. The original form of the Gibbons-Hawking is
valid only for $d=3$.

*Jonathan Gratus,Spyridon Talaganis,Willow Sparks*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to formulate distributional stress-energy tensors for uncharged and charged dust by shrinking an extended dust region to a point. It shows the uncharged case is divergence-free, while the charged case's divergence involves current and external electromagnetic fields, derived via coordinate-freesqueeze operations on regular dust tensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend multipole expansions to stress-energy tensors of charged/uncharged dust beyond point particles, capturing effects of shrinking extended regions to a point without self-interaction.

Method: Formulated stress-energy tensors as worldline integrals of delta-function derivatives, showed they can represent any multipole order. Derived divergence properties by squeezing regular dust tensors onto a worldline in a coordinate-free manner.

Result: Uncharged multipole stress-energy tensor is divergence-free. For charged case, divergence equals current plus Lorentz force term from external EM field. Validated through coordinate-independent calculations.

Conclusion: The coordinate-free framework successfully generalizes multipole expansions for point-like dust systems, offering a tool to model relativistic charged particles without self-interaction issues.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the distributional uncharged and charged
stress-energy tensors. These are integrals, along a worldline, of derivatives
of the delta-function. These distributions are also multipoles and they are
prescribed to any order. They represent an extended region of
non-self-interacting uncharged or charged dust, shrunken to a single point in
space. We show that the uncharged dust stress-energy multipole is
divergence-free, while the divergence of the charged dust stress-energy
multipole is given by the current and the external electromagnetic field. We
show that they can be obtained by squeezing a regular dust stress-energy tensor
onto the worldine. We discuss the aforementioned calculations in a
coordinate-free manner.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamical instability of a self-gravitating thermal system
in the quantum regime, where Fermi degeneracy pressure becomes significant.
Using a truncated Fermi-Dirac distribution and solving the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we identify marginally stable
configurations following Chandrasekhar's criterion. While Fermi pressure
stabilizes a system against gravitational collapse in Newtonian gravity, in
general relativity it can instead drive the instability, enabling collapse even
at low temperatures. We discuss implications for the formation of massive black
holes in the early Universe through the gravothermal collapse of dark matter.
