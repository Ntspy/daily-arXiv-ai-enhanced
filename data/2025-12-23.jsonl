The resonant trident process is defined by two characteristic quantum energies: the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Compton effect and the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. These characteristic energies depend significantly on the frequency and intensity of the wave, as well as on the angle between the momenta of the initial electrons and the electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is effective when the energy of the initial electrons is greater than or on the order of magnitude of the corresponding characteristic energies. It is shown that quantum entanglement of final particles takes place in this resonant process. An important aspect of the resonant trident process is the equality of the energies of the electron and positron pairs. Analytical expressions for the differential rates of the resonant trident process on the energy of final particles are obtained. The corresponding analytical expressions for full rates have also been obtained. It is shown that the rate data of the resonant trident process in the field of optical and X-ray wave frequencies significantly exceed the corresponding rate of the non-resonant trident process. Results obtained can be used in experiments at leading laser centers, as well as to explain QED processes in strong X-ray fields near neutron stars and magnetars."}

Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism."}

While BTZ black holes are stable under standard Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we demonstrate that they can develop instabilities when subjected to double-trace boundary conditions. Our key findings are threefold. First, we show that BTZ black holes exhibit instabilities not only for non-axisymmetric modes $\\unicode{x2013}$ previously the only known unstable sector $\\unicode{x2013}$ but crucially also for axisymmetric modes. Second, we prove that the axisymmetric instability is the dominant and most fundamental: configurations unstable to any non-axisymmetric mode are already unstable to the axisymmetric one. Third, we identify regions in the BTZ parameter space where these black holes are unstable while global AdS$_3$ remains stable, and we map the complete onset curves that determine the corresponding stability boundaries. Unlike conventional superradiant instabilities, the BTZ double-trace instability occurs for angular velocities always satisfying the Hawking-Reall bound. We trace the physical origin of these instabilities to the influx of energy and angular momentum through the asymptotic boundary permitted by double-trace deformations for a particular sign of the coupling, rather than to near-horizon effects. Our results provide a prototype for understanding double-trace instabilities in higher-dimensional rotating AdS black holes and suggest the existence of rotating hairy black hole solutions with scalar condensates, which we construct in a companion paper."}

Grand", "Martin Roth"], "title": "The Nature of Galactic Spiral Arms", "comment": "Submitted to the ESO call for White Papers", "summary": "Spiral arms are the defining features of broad morphological classes of disc galaxies, but their nature and influence on galaxy evolution is still under debate. A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies."}

Lensed images of the emission region, often referred to as photon rings in this context, are a direct consequence of the unstable dynamics of null geodesics near the spherical photon orbit in the Kerr spacetime. The order of the lensed image can be characterized by the number of half-orbits the photons complete before reaching the observer, with higher-order photon rings produced by null geodesics that circle the black hole more times. However, low-order rings are significantly influenced by the astrophysical environment. Measuring the Lyapunov exponent requires probing the exponentially small differences between successive photon rings or between photon rings and the shadow. We investigate potential astrophysical sources of systematic error the estimation of Lyapunov exponent, including the location of the observed emission, and especially at low photon ring order. We show that it is nevertheless possible to measure this purely gravitational quantity to roughly 10% and 1% systematic uncertainty by resolving the n=2 and n=3 photon rings with the shadow size, respectively. Therefore, the forthcoming black hole imaging efforts to capture, even if indirectly, the n=2 photon ring can result in a measurement of the Lyapunov exponent that is not limited by astrophysical uncertainties."}

White paper submitted to ESO Expanding Horizons call", "summary": "Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter."}

In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise."}

This extends a previous study that focused on scalar fields, to all fermion-scalar theories. Both Dirac and Majorana fermions and both Dirac and Majorana masses are covered. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic interacting fermion-scalar theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. These general results are applied to physical situations typical of neutron stars, which are often quickly rotating: the Fermi surface and Fermi momentum, the average energy, number density and angular momentum for degenerate fermions and particle production (such as neutrino production from rotating neutron stars, e.g. pulsars). In particular, it is shown that the neutrino production rate due to the direct URCA (DU) processes grows indefinitely as the angular velocity approaches the inverse linear size of the plasma and, therefore, rotation can significantly increase this rate."}

Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar.

Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures.

In particular, the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies exhibit an approximately arithmetic progression, suggesting that the quasi-localized states can be understood as resonances between the barriers."}

White paper submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call on behalf of ET OSB Div3", "summary": "Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \\simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\\sim 10^3 M_\\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \\gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation."}

This report presents SatTrack, a GUI-driven simulation framework that (i) tracks satellite motion relative to a fixed antenna boresight, (ii) predicts reflector gain patterns of a parabolic reflector antenna with a reconfigurable rim of specified size using a physical optics (PO) surface-current model decomposed into fixed and reconfigurable rim regions, and (iii) synthesizes deep, directional nulls using fast rim-weight optimization algorithms. Beyond baseline serial greedy and greedy bit-flip methods, additional files support advanced weight optimization algorithms including simulated annealing and majorization-minimization operating over higher-order complex weight alphabets, enabling deeper null formation. Interference power from satellites is estimated using free-space path loss and an FCC-derived Starlink EIRP versus steering-angle model, and event-level throughput for each satellite is computed using Shannon capacity. Results show simple binary rim control achieves about 40-55 dB of average interference suppression, while advanced optimization methods can exceed 65-70 dB under favorable geometries, with best-case received interference below -220 dBm. We compare no mitigation, satellite muting, and rim-based spatial nulling, showing rim-based nulling approaches muting-level suppression while preserving throughput close to the no-mitigation case. These results highlight both the scalability of rim-based reflector reconfiguration and the fundamental limitation when satellites cross the main lobe."}

Using a comprehensive global scan of Type-I and Type-II models -- incorporating all relevant theoretical requirements and collider constraints together with the stringent electron EDM (eEDM) bound -- we identify distinct phenomenological pathways to regions of large CP violation. In Type-I, we find that all viable parameter points predict a strict lower bound on the eEDM, $|d_e| > 10^{-31}\\,e\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}$, placing this scenario within definitive reach of next-generation EDM experiments; moreover, sizable CP violation in the gauge sector emerges only when the 125~GeV state is nearly degenerate with a second neutral Higgs boson. In contrast, Type-II suppresses gauge-sector CP violation but allows maximal CP mixing in the Yukawa sector of the heavy neutral scalars, exhibiting a strong correlation between large fermionic CP violation and the predicted eEDM. Finally, we uncover a phenomenon of ``hidden CP violation'' in the Higgs alignment limit: even as the heavy neutral scalars decouple from gauge bosons, their CP mixing remains entirely unconstrained and becomes increasingly maximal as the Yukawa-sector CP violation increases. We show that this hidden CP violation can be directly probed through the non-vanishing cubic interactions of the heavy neutral scalars to the charged Higgs and $W$ bosons."}

The initial stages of these events are characterized by highly anisotropic, nonthermal dynamics that precede hydrodynamization, yet they remain largely inaccessible through conventional soft observables. In this work, we show that the substructure of mid-rapidity jets provides direct sensitivity to the spacetime structure of this early, anisotropic phase. Using classical Yang-Mills simulations and effective kinetic theory to model the early-time evolution of the jet quenching parameter, we compute the azimuthally differential energy-energy correlator within the BDMPS-Z framework. By decomposing the result into celestial blocks, we isolate the coefficients that encode the anisotropic geometry and dynamics of the underlying medium. We identify an observable that couples directly to spatial anisotropies in the out-of-equilibrium QCD matter and also discuss the impact of medium response on its behavior. We further extend our study to mid-rapidity jets generated with the JEWEL Monte-Carlo, adjusted to incorporate an anisotropic medium background, and find qualitative agreement with the analytical expectations.

Naturally, such instrumental improvements open up possibilities for new and interesting scientific studies. We aim to show that the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in particular is bound to profit from these high-resolution measurements. This is because PWNe are the dominant Galactic source population at TeV energies, exhibit hard spectra up to hundreds of TeV and from X-ray observations are known to possess plentiful structure on arcminute scales. Using HESS J1813-178 and MSH 15-52 as examples, we create simple leptonic models of the TeV morphology of these sources based on X-ray observations and existing gamma-ray measurements. Then, assuming different models for the exposure and point spread function of the observatory, we create mock observations with the future CTAO southern array. We use these to assess the ability of these observations to differentiate between models and study the physics of these sources, in particular to infer the structure of the magnetic field and electron distributions. We find that future observations with the CTAO southern array at multi-TeV energies - in combination with existing X-ray measurements - will likely be able to constrain the distributions of magnetic field and high-energy electrons in these sources. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of these measurements can be significantly enhanced with the improved angular resolution achievable with novel reconstruction algorithms. However, we also show that in the relevant multi-TeV regime, signal-photon statistics remain a limitation and trading event statistics for improved angular resolution is not necessarily advantageous."}

However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical. We show that chiral gravitational waves can be generated in the presence of parity-violating terms in the potential."}

The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\\sim0.3-5\\times10^{23}\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($Γ\\approx 2.2\\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006.

Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a>0.99$.

Conformal prediction (CP) provides a simple, distribution-free framework for calibrating arbitrary predictive models without retraining, yielding rigorous uncertainty quantification with finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal exchangeability assumptions, without reliance on asymptotics, limit theorems, or Gaussian approximations. In this work, we investigate CP as a unifying calibration layer for machine-learning applications in high-energy physics. Using publicly available collider datasets and a diverse set of models, we show that a single conformal formalism can be applied across regression, binary and multi-class classification, anomaly detection, and generative modelling, converting raw model outputs into statistically valid prediction sets, typicality regions, and p-values with controlled false-positive rates. While conformal prediction does not improve raw model performance, it enforces honest uncertainty quantification and transparent error control. We argue that conformal calibration should be adopted as a standard component of machine-learning pipelines in collider physics, enabling reliable interpretation, robust comparisons, and principled statistical decisions in experimental and phenomenological analyses."}

The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories."}

A critical part of early detector commissioning is the study of detector characteristics and potential backgrounds, for which cosmic rays play a crucial role. In this article, we report that the number of cosmic rays detected with RNO-G's shallow antennas is consistent with expectations. We further verified the agreement in the observed cosmic-ray signal shape with expectations from simulations after careful treatment of the detector systematics. Finally, we find that the reconstructed arrival direction, energy, and polarization of the cosmic-ray candidates agrees with expectations. Throughout this study, we identified detector shortcomings that are mitigated going forward. Overall, the analysis presented here is an essential first step towards validating the detector and high-fidelity neutrino detection with RNO-G in the future."}

Astrophys., 667, 48, 2022) argued and made a compelling case that classical astronomical adaptive optics (AO) tomography performance can be further enhanced by carefully designing and optically configuring the system to leverage inherent super-resolution (SR) capabilities. Our goal here is to further materialise the concept by providing the means to compute SR-enabling tomographic reconstructors for AO and showcase its broad uptake on soon every 10 m-class VIS/NIR telescopes and Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes of up to 40 m in diameter. To that end we indicate the necessary tomography generalisations where we: (i) clarify how model-and-deploy is a generic methodological umbrella for linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) tomographic reconstructors arising naturally from the solution of the tomographic inverse problem, thus unifying various solutions presented as distinct in the literature within a single framework, (ii) recall how such solutions are found as limiting cases of a model-based optimal control problem, thus elucidating how pseudo-open-loop control is a feature of the latter that allows LMMSE reconstructors to be adapted to closed-loop systems, (iii) review the two forms of the LMMSE tomographic reconstructors, highlighting the necessary adaptations to accommodate super-resolution, (iv) review the implementation in either dense-format vector-matrix-multiplication or sparse iterative forms and (v) discuss the implications for runtime and off-line real-time implementations, anticipating widespread adoption. We illustrate our examples with physical-optics numerical simulations for 10 m and 40 m-scale systems showing the performance benefits of super-resolution in the order of several tens of nm rms and the computational burden associated."}

A relevant background to the astrophysical flux is prompt atmospheric neutrinos, originating from the decay of charmed mesons produced in cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production rate of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and consequently, the prompt neutrino flux, remains uncertain and has not yet been observed by neutrino detectors. An accurate measurement of this flux would enhance our understanding of fundamental particle physics such as hadronic interactions in high-energy cosmic-ray-induced air showers and the nucleon structure. Furthermore, an experimental characterization of this background flux will improve the precision of astrophysical neutrino flux spectral measurements. In this work, we perform a combined fit of cascade-like and track-like neutrino events in IceCube to constrain the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux. Given that the prompt flux is a sub-dominant contribution, treating systematic uncertainties arising from the potential mis-modeling of the conventional and astrophysical neutrino fluxes is critical for its measurement. Our analysis yields a non-zero best-fit result, which is, however, consistent with the null hypothesis of no prompt flux within one standard deviation. Consequently, we establish an upper bound on the flux at $4\\times 10^{-16}$ (GeV m$^2$ s sr)$^{-1}$ at 10 TeV."}

Submitted to Springer Nature's Experimental Astronomy", "summary": "Super-resolution (SR) refers to a combination of optical design and signal processing techniques jointly employed to obtain reconstructed wave-fronts at a higher-resolution from multiple low-resolution samples, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of the latter. After compelling examples have been provided on multi-Shack-Hartman (SH) wave-front sensor (WFS) adaptive optics systems performing atmospheric tomography with laser guide star probes, we broaden the SR concept to pyramid sensors (PyWFS) with a single sensor and a natural guide star. We revisit the analytic PyWFS diffraction model to claim two aspects: i) that we can reconstruct spatial frequencies beyond the natural Shannon-Nyquist frequency imposed by the detector pixel size and/or ii) that the PyWFS can be used to measure amplitude aberrations (at the origin of scintillation). SR offers the possibility to control a higher actuator density deformable mirror from seemingly fewer samples, the quantification of which is one of the goals of this paper. A super-resolved PyWFS is more resilient to mis-registration, lifts alignment requirements and improves performance (against aliasing and other spurious modes AO systems are poorly sensitive to) with only a factor up to 2 increased real-time computational burden."}

To evade laboratory and cosmological constraints on kinetic mixing with the Standard Model $U(1)_Y$, we assign a $Z_2$-odd dark parity to $X$ that forbids such mixing. The leading interactions then arise from gauge-invariant dimension-6 Higgs-portal operators, including both parity-even and parity-odd terms. We assume that the dark matter mass is generated via the Stueckelberg mechanism, which also induces a dimension-4 Higgs-portal operator $(H^\\dagger H) X_μX^μ$ and additional dimension-6 operators. We investigate freeze-in production of $X$ from Higgs-pair annihilations after reheating, incorporating both gauge-invariant and Stueckelberg-induced operators. First, we consider the case in which the Wilson coefficients of the gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators, $C$ and $\\tilde{C}$, are of order unity. We find that, in this case, the Stueckelberg contributions remain subdominant in dark matter production. This result follows from the requirement that the effective scale implied by perturbative unitarity must exceed the cutoff scale of the effective field theory. Next, we explore a more general situation in which $C$ and $\\tilde{C}$ are smaller than unity. In this second case, Stueckelberg-induced operators can become comparable and lead to distinctive features in the dark-matter parameter space, including interference effects. For both cases, we show that there exists a wide parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density."}

A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin."}

This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$>$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $μ$Jy\\,beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid."}

Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole."}

In this paper, in the format of space-based GW detectors, we establish an analytical framework to systematically search for the coupling of various noises from the heterodyne and modulation frequency bands, which are relatively unexplored so far. In addition to the noise caused by the phase modulation, the high-frequency laser phase noise is also discussed in the same framework. The analytical result is also compared with a numerical experiment to confirm that our framework successfully captures the major noise couplings.

Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123."}

Using the near-horizon Rindler correspondence, we derive analytic expressions for the logarithmic negativity and mutual information and examine their dependence on detector position, frequency, and Lorentz-violation parameters. Despite sharing the same metric, the two Lorentz-violating vacua become distinguishable near the horizon, particularly at low frequencies. We analyze the excitation of a freely falling two-level atom coupled to quantum fields near the horizon. The associated acceleration-radiation transition probabilities are computed explicitly. The resulting atomic response is locally indistinguishable from that in flat spacetime, confirming the validity of the equivalence principle even in the presence of Lorentz-violating corrections. Finally, we extend the notion of horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy to the bumblebee black hole and derive the corresponding entropy production rate induced by infalling atoms."}

Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter."}

By deriving a universal, ensemble-independent criterion for $\\mathrm{d}r_{\\rm c}/\\mathrm{d}r_h$ and applying it to the $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black hole, we reveal a sharp dichotomy: while $r_{\\rm c}(r_h)$ exhibits strictly monotonicity along isobars, it typically becomes non-monotonic along isotherms (except for the photon sphere of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole)--a behavior that has been overlooked in previous studies. Nevertheless, we rigorously prove that within the phase-transition region itself, the monotonicity of $r_{\\rm c}(r_h)$ is preserved. However, the generalizability of this result to other spacetimes requires case-by-case verification, and its validity could have notable implications for the observability of the jump in $r_{\\rm c}$.

Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures.

The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom."}

A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic interacting fermion-scalar theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism.

We show theoretically that a coherent deviation of the corresponding quantum field from its usual vacuum expectation value on the freeze-out hypersurface of a heavy-ion collision leads, after resonance decays, to a characteristic contribution to the transverse momentum spectrum of charged pions, in the very soft regime, consistent with experimental data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider.

A popular method of choice is the higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, mostly applied to nonrotating BHs. While previous studies demonstrated that the higher-order WKB method can also be used for Kerr BHs in GR, there has been little work on rotating BHs in modified theories of gravity. In this work, we revive the idea by extending WKB calculations of the Kerr QNM spectrum to higher order and assessing its accuracy against continued-fraction tabulated data. We then apply the WKB approximation beyond GR, comparing it against both linearized and continued fraction calculations in the parametrized beyond-Teukolsky formalism and in higher-derivative gravity (HDG) theories. We find that the frequencies computed by the WKB method in theories beyond GR have better accuracy than the measurement errors for GW250114, the event with the highest ringdown signal-to-noise ratio observed to date."}

The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy."}

The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories."}

While lattice QCD and experimental measurements provide valuable insights, a unified holographic framework capable of simultaneously describing these diverse observables and connecting them to measurable scattering processes is still lacking. Here, we employ the soft wall model, a holographic approach that incorporates gluon condensation and linear confinement, to systematically compute the proton mass spectrum, electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs), and gravitational form factors (GFFs). Our results show good agreement with recent experimental data and lattice QCD calculations. We further derive the corresponding proton radii and mechanical properties, such as pressure and shear force distributions. Finally, using the obtained GFFs as input, we calculate the cross-section for the photoproduction process $γp\\rightarrow J/ψp$.

This revisited horizon entropy is constructed directly from the modified Friedmann equations in a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The resulting entropy relation contains, beside the standard Bekenstein-Hawking term, an additional integral contribution that encodes the effective energy density and pressure generated by deviations from general relativity. Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift. The analysis demonstrates that including the integral term in the revisited entropy can relatively improve the late-time validity of the GSL for some of these models while living others unchanged, thereby reinforcing the profound connection between thermodynamics and gravity."}

Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123."}

Results for three photons or three jets have only been obtained using the leading-color approximation of the virtual two-loop amplitudes. In the meantime, the required amplitudes have become available without recourse to the color expansion. In the present publication, we quantify the effects of the subleading-color contributions, and show that they do not exceed 2\\% for most of the previously published results. The one exception is the ratio of three- to two-jet cross sections, where subleading-color effects can reach up to 5\\%. Furthermore, we show that these conclusions hold for both popular infrared renormalization schemes, minimal subtraction and Catani's. The size of the effects is usually overshadowed by the size of the remaining uncertainty due to the truncation of the perturbation series. This is particularly important in the case of three-jet distributions that have already been used for the extraction of the strong-coupling constant at the very high energies available at the LHC."}

We revisit the production of dark photons in the reactor environment and find that although the scattering of photons indeed leads to a larger number of produced dark photons, the overall enhancement is considerably smaller than what has been obtained in Ref. [PhysRevD.109.055041 (2024)]. Our findings are validated using GEANT simulations, which take into account oscillations between ordinary and visible photons and interaction of the latter with matter. The correction to the limit on mixing parameter between dark and visible photons is expected to be below 30% for all masses.

Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter."}

Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism."}

In our proposed scenario, baryogenesis happens in three steps: (1) The decay of the scalar produces an asymmetry between the two Higgs doublets which is partly transferred to fermions via Standard Model processes. (2) This asymmetry is converted into a $B-L$ charge via interactions mediated by the Majorana fermion. (3) The weak sphaleron processes partially convert the resulting $B-L$ charge into a $B$ asymmetry. We perform a numerical analysis of baryogenesis and the EDM contributions and find that, due to resonant enhancement, baryogenesis is possible with singlet masses as low as $10^5$ GeV. We also find that for some parameters, the model can give large contributions to the electron and neutron EDM while also producing baryogenesis. The present scenario offers a new perspective on interpreting observational bounds in terms of cosmology: Because it relies on out-of-equilibrium decays, the questions of baryogenesis and $CP$ violation in the Higgs sector may be linked with EDM signals without the additional assumption of a first order electroweak phase transition."}

Lensed images of the emission region, often referred to as photon rings in this context, are a direct consequence of the unstable dynamics of null geodesics near the spherical photon orbit in the Kerr spacetime. The order of the lensed image can be characterized by the number of half-orbits the photons complete before reaching the observer, with higher-order photon rings produced by null geodesics that circle the black hole more times. However, low-order rings are significantly influenced by the astrophysical environment. Measuring the Lyapunov exponent requires probing the exponentially small differences between successive photon rings or between photon rings and the shadow. We investigate potential astrophysical sources of systematic error the estimation of Lyapunov exponent, including the location of the observed emission, and especially at low photon ring order. We show that it is nevertheless possible to measure this purely gravitational quantity to roughly 10% and 1% systematic uncertainty by resolving the n=2 and n=3 photon rings with the shadow size, respectively. Therefore, the forthcoming black hole imaging efforts to capture, even if indirectly, the n=2 photon ring can result in a measurement of the Lyapunov exponent that is not limited by astrophysical uncertainties."}

A generic feature of leptogenesis is a large separation of scales between the epoch of baryon asymmetry production (sphaleron freeze-out at temperature $T \\sim 130$ GeV) and the one where it affects the big bang nucleosynthesis processes (BBN at $T \\sim 1$ MeV). Any entropy release between these two epochs would lead to a dilution of previously produced relics, such as the baryons. Motivated by the recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range, we consider the case of supercooled first-order phase transition and we study the impact of the induced entropy dilution on the leptogenesis parameter space. We employ the Type-I seesaw with 2 right-handed neutrinos as benchmark scenario, and demonstrate that the viable leptogenesis parameter space is significantly reduced. Interestingly, the values of dilution predicted by the SGWB best fit points in several first order phase transition scenarios would completely exclude the leptogenesis parameter space testable by future experiments, thus establishing a phenomenological interconnection between leptogenesis, SGWB, first order phase transition and neutrino mass generation. Our analysis can be generalised to different leptogenesis models and entropy dilution mechanisms."}

White paper submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call on behalf of ET OSB Div3", "summary": "Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \\simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\\sim 10^3 M_\\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \\gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation."}

By making use of model-independent reconstruction efficiencies provided by the ATLAS collaboration in their search for displaced vertices with multiple jets, we obtain constraints on this model from $139$ fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by ATLAS during the LHC Run~2, and assess the discovery reach of Run~3 and of the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).

IceCube has also measured the atmospheric muon neutrino flux at high energy. However, since this flux is dominated by astrophysical neutrinos, only an upper bound can be placed on the prompt atmospheric $ν_μ+\\barν_μ$ contribution. In this work, we provide a new evaluation of the prompt atmospheric muon flux including an intrinsic charm component in the cosmic ray-air interactions. The latter enhances the forward production of $\\bar{D}^0$, $D^-$, and $Λ_c$, which subsequently decay into final states containing muons and muon neutrinos. We show how the increase in the prompt muon flux due to intrinsic charm is accompanied by a corresponding enhancement in the prompt muon neutrino flux. We implement different intrinsic charm production models in MCEq to calculate the resulting lepton fluxes. We discuss the challenges of achieving predictions that are simultaneously consistent with both IceCube's high-energy atmospheric muon flux measurements and IceCube upper bound on the prompt muon neutrino flux, and we quantify the resulting discrepancies. As possible solutions, we explore scaling of the unflavored meson contributions to the prompt atmospheric muon flux to assess how such adjustments can reconcile these differences. The tensions emphasized in our work call for a refinement of the hadronic interaction models, especially the production of unflavored mesons, and for new experimental data sensitive to unflavored meson and heavy flavor production with reliable estimates of the associated uncertainties. We suggest that the energy and zenith angle dependence of muon and neutrino flux ratios from future neutrino telescope measurements may help to disentangle different scenarios."}

The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope."}
