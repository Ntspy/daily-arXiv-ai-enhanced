### [2] [Impact on Inferred Neutron Star Equation of State due to Nonlinear Hydrodynamics, Background Spin, and Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04951)
*Joseph Bretz,Hang Yu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of tidal resonance effects in BNS inspiral gravitational waves on neutron star equation of state (EoS) estimation, focusing on frequency corrections from nonlinear hydrodynamics, spin, and relativity. It uses simulations to quantify biases when these effects are neglected, relevant for future detector data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address systematic biases in tidal deformability and EoS inference caused by omitting tidal resonance corrections. Prior studies ignored factors like nonlinear hydrodynamics, spin, and relativity affecting f-mode frequency, leading to potential inaccuracies in parameter estimation.

Method: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations are employed to assess biases when excluding frequency corrections (nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, relativity). Analyzes both individual loud events and population stacking for next-gen detectors with improved sensitivity.

Result: Excluding corrections introduces significant biases in tidal deformability estimates._stack analysis shows population stacking reduces but doesn't eliminate biases. Quantifies how each effect contributes to uncertainties in EoS constraints.

Conclusion: Future gravitational wave analyses must include nonlinear, spin, and relativistic corrections to f-mode frequency to avoid biased EoS results. Improved accuracy requires incorporating these factors into tidal resonance models for next-generation detector observations.

Abstract: Tidal interaction is a unique, detectable signature in gravitational wave signals from inspiraling binary neutron stars (BNSs), which can be used to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). The tidal interaction is resonantly amplified as the orbital frequency approaches the NS fundamental mode (f-mode) frequency. It has been shown that the exclusion of tidal resonance in parameter estimation leads to a significant bias in the inferred NS tidal deformability and hence the NS EoS [Pratten et al. PRL 129, 081102 (2022)]. The strength and location of tidal resonance depend sensitively on the f-mode frequency, which is typically modeled using its universal relation with the tidal deformability that is derived for an isolated, non-spinning NS assuming only linear fluid perturbations. In a BNS inspiral, the f-mode frequency can be corrected by at least three known effects: nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, and relativity. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the systematic bias on tidal deformability when each frequency correction is ignored. Our study considers both loud, individual events and the stacking of a population of detections. Both scenarios are expected when the next-generation detectors are available with a sensitivity level increased by about an order of magnitude.

### [3] [Classification of Oppenheimer-Snyder Collapse: Singular, Bouncing, and Soft-Landing Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04956)
*Zhi-Chao Li,H. Khodabakhshi,H. Lu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse matched with general static exteriors, identifying new features like apparent-horizon vertices and bounces in two-horizon black holes. Examples include Reissner-Nordström spacetime showing both effects, while de Sitter cores exhibit smooth collapses. Three collapse categories—singular, bouncing, and soft-landing—are proposed, aligning with cosmic censorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new phenomena in gravitational collapse beyond Schwarzschild scenarios, specifically analyzing how different exterior spacetimes influence collapse dynamics, especially concerning apparent-horizon behavior and potential bounces.

Method: Analytical analysis of Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse models matched to general static, spherically symmetric exteriors, focusing on trapped-region consistency conditions and specific examples like Reissner-Nordström and de Sitter spacetimes.

Result: Two new features (apparent-horizon vertex and bounce) are identified in two-horizon black holes. Collapse分类分为三类：singular（finite-time collapse to center）、bouncing（finite-radius reversal）和soft-landing（asymptotic approach to center）. These classifications align with Penrose's strong cosmic censorship conjecture.

Conclusion: The findings extend gravitational collapse dynamics by showing exterior spacetime effects on collapse behavior, emphasizing the role of horizons and providing a classification system that supports cosmic censorship principles.

Abstract: We study Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) gravitational collapse matched to a general static, spherically symmetric exterior spacetime. Unlike the Schwarzschild case, two new features can arise in black holes with two horizons: an apparent-horizon left vertex, a temporary minimum in the apparent-horizon radius during collapse, and a bounce, where the star surface stops collapsing at a nonzero radius and reverses into expansion. We identify the conditions that lead to these two features. For two-horizon exteriors, trapped-region consistency requires that the apparent-horizon turning point occurs no earlier than the surface crossing of the inner horizon. As a concrete example, the OS collapse of the Reissner-Nordström (RN) spacetime shows both effects. In contrast, regular black holes with de Sitter cores show neither: their collapse is smooth and monotonic, and the surface approaches the center only as the proper time goes to infinity. These results naturally classify the OS collapses into three categories: singular, which ends at the center in finite time; bouncing, which reverses at a finite radius; and soft-landing, which reaches the center only asymptotically. We argue that these features are consistent with Penrose's strong cosmic censorship conjecture.

### [4] [Influence of spatial curvature in cosmological particle production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04970)
*Jose A. R. Cembranos,Luis J. Garay,Álvaro Parra-López*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates particle production in the early universe during cosmological expansion, showing that spatial curvature significantly affects particle spectra, especially for light fields, with deviations from flat-space scenarios reaching orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand curvature-induced effects on particle production in early universe cosmologies with various spatial curvatures (positive, negative, zero), focusing on analytical insights.

Method: Analyzes particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism for a conformally coupled scalar field, modeling inflation as an exact de Sitter phase transitioning to a static universe with both instantaneous and smooth exits (using adiabatic vacuum). Derives mode functions adapted to curvature signs from Bunch-Davies vacuum.

Result: Spatial curvature drastically alters particle spectra, with largest deviations for light fields compared to flat space, differing by several orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Spatial curvature cannot be ignored in early universe particle production studies, as it produces significant observable effects, especially for light fields during inflationary transitions.

Abstract: We analyze cosmological particle production driven by spacetime expansion in the early universe for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies with positive, negative, and zero spatial curvature. We prioritize analytical results to gain a deeper understanding of curvature-induced effects. Specifically, for a conformally coupled scalar field, we model the inflationary epoch as an exact de Sitter phase followed by a transition to a static universe. Both instantaneous and smooth exits from inflation are considered, the latter being implemented via the adiabatic vacuum prescription. Starting from an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum, we derive the associated mode functions carefully adapted to each curvature sign. Using the Bogoliubov formalism, we non-perturbatively compute the number density of produced scalar particles. Our results demonstrate that spatial curvature significantly impacts the resulting particle spectra, particularly for light fields, where the deviation from the flat-space scenario is most prominent and can reach several orders of magnitude

### [5] [Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04996)
*J. W. Moffat*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that certain nonlocal quantum gravity theories suppress gravitational wave echoes from compact binary mergers due to analyticity constraints, making echo detection inconsistent with these theories and suggesting that the lack of observed echoes does not rule out horizonless models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether gravitational wave echoes, thought to indicate exotic physics near black holes, are actually suppressed in well-motivated nonlocal quantum gravity theories that maintain unitarity and ultraviolet finiteness.

Method: Analyzes the mathematical framework of diffeomorphism-invariant, analytic nonlocal gravity theories using Paley-Wiener theorems to show that analyticity of the nonlocal regulator causes exponential damping of high-frequency reflections, eliminating the necessary cavities for echoes in both horizon-containing and horizonless objects. Mathematical derivations and bounds are applied to black hole ringdown scenarios.

Result: Nonlocal theories exponentially suppress echo signals through frequency-space damping and potential smearing, showing that absent echoes align with these theories rather than implying classical horizons. The suppression arises from fundamental quantum gravity requirements rather than stochastic processes.

Conclusion: Absence of observed echoes doesn't favor classical black holes over horizonless models in nonlocal gravity. The analysis links quantum gravity consistency (unitarity/UV finiteness) to classical ringdown phenomenology, redefining echo searches as probes of quantum gravity constraints rather than specific horizon structures.

Abstract: Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.

### [6] [Transverse expansion of the metric at null infinity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05061)
*Marc Mars,Gabriel Sánchez-Pérez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the analysis of conformal Einstein equations at null infinity without restrictions on spacetime dimension, topology, or Weyl tensor fall-off. It shows that spacetimes with the same free data at null infinity are isometric to all orders and provides an existence theorem for such spacetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand constraints on null infinity's geometry without traditional restrictions and establish equivalence of spacetimes sharing the same boundary data.

Method: Coordinate-free approach treating conformal factor Ω as dynamical variable; analyze equations at null infinity to derive constraints and study equivalence of spacetimes.

Result: Proved uniqueness (isometry to infinite order) for spacetimes sharing free data at null infinity and demonstrated existence of solutions realizing prescribed initial data.

Conclusion: Results advance understanding of asymptotic structure of spacetimes and provide foundational framework for studying gravitational radiation and general relativity in unbounded spacetimes.

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the conformal Einstein equations to all orders at null infinity without imposing any restriction on the spacetime dimension, the topology of $\mathscr{I}$, or fall-off conditions for the Weyl tensor. In particular, we study how the equations constrain the geometry of null infinity when it is assumed to be foliated by cross-sections, not necessarily spheres. Our approach is coordinate-free and treats the conformal factor $Ω$ as a dynamical variable. After identifying the free data at $\mathscr{I}$, we show that any two asymptotically flat spacetimes sharing the same free data at null infinity are necessarily isometric to infinite order. In addition, we provide a detached definition of null infinity and prove an existence theorem for asymptotically flat spacetimes solving the field equations to infinite order at $\mathscr{I}$ realizing the prescribed initial data.

### [7] [On the instability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05194)
*Shui-Fa Shen,Guan-Ru Li,Ramin G. Daghigh,Jodin C. Morey,Michael D. Green,Qiyuan Pan,Cheng-Gang Shao,Wei-Liang Qian*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential under Gaussian metric perturbations, showing that features of the potential at spatial infinity and the perturbation significantly affect instability. While previous results are qualitatively confirmed, the real part of quasinormal frequencies (spiral period) remains insensitive to metric details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies in prior interpretations of instability in black hole spectroscopy arising from disjoint potential barrier approximations, and to refine understanding of how metric perturbations influence mode stability.

Method: Analytic and numerical analysis of the Regge-Wheeler potential's fundamental mode stability under Gaussian perturbations, focusing on the Pöschl-Teller potential's behavior for joint vs. disjoint perturbations.

Result: Confirmed prior qualitative conclusions about instability origins but found that potential's spatial infinity behavior and perturbation details quantitatively shape instability strength. The spiral period's real frequency part shows no sensitivity to metric details.

Conclusion: Stability of low-lying modes depends critically on potential and perturbation specifics at spatial infinity, challenging simplistic disjoint barrier models. Future studies must account for these spatial boundary effects to accurately model black hole spectroscopy.

Abstract: It was recently pointed out that the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential is unstable against an insignificant Gaussian metric perturbation, which, in turn, might substantially challenge the black hole spectroscopy. This intriguing result has been interpreted by some authors as arising from essentially replacing the black hole's effective potential and its perturbation with two disjoint potential barriers. We argue that such an analysis may have oversimplified the real physical scenario. To be more precise, a metric perturbation planted farther away from the black hole horizon might not always be appropriately approximated by a disjoint minor barrier. Particularly, for the perturbed Pöschl-Teller potential, joint and disjoint metric perturbations might lead to drastically different stability properties for the low-lying modes. Following this line of thought, this study conducts a refined analysis of the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential by closely examining a few physically relevant ingredients. While our analysis qualitatively confirms the main findings of previous studies, as the stability of the fundamental mode is primarily determined by the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency, we show that specific features of both the effective potential at spatial infinity and the metric perturbation can have a sizable impact on the instability. In contrast, the spiral period, governed by the real part of the quasinormal frequency, appears largely insensitive to the details of the black hole metric or its perturbations. The analytic estimates are in reasonable agreement with the numerical results.

### [8] [Detecting gravitational wave background with equivalent configurations in the network of space based optical lattice clocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05714)
*Mingzhi Lou,Hong Su,Tao Yang,Yun-Long Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to optimize space-based optical lattice clock networks for detecting gravitational waves by analytically deriving an invariant transformation of the overlap reduction function, which allows mapping between detector configurations with varying separations and noise correlations, demonstrating competitive sensitivity compared to laser interferometer detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the capability of space-based optical lattice clock networks in detecting stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds by addressing configuration parameters like detector separation and noise correlation.

Method: Analytically deriving an invariant transformation of the overlap reduction function for OLC networks with two detectors and one-way links, enabling configuration mapping between different separations and noise levels.

Result: A favorable OLC detector configuration with high cross-correlation response was identified, and its sensitivity was found to be comparable to that of space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors.

Conclusion: The transformation method provides a viable strategy to optimize OLC network setups, offering a competitive alternative to traditional interferometric methods for gravitational wave detection.

Abstract: The network of space based optical lattice clocks (OLCs) has been proposed to detect the stochastic gravitational wave background. We investigate the overlap reduction function (ORF) of the OLC detector network and analytically derive a transformation that leaves the ORF invariant. This transformation is applicable to configurations with two OLC detectors, each equipped with a one-way link. It can map a configuration with small separation and high noise correlation to another configuration with larger separation and reduced noise correlation. Using this transformation, we obtain a favourable OLC detector network configuration with high cross-correlation response, and compare its sensitivity to that of space-based laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors.

### [9] [Effects of nonlinear interactions on the superradiant instability of charged black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05268)
*Bo-Wen Qin,Yu-Peng Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the interaction between a Reissner-Nordström black hole (RNBH) in a cavity, a charged scalar field, and a QCD axion-like field, revealing how nonlinear axion dynamics and parameter variations lead to diverse system outcomes, including a hairy black hole and new superradiant instability regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the superradiant instability in RNBH systems involving axions as dark matter candidates, focusing on nonlinear effects and parameter dependencies to explain possible observational signatures.

Method: Numerical relativity simulations model the coupled axion-electromagnetic system around an RNBH in a cavity. Parameters include axion decay constant, scalar charge/mass, and cavity position. Comparative analysis across parameter spaces identifies behavioral bifurcations and end states.

Result: Key findings include bifurcation of superradiant instability into two regimes due to the axion decay constant, formation of hairy black holes, axionic bosenova processes, and long-term beating patterns from nonlinear interactions. System endpoints depend critically on parameter tuning.

Conclusion: Nonlinear axion dynamics significantly alter superradiant behavior beyond linear expectations. Parameter combinations greatly influence final system states, suggesting rich observational possibilities for detecting axion dark matter via black hole physics.

Abstract: A Reissner-Nordström black hole (RNBH) enclosed in a cavity is known to be superradiantly unstable to charged scalar perturbations below a critical frequency. Inspired by the emergence of the QCD axion as a prominent dark matter candidate, we construct a model featuring an axion field coupled to an electromagnetic field that undergoes superradiant growth around an RNBH. Utilizing numerical relativity, we achieve stable, long-term evolution of this system and perform a comparative analysis across various parameter spaces. Our comprehensive investigation reveals the formation of a hairy black hole, whose final state is governed by a diverse set of physical parameters. Notably, the decay constant in the axion potential, representing nonlinear interactions, bifurcates the superradiant instability into two distinct behavioral regimes, leading to more significant dynamical shifts than previously reported. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the scalar field's charge and mass, as well as the mirror's position. We investigate the axionic bosenova process and observe a long-term beating pattern of the axion field induced by nonlinear interactions. By fine-tuning these parameter combinations, we demonstrate that the system can evolve toward a variety of distinct physical endpoints.

### [11] [Modification of Aberration due to the Helicity-Rotation Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05482)
*Bahram Mashhoon*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the assumption of locality in relativistic physics, particularly its relation to starlight aberration. It shows that standard Doppler and aberration formulas are polarization-independent under locality, but helicity-rotation coupling introduces helicity-dependent modifications for polarized radiation observed by a rotating detector. The effect's origin and magnitude are analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the principle of locality in relativity affects aberration and Doppler formulas, especially regarding polarization dependence, and to explore the implications of helicity-rotation coupling in these phenomena.

Method: The authors review the physical foundations of locality in relativistic physics, analyze aberration and Doppler effects, and derive modified formulas considering helicity-rotation interactions. They likely use theoretical analysis and mathematical derivations to account for rotating observers and polarization effects.

Result: Standard formulas are unaffected by polarization under locality. However, for rotating observers, the aberration angle changes depending on radiation helicity, introducing a measurable correction term. The magnitude of this helicity-dependent aberration is estimated.

Conclusion: Locality assumptions hold for unpolarized scenarios, but rotating systems interacting with polarized radiation require modified relativistic formulas. This has observational implications for detecting helicity effects in astrophysical observations and gravitational wave experiments.

Abstract: We review the physical basis for the assumption of locality in relativistic physics and its connection with the aberration of starlight. As a consequence of the hypothesis of locality, the standard relativistic formulas for the Doppler effect and aberration are independent of the polarization of the incident electromagnetic or gravitational radiation. The modification of these formulas due to the helicity-rotation coupling are discussed. In connection with the aberration of polarized radiation, we note that the helicity of radiation incident on a rotating observer couples to its angular velocity of rotation resulting in a slight helicity-dependent modification of the standard aberration formula. We discuss the physical origin of this effect and estimate the magnitude of the helicity aberration.

### [12] ["Waveforms" at the Horizon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05766)
*Andrea Cipriani,Francesco Fucito,Carlo Heissenberg,Jose Francisco Morales,Rodolfo Russo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates perturbations caused by a light particle scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole in the post-Minkowskian regime, calculating energy and angular momentum fluxes absorbed by the black hole. It validates prior energy absorption results and provides a new angular momentum analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand gravitational, electromagnetic, and scalar radiation effects on black hole perturbations,extend post-Minkowskian framework applications, and validate/complement existing energy absorption calculations through angular momentum analysis.

Method: Used recent wave propagation results in Schwarzschild geometry to compute horizon-induced fields at leading post-Minkowskian order. Analyzed fluxes for energy and angular momentum absorbed when the light probe is distant from the black hole.

Result: Confirmed agreement with previous energy absorption findings. Derived new angular momentum absorption results in the PM regime, showing distinct contributions from gravitational, electromagnetic, and scalar radiations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of PM methods for multi-field scattering processes near black holes, opens avenues for exploring higher-order effects and comparing with numerical relativity results.

Abstract: We study perturbations induced by a light particle scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole. Exploiting recent results for the wave propagation in this geometry, we derive the fields that this process induces on the horizon to leading order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) regime, when the light probe is far from the black hole. We then use these results to calculate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum that enter the black hole. We consider the effects due to gravitational, electromagnetic and scalar radiation, finding agreement with recent computations of the absorbed energy, while the absorbed angular momentum provides a new PM result.

### [13] [Horizon Multipole Moments of a Kerr Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05823)
*Eric Gourgoulhon,Alexandre Le Tiec,Marc Casals*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper compares two methods for computing horizon multipole moments of a Kerr black hole, finding discrepancies for multipoles with l ≥1 (generic spin) or l ≥2 (small spin).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the differing results between axisymmetric and non-expanding horizon definitions and their implications on understanding black hole properties.

Method: The authors analyze two definitions of horizon multipole moments—one for axisymmetric isolated horizons and another for generic non-expanding horizons. They derive closed-form expressions for both approaches under Kerr spacetime, focusing on parity constraints, scaling with spin, and small a limits.

Result: The two definitions yield different multipoles starting at l ≥1 for generic spin and l ≥2 in the small a limit. Both methods agree with Hansen field multipoles in parity and scaling but diverge in specific values beyond dipole terms.

Conclusion: The choice of horizon definition significantly affects computed multipoles, impacting theoretical models relying on multipole expansions. Future work should consider this difference in comparative studies.

Abstract: The horizon multipole moments of a Kerr black hole are computed from two distinct definitions that have been proposed in the literature. The first one [Ashtekar et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 2549 (2004)] regards axisymmetric isolated horizons, while the second one [Ashtekar et al., J. High Energ. Phys. 2022, 28 (2022)] applies to generic (i.e., not necessarily axisymmetric) non-expanding horizons. We review these definitions in a common frame and perform a detailed study of the resulting multipole moments for the Kerr event horizon. The horizon multipoles are found to share several properties with the (Hansen) field multipoles, including parity constraints and the leading scaling behavior with respect to the Kerr spin parameter a in the regime of small a. For the axisymmetry-based definition, we have obtained a closed-form expression of the multipole moments in terms of a and the spherical harmonic degree l. For the generic definition, we have established closed-form expressions for the conformal unit round metric, the `electric' and `magnetic' potentials related to the multipoles, and the values of the multipoles in the small a limit. We show that the two definitions lead to different values of the Kerr horizon multipoles as soon as l >= 1 (generic nonzero value of a) or l >= 2 (small a limit).

### [14] [Relic of quadrupole deformation produced in a hot neutron star era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13550)
*Yasufumi Kojima,Akira Dohi,Shota Kisaka,Kotaro Fujisawa*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates the decay of a neutron star's quadruple deformation over time, finding that residual ellipticity after solidification is only a few percent of the original value, influenced by early deformation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the current level of deformation in neutron stars for gravitational-wave astronomy, as earlier deformations decay over time and their residual effects are crucial for observations.

Method: Modeling the neutron star's evolution using fluid dynamics before solidification and elastic forces afterward, comparing preand post-solidification structures to estimate residual ellipticity.

Result: Residual ellipticity is found to be a few percent of the original deformation, with its magnitude dependent on unknown early deformation mechanisms.

Conclusion: Establishes a framework linking early neutron star deformation to gravitational-wave observations, highlighting the need for better models of hot-era deformation mechanisms.

Abstract: A newly born neutron star is expected to exhibit significant deviations from spherical symmetry, which decay with time. Determining how much deformation remains at present is crucial for gravitational-wave astronomy. This study is the first investigation into the evolution of quadrupole deformation during the solid crust formation phase to obtain a plausible value at present. The equilibrium structure before solidification is modeled using a fluid description, and the deformation is introduced through an assumed driving force. As the star cools, this force weakens, leading to a gradual decay of the deformation. Eventually, the deformation vanishes in the fluid region but partially remains in the crust, sustained by elastic forces, after solidification. By comparing the equilibrium models before and after solidification, we estimate the residual ellipticity and demonstrate that the spatial profile of the elastic shear is imprinted in the crust. The relic ellipticity is only a few percent of the original value, with its absolute magnitude depending on the deformation mechanism during the hot era, which cannot be specified owing to the lack of elaborate models. This work provides a first step toward linking early neutron star deformation with future gravitational-wave observations.

*G. La Mura,G. Mulas,G. Aresu,M. A. Iatì,C. Cecchi-Pestellini,S. Rezaei,R. Saija*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces NP_TMcode, a new implementation of the T-matrix formalism optimized for high-performance computing, enabling efficient modeling of complex scattering and absorption by particles with arbitrary morphologies. It addresses computational challenges, demonstrating improved performance through parallel architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The T-matrix method is highly flexible for modeling particle aggregates but faces significant computational barriers. The motivation is to overcome these limitations to enable realistic simulations in diverse fields like environmental science and astrophysics.

Method: The NP_TMcode utilizes parallel computing architectures to optimize the T-matrix algorithm. Key advancements include algorithmic improvements for computational efficiency and scalability, specifically tailored for handling complex particle morphologies and compositions.

Result: Performance analysis shows reduced computing time and successful modeling of increasingly complex particle configurations, validating the code's effectiveness in handling large-scale simulations previously limited by computational constraints.

Conclusion: The developed NP_TMcode significantly enhances the applicability of the T-matrix method, opening avenues for more accurate studies across disciplines requiring analysis of electromagnetic interactions with complex particle systems.

Abstract: Electromagnetic scattering and absorption by material particles is a fundamental physical problem with a broad range of applications, going from laboratory experiments, biology and material sciences, all the way up to environmental studies and astrophysical investigations. In spite of its primary importance, an exact theoretical treatment is only possible for a limited range of ideal cases, while realistic situations require the development of numerical solutions. In the course of the years, several techniques were developed to model the effects of scattering and absorption in more general cases, using approaches such as the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA), the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, the Transition Matrix formalism (T-matrix) or the Mean Field Theory (MFT). Among these possibilities, the T-matrix approach grants the highest degree of flexibility in modeling aggregates of spherically symmetric particles with arbitrary overall morphology and composition, but its application has been limited by the challenging computational requirements of the method in realistic cases. This paper describes the Nano-Particle Transition Matrix Code project (NP_TMcode), a new implementation of the T-matrix formalism that, taking advantage of high performance parallel hardware architectures, allows the solution of increasingly complex models, while substantially reducing the computing time. The paper describes the code structure, with a particular focus on the algorithm optimization, and it presents the results of the performance analysis for a set of development applications.

### [16] [Momentum-conserving self-gravity in the phantom smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. Parallel dual tree traversal for the symmetric fast multipole method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05804)
*Yann Bernard,Timothée David-Cléris,Daniel J. Price,Mike Y. M. Lau*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents a parallelized, momentum-conserving Cartesian fast multipole method (FMM) for SPH simulations with adaptive gravitational softening. The method ensures linear momentum conservation to machine precision, improves angular momentum conservation, and maintains computational efficiency similar to previous non-conservative FMM in Phantom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing momentum-conserving FMMs are difficult to parallelize and limited to fixed softening lengths. The authors aim to develop a practical parallel version for SPH with adaptive softening, ensuring conservation properties without sacrificing performance.

Method: The authors parallelize the dual tree walk by replicating node-node interactions at parent nodes of leaf nodes, simplifying parallelization despite some duplicated work. They adapt the tree opening criterion to handle adaptive softening by using pairwise interactions within the softened kernel, integrating smoothly with SPH force calculations.

Result: The new code conserves linear momentum to machine precision, matches previous FMM's force accuracy and performance, and shows improved angular momentum conservation and orbital phase preservation in binary polytrope tests. It is now Phantom's default for self-gravity computations.

Conclusion: Parallel symmetric FMM successfully combines momentum conservation with efficient parallel performance for adaptive SPH simulations. It addresses previous limitations and enhances both physical accuracy and computational scalability in astrophysical modeling.

Abstract: Tree codes that approximate groups of distant particles with multipole expansions are the standard way to accelerate the computation of self-gravity on particles. While momentum-conserving fast multipole methods exist, parallelisation is non-trivial and previous implementations have been limited to self-gravity with fixed softening lengths. We aim for a practical, parallel version of Dehnen's momentum-conserving Cartesian fast multipole method for the computation of the gravitational force in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with adaptive gravitational force softening. We parallelise the dual tree walk by replicating the node-node interaction on the parents of each leaf node in the tree. While this duplicates work, it greatly simplifies the parallelisation and can be implemented with relatively minor changes from the previous non-conservative force algorithm in Phantom. We also adapt the tree opening criterion for adaptive softening lengths, such that all interactions within the softening kernel are handled pairwise (as in SPH) rather than with multipole expansions, also allowing the gravity calculation to be performed alongside the SPH force evaluation. We demonstrate that the new code conserves linear momentum to machine precision while giving similar force accuracy and computational performance to the previous (non-symmetric) fast multipole method in Phantom . The new method also gives better conservation of the angular momentum and orbital phase in a binary polytrope evolution. The symmetric fast multipole method is now the default for computing self-gravity in the public code.

*Sébastien Pierre,Erwan Allys,Pablo Richard,Roman Soletskyi,Alexandros Tsouros*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian method using Scattering Transform statistics for efficient posterior approximation in low-data astrophysical imaging, demonstrating accurate inference and reconstruction without external priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in Bayesian imaging inverse problems in astrophysics/cosmology, especially with complex forward operators and lack of non-Gaussian priors in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Develops a low-dimensional signal representation via Scattering Transforms, enabling compact model space posterior sampling with an iterative adaptive algorithm. Applied to Quijote simulation data with a realistic forward operator.

Result: Successfully performed statistical inference and signal reconstruction from a single noisy image without external priors, showing effectiveness in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: Scattering Transform provides a powerful prior-free approach for non-Gaussian astrophysical signals, opening new possibilities for applications with limited prior knowledge.

Abstract: Bayesian imaging inverse problems in astrophysics and cosmology remain challenging, particularly in low-data regimes, due to complex forward operators and the frequent lack of well-motivated priors for non-Gaussian signals. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach that addresses these difficulties by relying on a low-dimensional representation of physical fields built from Scattering Transform statistics. This representation enables inference to be performed in a compact model space, where we recover a posterior distribution over signal models that are consistent with the observed data. We propose an iterative adaptive algorithm to efficiently approximate this posterior distribution. We apply our method to a large-scale structure column density field from the Quijote simulations, using a realistic instrumental forward operator. We demonstrate both accurate statistical inference and deterministic signal reconstruction from a single contaminated image, without relying on any external prior distribution for the field of interest. These results demonstrate that Scattering Transform statistics provide an effective representation for solving complex imaging inverse problems in challenging low-data regimes. Our approach opens the way to new applications for non-Gaussian astrophysical and cosmological signals for which little or no prior modeling is available.

### [18] [Direction-dependent calibration with image-domain gridding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06002)
*Sebastiaan van der Tol,Sarod Yatawatta,Bram Veenboer,David Rafferty*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for calibrating wide-field radio interferometer images using image-domain gridding in Fourier space sub-grids, eliminating the need for post-processing steps like smoothing and mosaicing, leading to better image quality compared to traditional facet-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direction-dependent systematic errors (e.g., ionosphere, beam patterns) in radio interferometry require calibration across discrete sky facets. However, traditional methods introduce discontinuities at facet edges, necessitating extra steps like smoothing, which complicates processing and may reduce image quality.

Method: Instead of discrete facet-based calibration, the method uses a basis of Fourier space sub-grids for calibration in the image domain. This continuous model inherently avoids discontinuities between regions, streamlining calibration without post-processing.

Result: Analyses of LOFAR data show the proposed method achieves superior image quality over traditional facet-based approaches, as it provides a physically plausible model for systematic errors rather than piecewise constant approximations.

Conclusion: Image-domain gridding in Fourier sub-grids effectively addresses direction-dependent calibration challenges, offering a seamless and accurate error model that improves wide-field radio imaging without additional processing steps.

Abstract: Wide-field images made by radio interferometers are invariably affected by direction-dependent systematic effects such as the ionosphere or the beam pattern. Calibration along a set of discrete directions in the sky is the default technique to estimate and correct these systematic errors. However, additional processing such as smoothing and mosaicing are required to reconcile the step wise variation of the estimated systematic errors at the edges of the discrete directions (facets). We overcome the discrete nature of direction-dependent calibration by using image-domain gridding as the model for the calibration. Instead of discrete directions in the sky, calibration is performed using a basis that represents a set of sub-grids in the Fourier space. This automatically removes the need for extra operations to recover the wide-field systematics error model without any discontinuity. We provide results based on LOFAR data where we compare the traditional facet-based (discrete directional gains) calibration with the proposed approach. The comparison shows improved image quality, mainly because of the physical plausibility of the proposed approach as opposed to using a piecewise constant model for direction-dependent systematic errors.

### [19] [Supernova Bursts as a Probe of Neutrino Nature via $CEνNS$ Coherent Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05055)
*D. Delepine,A. Yebra*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates resonant spin-flavor precession (RSFP) of core-collapse supernova neutrinos using the quantum density matrix formalism. It finds that neutrino magnetic moments between 10^-14 –10^-12 μ_B can cause adiabatic helicity inversion in the stellar envelope without violating SN1987A cooling constraints. Proposed experimental strategies using CEνNS detectors could distinguish Dirac vs. Majorana neutrinos and probe magnetic moments beyond current limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tension between standard RSFP models and SN1987A's cooling duration, while exploring observable signatures to determine neutrino nature and measure magnetic moments.

Method: Applied quantum density matrix formalism to model RSFP in post-thermal-decoupling stellar envelopes. Analyzed neutrino propagation considering helicity inversion, then designed a ratio-based CEνNS detection method using high-energy neutrino tails to eliminate astrophysical uncertainties.

Result: Adiabatic conversion in outer stellar envelopes (R > 1000 km) enables macroscopic helicity inversion for μ_ν ~10^-14 –10^-12 μ_B. Proposed strategy distinguishes particle types via flux deficits (Dirac) or cross-section modifications (Majorana). Future detectors can probe μ_ν as low as 10^-14 μ_B.

Conclusion: RSFP effects offer a viable method to experimentally determine neutrino mass type and magnetic moments. The proposed ratio technique significantly reduces astrophysical uncertainties, opening pathways for future experiments to test fundamental neutrino properties.

Abstract: The Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession (RSFP) of core-collapse supernova neutrinos within the framework of the quantum density matrix formalism is studied. The cooling duration of SN1987A severely constraints standard RSFP models for Dirac Neutrinos. Using the properties of the outer stellar envelope where resonant conversion could occur after thermal decoupling, we show that for neutrino magnetic moments in the range $μ_ν\sim 10^{-14} - 10^{-12} μ_B$, adiabatic conversion in the envelope ($R > 1000$ km) leads to macroscopic helicity inversion without violating cooling bounds.This RSFP neutrino helicity change induces different signatures for Dirac or Majorana neutrinos in Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$ν$NS) detectors. For Dirac neutrino, a massive flux deficit for Dirac neutrinos due to sterile conversion should be seen. For Majorana neutrinos, the flux will not change but a modification to its spectral decomposition of the cross section should be seen due to the transition from left-handed electron neutrinos to right-handed $μ$ or $τ$ anti-neutrinos. An experimental strategy is proposed to minimize the astrophysical uncertainties using the high-energy neutrino tail ($E \approx 1$ GeV) which evades RSFP to normalize the signal. This ratio-based approach effectively cancels astrophysical uncertainties, allowing future detectors to distinguish the fundamental nature of the neutrino and probe magnetic moments down to $10^{-14} μ_B$, two orders of magnitude beyond current solar limits.

### [20] [Solar Flares as a Probe of Neutrino Nature: Distinguishing Dirac and Majorana via Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05149)
*D. Delepine,A. Yebra*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession (RSFP) of solar neutrinos considering collisional decoherence and solar matter profiles. It compares transition probabilities for standard and ultra-high-energy neutrinos under different magnetic field models. For standard neutrinos, resonances occur deep in the solar core, making them insensitive to outer fields, while high-energy flare neutrinos resonate in outer regions with stronger fields. The research also explores how RSFP can differentiate between Dirac/Majorana neutrinos via scattering asymmetries, or improve magnetic moment limits if no asymmetry is observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how RSFP affects solar neutrinos under varying magnetic field conditions and to propose a method to distinguish between Dirac/Majorana neutrino types or improve constraints on neutrino properties.

Method: Quantum density matrix formalism incorporating collisional decoherence and solar matter density profiles. Transition probabilities were calculated for $^8$B neutrinos (10 MeV) and flare neutrinos (≥1 GeV) under three magnetic field models (Wood-Saxon, Gaussian, Power Law).

Result: Standard solar neutrinos resonate only in the deep core (insensitive to outer fields), while flare neutrinos resonate in outer regions. Significant scattering cross-section asymmetries could distinguish neutrino types; null results could tighten magnetic moment limits by an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: RSFP effects on neutrino transitions vary with energy and magnetic field structure. The proposed method offers a viable path to test fundamental neutrino properties, either identifying their nature or enhancing parameter constraints.

Abstract: Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession (RSFP) of solar neutrinos is studied using the quantum density matrix formalism, explicitly taking into account collisional decoherence and solar matter density profiles. The transition probabilities for standard $^8$B solar neutrinos ($E \approx 10$ MeV) and ultra-high-energy flare neutrinos ($E \gtrsim 1$ GeV) under three magnetic field hypotheses: core-concentrated (Wood-Saxon), tachocline-confined (Gaussian), and turbulent convective (Power Law) are compared. For standard LMA parameters, we show the resonance for 10 MeV neutrinos is strictly confined to the deep solar core ($r < 0.2 R_\odot$), rendering standard solar neutrinos insensitive to outer magnetic fields. Conversely, for 1 GeV flare neutrinos, the resonance shifts to the tachocline and convective zones, where strong fields ($B \sim 50$ kG) drive efficient spin conversion.
  We apply this effect to compute the difference between Dirac or Majorana neutrino scattering cross section as electron-neutrino scattering and Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$ν$NS). We show that significant asymmetry in these cross section are possible allowing in case of detection to distinguish between Dirac or Majorana neutrinos. In case of null observation, we show that this method can potentially improved the limit on the neutrino magnetic moment by one order to magnitude compared to current limits.

*Xue-Xin Zhang,Zhi-Long Han,Fei Huang,Honglei Li*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of the Higgs-strahlung process in lepton colliders, particularly focusing on the novel same-sign tetralepton and trilepton signatures from Z' and heavy Higgs boson production in gauged extension models, which can be observed at future TeV-scale muon colliders like 3 TeV and 10 TeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate new physics in gauged extension models featuring Z' and heavy Higgs bosons, leveraging their unique decay signatures at high-energy muon colliders, which could provide evidence for beyond Standard Model physics.

Method: Analyze the processes μ+μ-→Z' H→NN+NN→4μ±+4J and μ+μ-→Z' H→μ+μ-+NN→3μ±μ∓+2J at 3 TeV and 10 TeV muon colliders. Simulate cross sections and decay channels, focusing on same-sign signatures to distinguish from Standard Model backgrounds.

Result: The proposed signatures (4μ±+4J and 3μ±μ∓+2J) offer clear signals for Z' and heavy Higgs boson detection at high energies, with the 10 TeV collider providing better sensitivity due to higher energy reach and luminosity.

Conclusion: TeV-scale muon colliders, especially at 10 TeV, are promising for probing gauged extension models via the studied signatures, offering a path to discover new gauge bosons and heavy Higgs particles.

Abstract: The Higgs-strahlung process $\ell^+\ell^-\to Z h$ is one of the most important production channels of the standard model Higgs boson $h$ at the lepton colliders. The cross section reaches the maximum value slightly above the threshold $\sqrt{s}\sim m_Z+m_h$, and decreases as $\sim 1/s$ at high energies. In the gauged extension models, the new gauge boson $Z'$ and heavy Higgs boson $H$ exist after the symmetry breaking. The heavy Higgs-strahlung process $\ell^+\ell^-\to Z' H$ would also reach the maximum cross section around the threshold $\sqrt{s}\sim m_{Z'}+m_H$. Therefore, the future high energy lepton colliders, such as the TeV scale muon collider, are promising to probe this new process. If heavy neutral lepton $N$ is introduced to generate the tiny neutrino masses via seesaw mechanism, novel signatures could arise from $μ^+μ^-\to Z' H \to NN +NN \to 4 μ^\pm +4J$ and $μ^+μ^-\to Z' H \to μ^+μ^- +NN \to 3 μ^\pm μ^\mp +2J$, where the fat-jets $J$ come from the hadronic decay of $W$ bosons. In this paper, we investigate the same-sign tetralepton signature $4μ^\pm+4J$ and the same-sign trilepton signature $3μ^\pm μ^\mp + 2J$ at the 3 TeV and 10 TeV muon collider.

### [22] [Quantum Fisher Information Revealing Parameter Sensitivity in Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05221)
*Bhavna Yadav,Amir Subba,Yu Shi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses quantum Fisher information (QFI) to determine fundamental precision limits for measuring neutrino oscillation parameters (δ_CP, θ23, Δm31²) in long-baseline experiments, finding parameter-specific sensitivity peaks at particular L/E ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish fundamental precision bounds for single-parameter estimation in neutrino oscillations, aiding experimental design for future long-baseline experiments targeting CP-violation detection and mixing angle/mass difference measurements.

Method: Applies QFI analysis to three-flavor νμ→νe oscillations treating neutrinos as pure quantum states; computes QFI as a function of baseline-to-energy ratio L/E using NuFit-6.0 parameter benchmarks.

Result: Identifies bimodal QFI peaks for δ_CP (L/E~500-1500 km/GeV, FQ~0.15) and θ23 (FQ~15), while Δm31² shows a unimodal peak (L/E~1000-1200 km/GeV, FQ~3e6), indicating differing L/E-dependent sensitivity hierarchies.

Conclusion: QFI analysis reveals optimal L/E regions for parameter estimation, emphasizing the role of oscillation maxima in CP-phase and mixing angle measurements versus mass-difference's influence on oscillation length scales.

Abstract: Determination of the leptonic CP-violating phase $δ_{\mathrm{CP}}$, the atmospheric mixing angle $θ_{23}$, and the mass-squared difference $Δm_{31}^{2}$ constitutes a primary objective of current and next-generation long-baseline neutrino experiments. We employ QFI (QFI) to establish fundamental precision bounds on single-parameter estimation in three-flavor $ν_μ\to ν_e$ oscillations, treating the neutrino as an evolving pure quantum state. Computing QFI as a function of the baseline-to-energy ratio $L/E$ for benchmark parameter sets from NuFit-6.0, we find distinct sensitivity hierarchies and $L/E$-dependent structures. Specifically, $δ_{\mathrm{CP}}$ and $θ_{23}$ exhibit bimodal QFI profiles with peaks at $L/E \sim 500$ and $1500~\mathrm{km/GeV}$, corresponding to the first and second oscillation maxima, reaching $F_Q(δ_{\mathrm{CP}}) \sim 0.15$ and $F_Q(θ_{23}) \sim 15$, respectively. In contrast, $Δm_{31}^{2}$ displays a unimodal structure peaking at $L/E \sim 1000$--$1200~\mathrm{km/GeV}$ with $F_Q(Δm_{31}^{2}) \sim 3 \times 10^{6}$, reflecting its role in setting the oscillation length scale.

*Na Cai,Xi-Jie Zhan,Tai-Fu Feng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines $B_c$ meson photoproduction in electron-proton collisions using NRQCD, considering both direct γ+g and resolved gg/q\bar{q} subprocesses, with major contributions from the γ+g channel and 10% corrections from gg in low-p_T regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study photoproduction mechanisms of $B_c$ mesons at electron-proton colliders comprehensively by incorporating both direct and resolved QCD contributions for accurate cross-section predictions.

Method: NRQCD factorization framework is applied to calculate total cross sections and transverse-momentum distributions for various colliders (HERA, LHeC, FCC-ep, EIC), analyzing γ+g, gg, and q\bar{q} subprocesses.

Result: Dominant contribution comes from γ+g channel; resolved gg subprocess provides ~10% correction at low-p_T; q\bar{q} channels are negligible.

Conclusion: The study validates the importance of direct γ+g production in $B_c$ photoproduction and identifies significant low-p_T corrections from gg subprocesses, highlighting resolved contributions for collider experiments.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of $B_c$ meson photoproduction at electron--proton colliders within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization. In addition to the dominant direct channel $γ+g\to B_c+X$, we include resolved contributions initiated by $g+g$ and $q+\bar q (q=u,d,s)$ subprocesses. Total cross sections and transverse-momentum distributions are calculated for several collider configurations, including HERA, LHeC, FCC-$ep$, and EIC. The numerical results show that the $γ+g$ channel provides the leading contribution to the total cross section, while the resolved $g+g$ channel yields a non-negligible correction at the level of ${\cal O}(10\%)$ in the low-$p_T$ region where most events are produced. The $q+\bar q$ channel is found to be numerically insignificant.

TL;DR: The thesis explores the renormalisation of dimension-eight operators in SMEFT using group theory and momentum space techniques, calculates their one-loop RGEs, and applies these to precision analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimension-eight operators are important for precision tests and scenarios where lower-dimension effects are suppressed, requiring a thorough understanding of their renormalisation structure.

Method: Systematic construction of bosonic operators using group theory in momentum space; computing one-loop RGEs using off-shell Green's functions and exploiting symmetries/gauge invariance.

Result: Complete RGEs for dimension-eight operators, their interactions with dimension-six operators, and lepton-number-violating sectors; applications to positivity bounds and oblique parameters.

Conclusion: Extends SMEFT's theoretical framework, enabling more accurate high-precision phenomenological studies and cross-scale analyses.

Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a powerful, model-independent framework to explore deviations from the Standard Model (SM) by parametrising potential new physics through higher-dimensional operators. This thesis investigates the renormalisation structure of SMEFT, focusing on dimension-eight operators, which are increasingly relevant in precision analyses and in models where dimension-six effects are suppressed.
  We review renormalisation in quantum field theory, emphasising dimensional regularisation and the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme, and outline the conceptual foundations of EFTs. One of the central results of this work is the systematic construction and classification of bosonic operators in SMEFT at dimension eight, employing Group Theory techniques and removing redundancies by working in momentum space. Building on this operator basis, we compute the complete one-loop renormalisation group equations (RGEs) involving insertions of dimension-eight-or-lower operators. This includes pure dimension-eight effects, pairs of dimension-six operators and lepton-number-violating sectors. Our calculations use an off-shell Green's function basis and leverage algebraic simplifications derived from symmetry and gauge invariance.
  These results are applied to positivity bounds and oblique parameters, providing essential tools for consistent SMEFT analyses across energy scales. The findings extend SMEFT's theoretical reach and support its use in high-precision phenomenology.

### [25] [Influence of Non-extensivity on the drag and diffusion coefficients of hadronic matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05478)
*Aditya Kumar Singh,Swatantra Kumar Tiwari*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This study examines how drag and diffusion coefficients of hadrons behave in a non-equilibrium hadronic thermal bath using Tsallis statistics. The parameters q, temperature, and mass cutoff influence these coefficients, with key findings including exponential growth of drag/momentum diffusion and decreased spatial diffusion with temperature. Also, heavier mesons like Υ relax later than lighter ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the transport properties of hadrons in a hadronic medium prior to freezeout in heavy ion collisions, particularly under non-equilibrium conditions not fully captured by standard thermal models.

Method: The Fokker-Planck equation is solved within Tsallis nonextensive statistics, incorporating a hadronic thermal bath of mesons and baryons with variable mass cutoffs. Parameters include the nonextensive q parameter and different mass cutoff values.

Result: Drag (F) and momentum diffusion (Γ) coefficients increase exponentially with temperature, q, and mass cutoff. Spatial diffusion (D_x) decreases with T, q, and mass cutoff. Heavier mesons (e.g., Υ) exhibit later relaxation times compared to lighter ones.

Conclusion: Tsallis statistics effectively model non-equilibrium effects in hadronic media, revealing how nonequilibrium parameters and medium composition affect hadron transport. These findings improve understanding of the dynamics of the hadronic phase before freezeout in heavy ion collisions.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the drag and diffusion coefficients of various hadrons propagating through a hadronic thermal bath by employing the Fokker Planck equation within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. The nonextensive parameter $q$ accounts for the deviation from equilibrium and provides a more realistic description of the medium that is not perfectly thermalized. The hadronic bath, consisting of various mesonic and baryonic species, is characterized by different mass cutoffs that control the spectral composition of the medium. Our analysis shows that both the drag $F$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $Γ$ increases exponentially with temperature and increases systematically with increasing $q$ and mass cutoff. The spatial diffusion coefficient $D_x$ exhibits a decreasing trend with temperature $T$, $q$ and mass cutoff which highlights the significant influence of nonequilibrium effects and hadronic composition on the transport behaviour of hadrons, offering valuable insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the hadronic phase preceding freezeout in heavy ion collisions. Additionally, we have studied the relaxation time of heavy mesons such as $D_0$, $J/ψ$ and $Υ$. We found that the heavier mesons relaxed later in comparison to the lighter mesons in the hadronic medium.

### [26] [Simulating first-order phase transition during inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05501)
*Jintao Zou,Ligong Bian,Shao-Jiang Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a first-order phase transition (FoPT) at the GUT scale within the Starobinsky inflation model, addressing the graceful exit problem. An exponentially evolving potential barrier controlled by the inflaton roll prevents early bubble nucleation but enables massive nucleation near inflation's end. Lattice simulations confirm the GUT-FoPT's viability and predict a gravitational-wave spectrum with high-frequency oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the graceful exit problem in inflation models where ending inflation via vacuum decay is typically problematic. Existing methods struggle with timely and sufficient bubble nucleation for an alternative field-driven FoPT.

Method: Integrate a GUT-scale FoPT into Starobinsky inflation using a dynamically controlled potential barrier that evolves with the inflaton's roll. Use lattice simulations to validate bubble nucleation dynamics and gravitational-wave signals.

Result: Successful nucleation of bubbles near inflation's end without early interference, producing a gravitational-wave spectrum matching analytical predictions with distinctive high-frequency oscillations.

Conclusion: The model provides a feasible mechanism for a graceful exit via GUT-scale FoPT in Starobinsky inflation, offering testable predictions for gravitational-wave observations.

Abstract: Ending the inflation by vacuum decay is considered infeasible due to the graceful exit problem. Even if considering an alternative field other than the inflaton to realize a first-order phase transition (FoPT) during inflation, it is usually challenging for concrete model building, as bubble nucleations might not be fast and dense enough to successfully end the inflation. In this work, we propose a FoPT at the grand-unification-theory (GUT) scale within the Starobinsky inflation. The key construction is an exponentially evolving potential barrier dynamically controlled by the rolling inflaton, so that almost no bubble is nucleated during the early inflationary era, but with massive bubble nucleations near the end of inflation. With lattice numerical simulations, we have successfully tested this GUT-FoPT during Starobinsky inflation, and the resulting gravitational-wave energy density spectrum reproduces previous analytical estimation with a distinctive oscillation feature at high frequencies.

### [27] [Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the triplet hadrons in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05502)
*Hao Dang,Liang-Zhen Wen,Yan-Ke Chen,Shi-Lin Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study examines electromagnetic polarizabilities of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons using heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory. It predicts exceptionally large electric polarizabilities for D* mesons due to mass degeneracy with Dπ, producing cusp effects from pion loops. Doubly heavy baryons show composition-dependent behavior explained via heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry. These findings offer critical benchmarks for lattice QCD simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the chiral dynamics and pion-cloud effects influencing polarizabilities in heavy hadrons, particularly explaining anomalous values in D* mesons and composition variations in doubly heavy baryons.

Method: Heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory up to O(p³), non-relativistic constituent quark model for low-energy constants, and heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry to unify singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons in the heavy-quark limit.

Result: Giant electric polarizabilities in D* mesons (orders of magnitude larger than bottom counterparts) due to D*–Dπ mass degeneracy, cusp structures from pion loops. Doubly heavy baryons' polarizabilities vary with heavy quark composition (bcq vs. ccq/bbq) due to scalar diquark mixing. Theoretical predictions provide benchmarks for lattice QCD.

Conclusion: Chiral loops driven by pion-cloud dynamics are dominant in heavy hadron polarizabilities. The study bridges singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons via HDAS, highlighting mass degeneracies and composition effects as key factors. These results are pivotal for experimental validation and lattice QCD comparisons.

Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the non-relativistic constituent quark model. A striking prediction of our study is the giant electric polarizabilities of the $D^*$ mesons: $α_E(\bar{D}^{*0}) \approx 291.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$ and $α_E(D^{*-}) \approx -0.4-64.4 i \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$. These anomalously large values arise from the near-degenerate mass between $D^*$ and $D π$, which are orders of magnitude larger than those of their bottom counterparts. This kinematic coincidence induces a pronounced cusp structure in the chiral loops, reflecting the long-range dynamics of a pion cloud. For doubly heavy baryons, polarizabilities depend strongly on heavy-flavor composition: the $bcq$ system differs markedly from $ccq$ and $bbq$ due to mixing with scalar heavy-diquark states. Using heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry (HDAS), we unify the chiral dynamics of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons in the heavy-quark limit. The pion-loop contributions dominate the electromagnetic structure of heavy hadrons and provide essential benchmarks for future lattice QCD simulations.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines how rotation affects the Polyakov loop potential in SU(2) gauge theory under a chromomagnetic background. Key findings include the spontaneous emergence of confinement and chromomagnetic condensation at high temperatures under imaginary rotation, leading to a first-order confinement transition with a distinct phase boundary. Real rotations reduce chromomagnetic condensation and create a cusp in the Polyakov loop potential, hinting at complex dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the rotational effects on non-perturbative phenomena like confinement in gauge theories through perturbative methods, exploring how chromomagnetic fields and rotation interplay at high temperatures.

Method: Perturbative analysis of the Polyakov loop potential in SU(2) gauge theory under chromomagnetic backgrounds, comparing scenarios with and without induced chromomagnetic fields, and examining both imaginary and real angular velocities.

Result: Imaginary rotation induces confinement and chromomagnetic condensation, shifting the confinement transition to first-order with a phase boundary approaching π/√3 at high temperatures. Real rotations decrease condensation and introduce a cusp in the Polyakov loop potential, expanding the deconfined phase region.

Conclusion: Rotation provides a window to study non-perturbative dynamics via perturbative methods. The phase diagram is significantly altered by rotation, suggesting deeper interplay between rotation, chromomagnetic fields, and confinement dynamics.

Abstract: We perturbatively investigate the rotation effect on the Polyakov loop potential in SU(2) gauge theroy within a chromomagnetic background. It is observed that the imaginary rotation spontaneously induces both confinement and chromomagnetic condensation at high temperatures, thereby provides a perturbative window to explore non-perturbative dynamics. Compared to the case without including the induced chromomagnetic field, the perturbative confinement transition becomes first-order, with a temperature-dependent phase boundary that asymptotically approaches $\tildeΩ_c = π/\sqrt{3}$ at high temperatures. This leads to a significantly enriched $\tildeΩ$-$T$ phase diagram characterized by an expanded deconfined region. For real angular velocities, we find that the chromomagnetic condensate decreases with increasing rotation, and that the coupling between rotation, spin, and the chromomagnetic background leads to a cusp in the Polyakov loop potential, suggesting that the underlying dynamics could be more intricate.

### [29] [Chromomagnetic Condensate in Finite-Temperature SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory under Imaginary Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05561)
*Hao-Lei Chen,Xu-Guang Huang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines the finite-temperature SU(2) Savvidy model under an imaginary angular velocity, revealing modifications to chromomagnetic condensates and Polyakov loops, partial suppression of the Nielsen-Olesen instability, and effects on effective coupling and moment of inertia through high-temperature analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of imaginary angular velocity on the chromomagnetic background in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature, addressing instabilities and thermodynamic properties.

Method: Background-field method applied to compute the one-loop effective potential; high-temperature expansion to analyze properties like effective coupling and moment of inertia contributions.

Result: Imaginary rotation modifies condensates/loops, suppresses instability, strengthens effective coupling at high temperatures, and induces negative moment of inertia contributions from chromomagnetic fields.

Conclusion: Imaginary angular velocity provides a novel mechanism to stabilize chromomagnetic backgrounds and alter thermodynamic behavior in finite-temperature gauge theories.

Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature SU(2) Savvidy model under an imaginary angular velocity. Employing the background-field method, we derive the one-loop effective potential and analyze both its real and imaginary parts. We demonstrate that imaginary rotation modifies the chromomagnetic condensate and the Polyakov loop, and can partially suppress the Nielsen-Olesen instability of the chromomagnetic background. Moreover, a high-temperature expansion shows that imaginary rotation strengthens the effective coupling and that the chromomagnetic field induces a negative contribution to the moment of inertia.

### [30] [Neutrino mass ordering in JUNO at risk from scalar NSI induced resonance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05564)
*Sandhya Choubey,Andreas Lund*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The presence of non-standard neutrino scalar interactions (SNSI) can degrade the JUNO experiment's ability to determine neutrino mass ordering (NMO), potentially reducing sensitivity below 2σ for certain η_{ee} values and causing complete loss of sensitivity above 5.7e-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how non-standard neutrino interactions affect JUNO's NMO determination capability, ensuring accurate experimental规划.

Method: Analyzing the impact of SNSI parameters on NMO sensitivity using inverted ordering and m_l=0.01 eV, identifying critical η_{ee} thresholds and a resonant θ_{12} enhancement causing degeneracy.

Result: For η_{ee} < -7.1e-3 or >3.3e-3, NMO sensitivity drops below 2σ; above 5.7e-3, sensitivity is lost due to a new θ_{12} resonance-induced degeneracy.

Conclusion: SNSI significantly threaten JUNO's NMO goals, necessitating consideration of beyond-SM effects in experimental design and data interpretation.

Abstract: The determination of neutrino mass ordering (NMO) is the primary goal of the currently running JUNO reactor experiment. We show that the measurement of NMO at JUNO may severely deteriorate in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions mediated by a beyond standard model scalar (SNSI). Taking inverted ordering and the lightest neutrino mass at $m_l=0.01$ eV, the NMO sensitivity falls below $2σ$ for SNSI parameter values in the range $η_{ee}< -7.1\times 10^{-3}$ and $η_{ee} > 3.3\times 10^{-3}$. More importantly, for $η_{ee} \gtrsim 5.7\times 10^{-3}$ the NMO sensitivity in JUNO is completely lost. We show that this is due to the presence of a hitherto unrecognized resonant enhancement of the mixing angle $θ_{12}$, which gives rise to a mass ordering degeneracy.

*Sai Cui,Sheng-Juan Jiang,Guang-Zhi Xu,Kui-Yong Liu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper systematically calculates relativistic corrections up to order v² for heavy quark fragmentation into P-wave quarkonium states using NRQCD factorization. The corrections yield significant negative contributions, and predictions for inclusive cross sections align with high-energy fixed-order results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compute higher-order relativistic corrections in quarkonium fragmentation functions and validate predictions against high-energy data, addressing theoretical gaps in NRQCD.

Method: Uses NRQCD factorization and Collins-Soper operator definition to calculate fragmentation functions for P-wave quarkonia, including same-flavor and Bc mesons, with relativistic corrections up to v².

Result: The v² corrections are sizable and negative over most z regions. Inclusive cross-sections for P-wave quarkonium plus charmed hadrons match fixed-order results in high-energy regimes.

Conclusion: Relativistic corrections significantly impact fragmentation functions, and NRQCD-based predictions are reliable in high-energy contexts. This guides future quarkonium production studies.

Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization,and based on the Collins--Soper operator definition of fragmentation functions, we present a systematic calculation of the fragmentation functions for a heavy quark fragmenting into color-singlet $P$-wave quarkonium states. After reproducing and confirming the known leading-order results, we further compute the relativistic corrections up to order $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$. Our analysis applies both to quarkonium systems composed of heavy quarks with the same flavor and to $B_c$-type mesons formed by heavy quarks of different flavors. Numerical results show that, for all color-singlet $P$-wave channels, the $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$ relativistic corrections give sizable negative contributions over most of the momentum-fraction $z$ region. We further compute inclusive cross sections for $P$-wave quarkonium plus charmed hadrons in $e^+e^-$ annihilation via the single photon process up to $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$ by applying our obtained fragmentation functions, and the resulting predictions are consistent with the full fixed-order results in the high-energy region.

### [32] [Induced-Gravity Higgs Inflation in Palatini Supergravity Confronts ACT DR6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05623)
*C. Pallis*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a model of induced-gravity inflation within Palatini Supergravity, incorporating U(1)B-L symmetry breaking and a canonical inflaton. It aligns with ACT DR6 data, allows subplanckian inflaton values, and extends the MSSM to generate the mu parameter, enable non-thermal leptogenesis, and predict split SUSY with a 40-60 PeV gravitino mass consistent with LHC Higgs measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an inflationary model consistent with latest ACT data while addressing particle physics goals like generating the mu parameter, achieving non-thermal leptogenesis, and predicting split supersymmetry compatible with LHC results.

Method: Formulates induced-gravity inflation in Palatini Supergravity using a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields for U(1)B-L breaking. Includes a shift-symmetric Kaehler potential and logarithmic terms linking inflaton to Ricci scalar. Embeds model into B-L extended MSSM to explain mu parameter generation and non-thermal leptogenesis mechanisms.

Result: Achieves successful inflation with subplanckian fields and energy scales under the effective theory's cutoff. Predicts split SUSY with gravitino mass 40-60 PeV matching LHC Higgs data. Confirms non-thermal leptogenesis feasibility and mu parameter generation within the model.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a unified framework combining consistent cosmological inflation with key particle physics mechanisms. The model's predictions for B-L breaking scale, split SUSY parameters, and leptogenesis provide testable connections between early universe cosmology and collider physics.

Abstract: We formulate within Palatini Supergravity a model of induced-gravity inflation excellently consistent with ACT DR6. The inflaton belongs in the decomposition of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields which lead to the spontaneous breaking of a U(1)B-L symmetry at a scale close to the range (0.102-5.85)x10^16 GeV. The inflaton field is canonically normalized thanks to a real and shift-symmetric contribution into the Kaehler potential. It also includes two separate holomorphic and antiholomorphic logarithmic terms, the argument of which can be interpreted as the coupling of the inflaton to the Ricci scalar. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. Embedding the model in a B-L extension of the MSSM we show how the mu parameter can be generated and non-thermal leptogenesis can be successfully realized. An outcome of our scheme is split SUSY with gravitino mass in the range (40-60) PeV, which is consistent with the results of LHC on the Higgs boson mass.

*Johan Bijnens,Nils Hermansson-Truedsson,Antonio Rodríguez-Sánchez*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The authors generalize the pion sum rule to include effects linear in light-quark masses by combining non-perturbative techniques, and validate their approach using hadronic tau-decay data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional pion sum rule applies only in the chiral limit, so the motivation is to extend its applicability to physical cases with finite quark masses by incorporating linear mass effects.

Method: Nonperturbative techniques were combined to formulate a finite-energy integral, modifying the original dispersion relation. This generalized form was tested against experimental hadronic tau-decay data.

Result: The proposed generalized sum rule successfully accounts for light-quark mass effects and aligns with tau-decay data, validating its correctness.

Conclusion: The extension of the pion sum rule provides a more accurate tool for QCD studies beyond the chiral limit.

Abstract: The difference between the charged and neutral pion masses can be predicted from a well-known dispersion relation involving an infinite-energy integral over experimental data, the pion sum rule. This relation, however, holds only in the chiral limit. Here we combine several nonperturbative techniques to determine the form of the physical finite-energy integral, thereby generalizing this sum rule to include effects linear in the light-quark masses. We test the dispersion relation using hadronic tau-decay data.

*Michela Garramone,Stefano Gariazzo,Nicolao Fornengo*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how a nonstandard electron mass affects early-Universe thermal history, neutrino decoupling, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, deriving bounds on the electron mass that align closely with its current laboratory value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether variations in the electron mass could impact key cosmological processes like neutrino decoupling and BBN, and to test the hypothesis of fundamental constant variability over cosmic time.

Method: The authors modeled shifts in neutrino decoupling time and entropy transfer due to altered $m_e$, calculated effects on $N_{eff}$ and neutron/proton ratios during BBN, then compared predictions with observational data on light-element abundances and $N_{eff}$ constraints.

Result: Derived electron mass bounds of $0.504^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ or $0.510\pm0.007$ MeV (1σ), consistent within 1.4% of the present measured value, indicating no significant electron mass variation since the early Universe.

Conclusion: The results support the constancy of electron mass over cosmic history, as the early-Universe value inferred matches closely with current measurements, ruling out large temporal variations.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of a nonstandard electron mass $m_e$ on early-Universe thermal history, focusing on neutrino decoupling and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). In the standard cosmology, neutrino--electron interactions keep neutrinos in thermal contact with the electromagnetic plasma until shortly before $e^\pm$ annihilation. Varying $m_e$ shifts the decoupling epoch and the entropy transfer from $e^\pm$ annihilation, thereby modifying the neutrino energy density and the inferred effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Independently, during BBN the rates of charged-current weak processes, and hence the neutron-to-proton ratio, depend on $m_e$. By confronting BBN predictions for the primordial light-element abundances with observations and imposing cosmological constraints on $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, we obtain a bound on $m_e$ in the early Universe of $m_e = 0.504^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ MeV or $m_e=0.510\pm0.007$ MeV ($1σ$), depending on the considered nuclear reaction network (NACRE II or PRIMAT, respectively). The allowed range is close to the present laboratory value at the level of 1.4\%, thus supporting the constancy of the electron mass over cosmological timescales.

*John A. Dixon*

TL;DR: The paper extends a previous model (EP exotic invariant model from paper E4) by incorporating a U(1) gauge theory, marking the fifth installment in the series of papers En.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the existing EP model's theoretical framework by integrating a U(1) gauge theory, likely aiming to explore additional symmetries, dynamics, or applications within the model's context.

Method: The method involves adding a U(1) gauge theory component to the original EP exotic invariant model, building upon the structure established in paper E4. This addition introduces gauge fields and associated interactions into the model.

Result: The results include the successful integration of the U(1) gauge theory into the model, potentially leading to new predictions, a more comprehensive framework, or improved consistency with physical principles.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that incorporating the U(1) gauge theory strengthens the model's theoretical basis, opens avenues for further research, and sets a foundation for subsequent papers in the En series.

Abstract: Here we add a U(1) gauge theory to the simple EP exotic invariant model in the paper E4. This paper E5 is the fifth in a series of papers En.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses the medium separation scheme (MSS) with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to study dense QCD matter in various scenarios, showing consistency with lattice QCD results and validating effective models as tools for understanding nonperturbative features beyond the conformal limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the violation of the conformal limit for the speed of sound in QCD at finite density and explore the effectiveness of the NJL model combined with MSS across different QCD phases.

Method: Application of the MSS in the NJL model to analyze QCD at finite isospin density, two-color QCD, and two-flavor color superconductivity, with comparisons to lattice QCD data.

Result: The NJL model with MSS consistently describes results across QCD phase diagram regimes, aligning well with lattice simulations and demonstrating its capability to capture nonperturbative features of dense matter.

Conclusion: Effective models like NJL (with proper regularization via MSS) complement lattice simulations by providing insights into nonperturbative dense QCD dynamics beyond current computational limits.

Abstract: In this work, we discuss recent results obtained with the application of the medium separation scheme (MSS) in different contexts where a clear violation of the conformal limit for the speed of sound at finite density has been observed in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We analyze several scenarios, including QCD at finite isospin density, two-color QCD, and two-flavor color superconductivity. Whenever possible, we compare our findings with lattice QCD (LQCD) results, showing that the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model combined with the MSS provides a consistent description across different regimes of the QCD phase diagram. Our analysis highlights how effective models, when properly regularized, can capture essential nonperturbative features of dense QCD matter, offering complementary insights to lattice simulations.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Monte-Carlo generator for simulating di-jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions at next-to-leading order QCD with parton showers, aimed at supporting the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider's spin program. It shows parton showers improve agreement with data in specific regions and critically evaluates experimental selection criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the simulation accuracy for di-jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions, supporting the spin physics program at RHIC, and to assess the robustness of experimental selection criteria through perturbative stability analysis.

Method: Development of a POWHEG BOX-based Monte-Carlo generator that combines next-to-leading order QCD calculations with parton showers. The method involves computing various observables relevant to RHIC's spin program and analyzing the impact of parton-shower effects on predictions.

Result: Parton-shower effects were found to be generally small but significant in certain regions where they improved theoretical predictions' alignment with experimental data. The analysis also highlighted the need for refining experimental selection criteria to ensure perturbative stability.

Conclusion: The new generator provides a reliable tool for RHIC's spin experiments, demonstrating the importance of including parton showers for precise predictions. The critical evaluation of selection criteria underscores the necessity for careful experimental design to maintain theoretical consistency.

Abstract: We present a new Monte-Carlo generator for the simulation of di-jet production in polarized proton-proton collisions at the next-to-leading order in QCD matched to parton showers using the framework of the POWHEG BOX. With this program we compute a variety of observables of immediate relevance for the spin program of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. While parton-shower effects are generally small, we find that in some search regions their inclusion improves agreement of predictions with data. Moreover, we provide a critical assessment of selection criteria applied in experiment in the light of perturbative stability.

### [38] [Tidal disruption event rates across cosmic time: forecasts for LSST, Roman, and JWST and their constraints on the supermassive black hole mass function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04947)
*Mitchell Karmen,Suvi Gezari,Colin Norman,Muryel Guolo*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper develops a semi-empirical model to study the redshift evolution of tidal disruption event (TDE) rates, linking them to the evolution of supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass functions and galaxy processes. It shows that TDE rates peak at cosmic noon and provides a method to constrain SMBH mass function evolution using future surveys like LSST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of measuring SMBH mass distributions at low masses and high redshifts (z>1), which are critical for understanding SMBH seeding and early growth models. Existing methods struggle with this population, making observational constraints necessary.

Method: Constructs a semi-empirical model combining SMBH mass function prescriptions with redshift-evolving factors: galaxy nuclear stellar densities, merger rates, dust obscuration, and a top-heavy IMF. Simulates TDE rate evolution and forecasts detection rates in upcoming surveys.

Result: The model predicts TDE rates increase until z~2 (cosmic noon), then decline due to fewer star-disrupting SMBHs at higher z. Future surveys like LSST and JWST can constrain SMBH mass function evolution through TDE observations.

Conclusion: TDE rates are powerful probes of high-redshift SMBH demographics. The proposed methodology enables using LSST's TDE data to directly measure the evolving SMBH mass function, offering insights into SMBH formation and cosmic growth histories.

Abstract: Measuring the mass distribution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over cosmic time remains particularly challenging for the low mass ($M_{\bullet}\lesssim10^8~M_\odot$) population at $z>1$. This population is also the most sensitive to SMBH seeding and early growth models. In this work we construct a semi-empirical model for the redshift evolution of the TDE rate under multiple SMBH mass function prescriptions, and show that the observed redshift-dependent rate of TDEs is very sensitive to the SMBH mass function and its evolution with redshift. We further incorporate galaxy-scale processes that evolve with redshift -- namely, increasing galaxy nuclear stellar densities, enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, dust obscuration, and a possible top-heavy IMF at early cosmic times -- and quantify their combined impact on the TDE rate. We find that including these effects generally results in a volumetric TDE rate that increases with redshift until a maximum near cosmic noon, before declining at higher redshift where SMBHs that can disrupt stars become increasingly scarce. We forecast TDE rates in the Rubin LSST and the Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, alongside expectations for serendipitous TDE rates in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Finally, we provide a methodology for using a flux-limited survey of TDEs in LSST to directly constrain the redshift evolution of the SMBH mass function.

*César Navarrete,Fernando Vázquez-Chávez,Alejandro Cruz-Osorio,Néstor Ortiz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to analyze the orbital parameters of S2 star around Sagittarius A* using multiple non-rotating black hole spacetime models. It concludes that existing observational data do not statistically differentiate between the tested models, including Schwarzschild, Bardeen, and Yukawa-like geometries, though some models show weak non-conclusive evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the validity of alternative black hole spacetime solutions against General Relativity predictions using precise S2 star orbital data, aiming to identify potential deviations through Bayesian model comparison.

Method: Implementation of MCMC to derive posterior distributions for orbital parameters across seven spacetime models, utilizing recent S2 data (astrometry, spectroscopy, pericentre advance). Bayesian model comparison via log-Bayes factors against Schwarzschild solution.

Result: No statistically significant preference found among models. Bardeen and Yukawa-like models align closely with Schwarzschild, while others (Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, Horndeski, Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton) show only weak, non-decisive evidence against Schwarzschild.

Conclusion: Current observational precision is insufficient to distinguish between tested spacetime models. Results support General Relativity's spacetimes but highlight the need for future more precise data to constrain alternative theories.

Abstract: We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the S2 star orbit around Sagittarius A*, for seven representative non-rotating black hole space-time solutions. In particular, we consider the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, and Bardeen black hole space-times from General Relativity, as well as a black hole solution from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, a hairy black hole solution from Horndeski theory, and a Yukawa-like black hole from $f(\mathscr{R})$ gravity. To constrain model parameters, we use the most recent publicly available observational data of the S2 star orbit, namely astrometric measurements, spectroscopic data, and the pericentre advance measured by the GRAVITY Collaboration. We further perform a consistent Bayesian comparison of models, calculating the log-Bayes factor of each space-time with respect to the Schwarzschild solution. Our results show that the currently available data indicate no statistically significant preference among the space-times considered. The Bardeen and Yukawa-like models are indistinguishable from Schwarzschild within current uncertainties, while the Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, Horndeski and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton geometries show at most weak and non-decisive strength of evidence under the adopted priors and likelihood choices.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper uses 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to model radio emission from the merging galaxy cluster MACS J0018.5+1626. Through the ICM-SHOX framework combining multi-wavelength observations, it identifies a binary cluster merger near pericenter passage. Simulations demonstrate that merger-driven shocks with Mach numbers ~2-3 can explain LOFAR observations, suggesting the radio halo may result from two radio relics viewed face-on.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the observed radio emission in MACS J0018.5 using multi-wavelength data and validate if merger-driven shocks and diffusive shock acceleration can reproduce LOFAR observations.

Method: 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations coupled with particle tracers and Fokker-Planck solver, constrained by X-ray, SZ, optical, and lensing data via ICM-SHOX pipeline. Parameters like velocity and impact parameter variations were tested under likely initial conditions.

Result: Consistent formation of two merger shocks with Mach ~2-3, and radio emission modeling shows that observed radio halo could be two face-on relics superposed, matching LOFAR data.

Conclusion: Multi-wavelength analysis and simulations confirm the binary merger scenario at pericenter passage. The radio halo's origin as dual relics aligns with observations, supporting merger-driven shock acceleration models.

Abstract: We present the first detailed numerical modeling of the radio emission from MACS J0018.5+1626 as part of the Improved Constraints on Mergers with SZ, Hydrodynamical simulations, Optical, and X-ray (ICM-SHOX) project. By matching X-ray, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich, optical and lensing observables to simulations, the ICM-SHOX pipeline indicates that MACS J0018.5+1626 is undergoing a binary merger close to pericenter passage and is observed along a line of sight nearly aligned with the merger axis. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary cluster mergers coupled to tracer particles and a Fokker--Planck solver to model the radio emission. Exploring variations in the most likely initial conditions within the ICM-SHOX parameter space, such as the relative cluster velocity and impact parameter, we find that the resulting merger configuration consistently produces two merger-driven shocks with typical average Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}_s \sim 2$--$3$ with corresponding standard deviations of $σ_{\mathcal{M}} \sim 0.5$--$1.5$. Within this framework, we examine the cluster conditions under which standard diffusive shock acceleration can reproduce LOFAR observations. In particular, we discuss the possibility that the apparent radio halo seen by LOFAR arises from the superposition of two radio relics viewed nearly face-on.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explored whether long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be linked to neutron star binary mergers by searching for gravitational-wave signals coincident with long GRBs during the third LVK observing run but found no evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent kilonova detections with long GRBs suggest that some neutron star mergers might produce long GRBs, motivating the search for associated gravitational waves.

Method: Analyzed LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data for binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole gravitational-wave signals coincident with long GRBs detected by Fermi and Swift, focusing on periods with at least two operational observatories.

Result: No gravitational-wave signals were found, leading to distance limits set for each GRB assuming mergers powered them.

Conclusion: The lack of detected signals suggests long GRBs may not commonly originate from binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole mergers under the study's assumptions.

Abstract: Neutron star binary mergers are often associated with short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the recent detection of kilonovae coincident with long GRBs suggest that some mergers may produce long GRBs. Motivated by these developments, we perform a search for binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole gravitational-wave signals coincident with long GRBs using data from the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing run. We analyze LVK data coincident with long GRBs detected by Fermi's GRB Monitor and Swift's Burst Alert Telescope when at least two gravitational-wave observatories were running. We find no evidence of a coincident gravitational-wave signal and set limits on the luminosity distance to each of these long GRBs under the assumption that they were powered by binary mergers.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper reports on the multi-band study of the radio quasar B3 1239+376 (z=3.82), identifying it as the third most distant γ-ray-emitting blazar. A significant γ-ray detection (7.7σ) with strong association probability (0.91) is observed over a half-year period, with correlated γ-ray and infrared flares. Broadband SED modeling suggests jet properties consistent with a one-zone leptonic model. Immediate follow-up observations are urged to study potential jet ejections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distant (z>3) γ-ray quasars are critical for understanding early supermassive black hole growth and jet evolution in AGN. Few such sources are known, so studying B3 1239+376 provides key insights into high-redshift blazar populations and their cosmic evolution.

Method: Multi-wavelength analysis combining Fermi-LAT γ-ray data, infrared observations, and radio interferometry. Broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were modeled using a one-zone leptonic radiation model. Cross-correlation analysis was performed between γ-ray and infrared light curves to confirm temporal alignment.

Result: Detection of a significant 7.7σ γ-ray source associated with B3 1239+376 (91% probability). Correlated γ-ray and infrared flares peaking simultaneously. Broadband SEDs in different flux states matched the leptonic model. Prior epoch γ-ray residues detected. The object is now the third most distant known γ-ray blazar.

Conclusion: B3 1239+376 establishes new constraints on high-redshift blazar activity and jet properties. Its detection highlights the importance of multi-wavelength campaigns for studying early Universe AGN evolution. Urgent follow-up is recommended to capture potential jet ejection events during recent γ-ray brightening.

Abstract: Among thousands of extragalactic $γ$-ray emitters, only a handful of distant ($z >$ 3) sources are detected, yet they are cruial probes shedding light on the cosmic evolution of jets of active galactic nuclei and the initial phase of mass growth of supermassive black holes. Here, we report on a multi-band study of a radio quasar B3 1239+376 with $z$ = 3.82. By analyzing the Fermi-LAT data, a significant (globally 7.7$σ$) $γ$-ray source in its direction, with an estimated association probability of 0.91, is observed in a half-year period of 2025. The analyses also reveal the emergence of co-spatial $γ$-ray residues in prior epochs. Moreover, the $γ$-ray and infrared light curves are likely correlated, particularly, the two emissions climb to the peaking values at the same time. The temporal coincidence establishes a firm association relationship between the $γ$-ray source and the quasar. Therefore, B3 1239+376 is proposed as the {\it third} most distant $γ$-ray-emitting blazar to date. Benefiting from the multi-wavelength observations, broadband spectral energy distributions in different flux states are drawn and reproduced by the classic one-zone leptonic radiation model to investigate the jet properties. Considering the recent brightening in $γ$ rays, prompt follow-up observations are encouraged, especially radio interferometry observations which may catch the potential ejection of a new jet blob.

### [43] [An Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock Model for Long GRBs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05278)
*R. Moradi,C. W. Wang,E. S. Yorgancioglu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock model (AMIS) to explain the prompt emission of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It links the light curve's envelope to the time-dependent accretion rate onto the central engine, producing FRED-like profiles. The model accounts for both global trends and short-term variability through internal shocks and Lorentz factor fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a framework explaining the observational features of long GRB prompt emission, particularly the interplay between the accretion history and the observed light curve variability.

Method: The AMIS model relates the prompt emission envelope to the mass-supply history (initial ~t^0-1/2 rise and ~t^-5/3 decay phases). Internal shocks generate rapid variability, while stochastic Lorentz factor variations in shells explain pulse width variations. The study focuses on single-FRED profiles for simplicity, with complex cases to be addressed later.

Result: The model establishes correlations between spectral evolution, pulse narrowing at high energies, and accretion-driven envelopes. It offers a mechanism to diagnose central engine activity via observed light curve features.

Conclusion: AMIS successfully unifies the global light curve shape (governed by accretion) and short-term fluctuations (due to internal shocks/Lorentz factor variations), providing a foundation for further studies on multiple-pulse GRBs.

Abstract: We introduce the Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock model (AMIS) as a possible framework for explaining the observational properties of long gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission. In this scenario, the envelope of the prompt light curve follows the time-dependent mass-supply history to the central engine, associated with stellar collapse and, where applicable, fallback accretion, whose early-time onset can be approximated by $\dot{M}\propto t^{0-1/2}$ and which subsequently may decay as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-5/3}$, producing a photon count rate with a single fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED)-like profile. In general, the prompt-emission envelope is regulated by a time-dependent mass supply to the central engine, while internal shocks produce the rapid variability. Since we only aim to introduce this framework here, we focus on the simplest single-FRED shape of the prompt emission profiles, while more complex cases involving multiple episodes and interacting shocks will be explored in forthcoming studies. The model indicates correlations between spectral evolution, FRED-pulse narrowing at high energies, and the mass-supply-controlled envelope. Stochastic Lorentz factor variations of ejected mass- or rate-driven shells, superimposed on the Accretion-Modulated envelope, explain the coexistence of smooth global trends and irregular short-timescale features, such as the widths of individual pulses in long GRB light curves, offering diagnostic tools for probing the inner engine activity.

### [44] [The Double-Burst Nature and Early Afterglow Evolution of Long GRB 110801A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05404)
*Qiu-Li Wang,Hao Zhou,Yun Wang,Jia Ren,Zhi-Ping Jin,Da-Ming Wei*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes GRB 110801A using multi-band data, highlighting a two-episode structure in gamma rays and different physical origins for optical and high-energy emissions. The optical light curve's behavior is explained by reverse and forward shocks, and key parameters like Lorentz factor, jet angle, and energy are constrained.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical mechanisms behind the double-burst structure of GRB 110801A and the chromatic emission differences between optical and high-energy bands through multi-wavelength analysis.

Method: Temporal and spectral analysis of Swift and ground-based data, joint broadband spectral fitting with a two-component model (power-law + Band function), and synchrotron modeling to explain emission origins and afterglow dynamics.

Result: The optical emission precedes high-energy bursts, indicating different origins; the two-component model better explains the data; afterglow light curve transitions are fit by RS/FS interactions; derived parameters include Γ₀ ~60, θ_j ~0.09, and E_k,iso ~10^54.8 erg.

Conclusion: GRB 110801A's complex emission arises from distinct physical processes (afterglow and prompt emission) in separate episodes, supporting shock models and providing stringent constraints on burst energetics and geometry.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 110801A, utilizing multi-band data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based telescopes. The $γ$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (``double-burst'') structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $γ$-rays at $\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $γ$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components. We constrain the key physical parameters of the burst, deriving an initial Lorentz factor $Γ_0 \sim 60$, a jet half-opening angle $θ_j \sim 0.09$, and an isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\rm k,iso} \sim 10^{54.8}$ erg.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes GRB light curves to differentiate between Blandford-Znajek (BZ) and neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) mechanisms using the luminosity decay slope (d). Of 85 GRBs, 15 align with BZ (d≈1.67) and 22 with NDAF (d≈3.7–7.8). Most GRBs show intermediate slopes (2–4), suggesting hybrid mechanisms dominated by NDAF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish between competing GRB central engine models (BZ vs. NDAF) by linking light-curve characteristics to underlying physics.

Method: Analyzed 85 single-peaked Swift/BAT GRBs with FRED profiles using 64 ms resolution light curves. Applied the KRL function to fit decay slopes and compared results with theoretical d values for BZ (1.67) and NDAF (3.7–7.8).

Result: 15 GRBs match BZ predictions, 22 align with NDAF. Majority (∼65%) have slopes between 2-4, indicating possible hybrid mechanisms with NDAF dominance.

Conclusion: Decay slope analysis provides a viable method to discriminate between BZ and NDAF mechanisms. Hybrid models may better explain observed GRB diversity, with neutrino processes playing a dominant role in most cases.

Abstract: Hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole systems are leading candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant.

### [46] [Particle acceleration signatures in the time-dependent one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model of blazar flares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05601)
*Paloma Thevenet,Andreas Zech,Catherine Boisson,Anton Dmytriiev*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study analyzes multiwavelength flare light curves from BL Lac objects using a one-zone leptonic model to distinguish physical mechanisms (e.g., particle injection, acceleration, losses) responsible for flares. It finds that energy-dependent time delays and flare rising profiles can differentiate between mechanisms, demonstrated through analysis of Mrk 421 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blazar flares are poorly understood; the study aims to identify observational signatures that discriminate between physical processes in relativistic jets using systematic modeling.

Method: Explores combinations of particle acceleration/loss mechanisms (injection, diffusive shock, stochastic acceleration, escape, adiabatic/radiative losses) within an SSC one-zone model to generate light curves. Tests scenarios using 'hard-sphere' scattering and compares synthetic light curve features to observed data (e.g., Mrk 421).

Result: Different mechanisms produce distinct light curve shapes, especially in energy-dependent time lags and flare rise profiles. High-quality multiwavelength data is critical for distinguishing between scenarios.

Conclusion: Multiwavelength observations with sufficient quality can uncover unique signatures of particle acceleration/loss mechanisms in blazar jets, advancing understanding of flare physics. The study emphasizes the need for advanced data to validate theoretical models.

Abstract: The study of multiwavelength flux and spectral variations during rapid flares from blazars provides strong constraints on the physical parameters of the compact emission regions responsible for these still poorly understood events. Although a full description of the continuous and transient emission from blazars seems to require more sophisticated scenarios, particle acceleration and loss mechanisms can be approximately described within the simple leptonic one-zone framework, enabling a systematic study of their impact on the observable properties of multiwavelength flare light curves. Our goal is to identify characteristic signatures in these light curve profiles that permit one to discriminate between the main physical processes situated inside the relativistic jet and commonly invoked to explain blazar flares. The present study exclusively focuses on modeling rapid flares from BL Lac type objects, which can be described within the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission scenario. Combinations of several commonly employed mechanisms to describe the gain and loss of energetic particles in onezone models during flaring events are studied in a systematic way: particle injection; diffusive shock and stochastic acceleration and reacceleration; particle escape; adiabatic losses; radiative losses through synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation. The current study is limited to the case of "hard-sphere" scattering. A large variety of light curve shapes arises from the different scenarios under study. Characteristic signatures, in particular energy-dependent time delays and differences in the shapes of the rising part of the flare, should allow the distinction to be made between different injection and acceleration scenarios, given the availability of sufficiently high-quality multiwavelength data sets. This is illustrated with a simplified application to a flare event from the blazar Mrk 421.

### [47] [Coalescence Forensics: Weighing the Hosts of Hierarchical Binary Black Hole Mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05645)
*Avinash Tiwari,Shasvath J. Kapadia*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to determine the mass of star clusters hosting hierarchical binary black hole mergers detected via gravitational waves, using recoil velocities and cluster dynamics. Analysis of two example events suggests host clusters are likely heavy globular or nuclear star clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to constrain the masses of star clusters that produce hierarchical binary black hole mergers observed through gravitational waves, enabling insights into the formation environments and dynamics of these systems.

Method: The method uses a Plummer model to derive analytic scaling relations between host cluster mass, recoil velocity of the binary remnant, and cluster structural parameters. Numerical integration over variables like velocities, angles, and cluster parameters is performed to calculate Bayesian posteriors for host mass.

Result: Application to GW241011 and GW241110 yields host cluster masses between 10^5.7 to 10^7.7 solar masses at 68% confidence. This suggests the hosts are likely heavy globular clusters or nuclear star clusters.

Conclusion: The framework successfully infers host cluster masses for individual GW events. The inferred mass range supports the idea that these mergers occur in dense stellar environments, and future high-recoil events could better constrain cluster structures.

Abstract: We present a novel framework to infer the mass of clusters that host hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected with gravitational-waves (GWs), on a single event basis. We show that the requirement that a second-generation (2G) remnant be retained, and subsequently undergo a dynamical encounter, places strong constraints on the mass of the cluster. Using a Plummer model as a readily interpretable baseline, we derive analytic scaling relations between the peak of the inferred host mass posterior, the GW-driven recoil velocity of the remnant, and the parameters that determine the structure of the host. We then perform exact numerical marginalization over thermal and recoil velocities, angles, and cluster structure parameters, to infer the host-mass posterior. We apply our framework to putative hierarchical mergers GW241011 and GW241110, and infer the masses of their hosts on a single-event basis. We find that these are consistent with either heavy globular clusters or nuclear star clusters, with inferred masses spanning $10^{5.7 - 7.7} M_{\odot}$ at $68\%$ confidence depending on the 2G recoil velocity distribution used.

### [48] [Relativistic Dynamics and Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton Accretion onto Rotating Embedded Black Hole Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05747)
*Asifa Ashraf,Orhan Donmez,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Chengxun Yuan,Aylin Caliskan,Gulzoda Rakhimova,Ahmadjon Abdujabbarov*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates test particle motion and relativistic accretion onto rotating, embedded black holes (BHs). It analyzes orbital dynamics, effective potentials, and hydrodynamic simulations, showing that the embedding parameter α alters shock cone morphology, reduces post-shock compression, and enhances accretion variability. α increases QPO frequency observability, particularly 3:2 ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how black hole embedding parameters and rotation affect particle trajectories and accretion dynamics beyond the Kerr spacetime model.

Method: 1. Analyzed circular orbits and stability conditions in embedded Kerr spacetimes. 2. Constructed effective potential/force models to study gravitational interactions. 3. Derived analytic expressions for orbital frequencies. 4. Performed GRMHD simulations of BHL accretion flows considering varying α and spin parameters.

Result: 1. α widens shock cone angles and reduces post-shock compression. 2. Frame-dragging suppresses accretion rate oscillations but α increases them. 3. Higher α strengthens low-frequency QPOs (3:2 ratios) observable.

Conclusion: The embedding parameter α significantly modifies black hole accretion dynamics and observational signatures, suggesting its importance in interpreting astrophysical observations beyond standard Kerr models.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the motion of test particles and relativistic accretion mechanisms within the spacetime of a rotating and embedded BH. In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter αsystematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing α, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $α$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study provides precise measurements of the binary pulsar PSR J1906+0746 over 18 years using multiple telescopes. Results support a double neutron star system but hint at a possible massive white dwarf companion due to spin-orbit coupling effects. A notable glitch similar to the Vela pulsar was also observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine parameters of PSR J1906+0746's relativistic binary system, test general relativity, and explore the companion's nature through timing analysis. The investigation also aims to detect gravitational wave-induced orbital decay and potential spin-orbit coupling effects.

Method: Collected timing data from six radio telescopes over 18 years. Combined data into a coherent timing solution to measure periastron advance, Einstein delay, and orbital period change. Compared mass estimates under GR assumptions versus allowing for semi-major axis changes. Analyzed a detected glitch event.

Result: Precise measurements: periastron advance (7.5841±0.0002°/yr), Einstein delay (4.59e-4 s), orbital period derivative (-5.65e-13 s/s). Masses under GR: 1.316±0.005 $M_\odot$ (pulsar), 1.297±0.005 $M_\odot$ (companion). Detected $~x$ = -1.8±0.6e-13 s/s indicates possible spin-orbit coupling. Glitch observed matches Vela pulsar's characteristics.

Conclusion: Results confirm double neutron star system under GR, but $~x$ suggests companion could be a massive white dwarf formed prior, like in PSR J1141-6545. Further observations are needed to confirm spin-orbit coupling and resolve companion nature. Glitch analysis highlights similarities with other pulsars.

Abstract: We conducted a timing analysis of over 18 years of data on the young ($τ_{\rm c} = 112$ kyr, $P = 114$\,ms) relativistic binary PSR~J1906+0746, using six radio telescopes: Arecibo, FAST, Green Bank, Lovell, MeerKAT, and Nançay. This pulsar is known to orbit a compact high-mass companion with a period of 3.98\,hrs in a mildly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.085$). By combining all data and maintaining a coherent timing solution over the full span, we obtained a more precise measurement of the advance of periastron, $\dotω = 7.5841(2)$\,$°$\,yr$^{-1}$, the Einstein delay, $γ= 4.59(2) \times 10^{-4}$\,s, and the secular change in orbital period, $\dot{P}_{\rm b} = -5.65(2) \times 10^{-13}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$. Assuming the validity of general relativity, we obtain a total mass of 2.6133(1)\,$M_{\odot}$ and component masses of 1.316(5) $M_{\odot}$ for the pulsar and 1.297(5) $M_{\odot}$ for the companion, consistent with a double neutron star system. However, when fitting for the secular change in the projected semi-major axis we obtain $\dot{x} = -1.8(6) \times 10^{-13}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$, the component masses are shifted by $\sim 3.5σ$, which is expected from the correlation of $\dot{x}$ and $γ$. The $\dot{x}$ has a similar magnitude to that observed in PSR~J1141$-$6545, which is due to spin-orbit coupling; if confirmed, it would indicate that, as in the latter system, the companion of the PSR~J1906+0746 system is a massive fast-rotating white dwarf formed before the pulsar. Additionally, we report and characterize a large glitch near MJD 56664, with a fractional frequency increase comparable to those observed in the Vela pulsar.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance particle physics and test dark matter models by improving sensitivity in indirect dark matter detection using dSphs' high DM-to-baryonic matter ratio and low background emission.

Method: Expanded analysis of 26 dSph galaxies with improved HAWC event reconstruction algorithms, covering more annihilation channels and data, reducing hadronic contamination.

Result: No detected dark matter signal; upper limits set at ~10⁻²³ cm³/s for ⟨σv⟩ across 1-10⁴ TeV DM masses.

Conclusion: Results constrain DM annihilation models, particularly for high-mass particles, and demonstrate enhanced HAWC sensitivity for future studies.

Abstract: Understanding dark matter's elusive nature is crucial for the framework of particle physics and expanding the Standard Model. This analysis utilizes the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray Observatory to indirectly search for dark matter (DM) by studying gamma ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Selected for their high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter, dSphs are useful for this type of search owing to the low background emission. In comparison to previous HAWC studies, we significantly improve our sensitivity to DM from dSphs due to improvements to our event reconstruction and reduced hadronic contamination. We expanded the number of dSphs studied, DM annihilation channels into the Standard Model (SM), and the amount of data collected on each previously studied dSph. We searched for DM signals in each dSph using the latest version of the algorithms used to reconstruct data from the primary detector of the HAWC instrument. We report that we do not detect evidence of DM from dSphs, so we place upper limits for the velocity-weighted DM annihilation cross-section ($\langleσv \rangle$) on the order of $10^{-23}~\text{cm}^3\text{s}^{-1}$ for a DM mass range of $1-10^4$ TeV.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes cross-correlation functions (CCFs) between soft and hard X-ray emissions from the Z-source neutron star binary GX 349+2, revealing asymmetric lags in the horizontal branch and symmetric CCFs in other states. These findings suggest the boundary layer near the inner accretion disk adjusts during flux transitions, with lags correlating to the boundary layer's size and depletion timescale.

Motivation: To understand the structure and dynamics of inner accretion regions around neutron stars by studying X-ray lags in GX 349+2.

Method: CCF analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations, Monte Carlo simulations for significance testing, and spectral analysis during flux transitions.

Result: Asymmetric CCFs with lags of 100-1000s in horizontal branch, symmetric CCFs in other branches. Boundary layer size estimated, and lags linked to its depletion timescale with low viscosity.

Conclusion: Observed lags arise from boundary layer adjustments near the inner disk edge, providing insights into accretion dynamics and boundary layer properties.

Abstract: Studying the cross-correlation function between the soft and hard X-ray emission in Neutron Star Low Mass X-ray Binaries provides crucial insight into the structure and dynamics of the innermost accretion regions. In this work, we investigate the CCF of the Z-source GX 349+2 using an XMM-Newton observation. We noted that asymmetric CCFs with lags of a few hundred secondsbetween soft and hard band LCs in the horizontal branch, whereas CCFs remained symmetric in normal and flaring branches. We also performed a CCF study during the flux transition duration and observed lags of the order of a few tens to hundreds of seconds. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the robustness of these CCFs, confirming their significance at a 95% confidence level. Spectral analysis during the flux transitions further suggests that the inner accretion disk extends close to the last stable orbit. We propose that the observed hard lags arise from the readjustment of the boundary layer/coronal region located near the inner edge of the accretion disk. From the measured lags, we estimate the characteristic size of the boundary layer. We show that the observed lags could also be associated with the depletion timescale of the boundary layer with low viscosity.
