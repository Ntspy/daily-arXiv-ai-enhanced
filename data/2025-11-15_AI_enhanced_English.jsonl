Cornish"], "title": "Non-stationary noise in gravitational wave analyses: The wavelet domain noise covariance matrix", "comment": "7 pages, no figures", "summary": "Gravitational wave detectors produce time series of the gravitational wave strain co-added with instrument noise. For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper analyzes the suitability of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis for handling non-stationary noise in gravitational wave data, finding that the diagonal noise covariance approximation holds when noise variations are slow in both time and frequency. Off-diagonal terms depend on derivatives of the spectral model and strategies for rapidly varying noise are outlined.", "motivation": "To determine conditions under which the WDM wavelet domain's diagonal noise covariance matrix approximation remains valid for non-stationary noise analysis, crucial for efficient gravitational wave data processing.", "method": "The authors investigated the WDM wavelet packet basis by examining the noise correlation matrix under varying time and frequency conditions, deriving dependencies of off-diagonal terms on noise's time and frequency derivatives.", "result": "The diagonal approximation holds when noise varies slowly across wavelet pixels in both time and frequency. Off-diagonal elements are proportional to derivatives of the dynamic spectral model, validating wavelet use for slowly varying noise.", "conclusion": "WDM wavelets are suitable for non-stationary noise with slow variations; however, alternative strategies are needed for rapid noise changes. The findings apply broadly to wavelet transforms with compact time-frequency filters."}}
