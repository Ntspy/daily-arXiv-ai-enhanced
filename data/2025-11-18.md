### [1] [Constants of motion and fundamental frequencies for elliptic orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10735)
*David Trestini*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper derives a conservative map between constants of motion and orbital frequencies for nonspinning compact binaries on quasi-elliptic orbits at 4PN order, including tails. Using action-angle variables and Delaunay averaging, it confirms agreement with/self-force results and updates older flux expressions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend gravitational wave physics for eccentric binaries beyond circular approximations, integrating higher-order PN terms and tail effects to improve accuracy and validate with self-force theory.

Method: Action-angle formulation for local dynamics; time-localizing tail terms via contact transformations; Delaunay averaging; applying the first law of binary mechanics for redshift invariant; re-expressing fluxes from prior works in terms of fundamental frequencies.

Result: Accurate 4PN conservative map valid for any eccentricity; recovered circular orbit results; redshift invariant matches analytical self-force results at postgeodesic order; updated flux expressions at third PN order.

Conclusion: Confirm PN formalism's consistency with self-force for eccentric binaries. Provides foundational tools for precision GW modeling, especially for eccentric systems in LIGO/Virgo observations and future eLISA missions.

Abstract: In the case of nonspinning compact binary systems on quasi-elliptic orbits, I obtain the conservative map between the constants of motion (energy and angular momentum) and the fundamental (radial and azimuthal) frequencies at the fourth post-Newtonian order, including both instantaneous and tail contributions. This map is expressed in terms of an enhancement function of the eccentricity, which is appropriately resummed to ensure accuracy for any eccentricity; in particular, I recover known results for circular orbits. In order to obtain this map, the local dynamics are expressed using an action-angle formulation. The tail term is treated as a perturbation, which is first localized in time, then Delaunay-averaged. Both operations require a contact transformation of the phase-space variables, which I explicitly control. Using the first law of binary black hole mechanics, I then obtain the orbit-averaged redshift invariant for eccentric orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order; when properly accounting for the tail contributions, it perfectly agrees with analytical self-force at postgeodesic order [arXiv:2203.13832]. Finally, I use these results to re-express the fluxes of energy and angular momentum obtained at third post-Newtonian order in [arXiv:0711.0302] and [arXiv:0908.3854] in terms of fundamental frequencies.

### [2] [Diffusion in the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10738)
*Jonathan Oppenheim,Emanuele Panella*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores a classical-quantum hybrid gravity theory by analyzing the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation, revealing non-local field covariance and energy divergences. It implications for gravitational wave energy density are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical-quantum hybrid gravity theories require understanding interactions between classical gravitational fields and quantum matter fields. Studying the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation helps establish phenomenological predictions for such systems.

Method: Computed non-equilibrium two-point functions using a 'mod-squared-retarded' pole prescription, analyzing divergence regulation by initial states and covariance's spacetime scaling behavior.

Result: Field covariance is non-zero only outside lightcones, scales inversely with spatial distance, and grows linearly in time. Energy shows contact divergence like quantum cases.

Conclusion: Anomalous diffusion effects in hybrid gravity could lead to detectable gravitational wave backgrounds, with energy density estimable via scalar field covariances.

Abstract: Theories of gravity in which the metric is fundamentally classical predict stochastic fluctuations in the gravitational field. In this article, we study the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation as a starting point to understand the phenomenology of linearised classical-quantum hybrid gravity. In particular, we describe how to compute the non-equilibrium two point function of the scalar field, showing explicitly the role of the initial state in regulating divergences. To do so, we use a "mod-squared-retarded" pole-prescription and find that the covariance in the field is non-zero only outside the lightcone, scales inversely with the spatial distance of the spacetime points and grows linearly in time. The energy has a contact divergence similar to that found in the quantum case. We conclude by discussing possible implications of anomalous diffusion for hybrid theories of gravity, especially looking at the energy density in the predicted gravitational waves background, which can be inferred from the scalar covariances.

### [3] [CPT symmetry in the mirror universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11109)
*Natalia Gorobey,Alexander Lukyanenko,A. V. Goltsev*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Proposes a two-sheeted universe model in quantum gravity, incorporating 3D invariant proper time and CPT symmetry. Develops a covariant quantum field theory and constructs a CPT-symmetric state using an iterative method with the Hartle-Hawking wave function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in quantum gravity, particularly in defining a uniform time parameter and ensuring CPT symmetry in a closed universe model.

Method: Introduces a uniform time via a Hermitian 3D operator's spectrum on Dirac bi-spinors, formulates CPT symmetry through discrete transformations, and applies iterative methods with the Hartle-Hawking state.

Result: Constructs a CPT-symmetric state for a two-sheeted universe model, maintaining consistency with charge conjugation operations and incorporating the no-boundary proposal.

Conclusion: The model provides a framework for quantum gravity in closed universes by unifying proper time definitions and CPT symmetry, offering a pathway for further study in quantum cosmology.

Abstract: A model of a two-sheeted universe in the quantum theory of gravity is proposed, based on the definition of 3D invariant and gauge-invariant proper time of the universe. A uniform time in a closed universe is introduced in the class of equivalent reference systems defined by the spectrum of a Hermitian 3D operator on the space of Dirac bi-spinors, the equality to zero of which is equivalent to a system of gravitational constraints. Based on the analogy with the Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory in Minkowski space and the definition of discrete C-, P- and T-transformations separately, the principle of CPT symmetry in a two-sheeted universe is formulated. A covariant quantum theory of matter gauge fields consistent with the charge conjugation operation in a two-sheeted universe is proposed. The CPT symmetric state of a homogeneous isotropic two-sheeted model of the universe is constructed by an iterative method in which the no-boundary Hartle--Hawking wave function is used as a zeroth approximation.

### [4] [Quantum Spacetime Imprints: The 24-Cell, Standard Model Symmetry and Its Flavor Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10685)
*Ahmed Farag Ali*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In our previous work \cite{FaragAli:2024jpo} we outlined an exploratory framework in which the 24-cell acts both as the quantum of spacetime and as a geometric representation of elementary particles. In this paper we provide comprehensive mathematical and phenomenological evidence that deepens and refines this primary model. The symmetry of the 24-cell yields a unified hypercharge functional that reproduces Standard Model hypercharge assignments while ensuring anomaly cancellation. By projecting the vertices of the 24-cell onto a three-dimensional flavor subspace using a Minimal Distortion Principle, an emergent tetrahedral structure appears that gives rise to an effective $A_4$ symmetry in the neutrino sector. Extending this discrete symmetry to its binary double cover $T^\prime$ provides the spinorial representations and intrinsic complex phases needed to generate realistic quark Yukawa textures. Guided by the tenet that spacetime and matter are inextricably linked, our analysis suggests that the intricate flavor mixing of the Standard Model may be a residual imprint of the underlying quantum-geometric nature of spacetime.

### [5] [Quantifying vacuum-like jets in heavy-ion collisions: a Machine Learning study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10724)
*Miguel Crispim Romão,João Arruda Gonçalves,José Guilherme Milhano*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes using a Transformer classifier to distinguish jets modified by the Quark Gluon Plasma from unmodified ones in nucleus-nucleus collisions, improving over traditional methods that rely on high-level observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vacuum-like jets in nucleus-nucleus collisions dilute modification signals, hindering studies of underlying mechanisms. A jet-by-jet classification method is needed to isolate truly modified jets.

Method: Train a Transformer classifier on low-level jet constituent 4-momenta data to discriminate between modified and unmodified jets, considering medium response and underlying event contamination.

Result: Transformer effectively identifies unequivocally modified jets and estimates an upper bound for indistinguishable vacuum-like jets in nucleus-nucleus collisions.

Conclusion: The Transformer approach outperforms traditional methods by accessing discriminative features in low-level data, enabling more precise analysis of jet-medium interactions.

Abstract: The modification of jets by interaction with the Quark Gluon Plasma has been extensively established through the comparison of observables computed for samples of jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and proton-proton collisions. The presence of vacuum-like jets, jets that experienced little interaction with the Quark Gluon Plasma, in the nucleus-nucleus samples dilutes the overall observed modification hindering the detailed study of the underlying physical mechanisms. The ability to ascertain on a jet-by-jet basis the degree of modification of a jet would be an invaluable step in overcoming this limitation. We consider a Transformer classifier, trained on a low-level representation of jets given by the 4-momenta of all its constituents. We show that the Transformer is able to capture discriminating information not accessible to other architectures which use high-level physical observables as input. The Transformer allows us to identify, in the experimentally relevant case where both medium response and underlying event contamination are accounted for, a class of jets that have been unequivocally modified. Further, we perform a robust estimate of the upper bound for the fraction of jets in nucleus-nucleus collisions that are, for all purposes, indistinguishable from those produced in proton-proton collisions.

### [6] [Simplified Spin Dependence in Dark Matter Direct Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10764)
*Pierce Giffin,Benjamin Lillard,Pankaj Munbodh,Tien-Tien Yu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles using effective field theories, focusing on spin-dependent effects for direct detection. It identifies conditions under which certain material response functions vanish, simplifying scattering rate calculations in parity-symmetric and anisotropic detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles and simplify the computational complexity of scattering rate calculations in diverse detector materials.

Method: Using effective field theories to analyze dark matter interactions, considering spin-dependent interactions and material response functions. The authors examine conditions where response functions cancel (same Hamiltonian initial/final states) or vanish in parity-symmetric materials.

Result: Demonstrated that specific linear combinations of material response functions vanish under certain conditions, reducing the number of independent parameters needed. Derived scattering rates for anisotropic/chiral detectors for generic dark matter-electron spin interactions.

Conclusion: The findings provide a streamlined toolkit for analyzing electron recoil signals across various detector materials, applicable to a broad class of dark matter models.

Abstract: The interactions of dark matter with Standard Model particles can be systematically studied in the language of effective field theories. We investigate dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles, including spin-dependent interactions, for direct detection experiments and demonstrate that, although the scattering rate generally depends on multiple types of material response functions, certain linear combinations of these material response functions vanish if the initial and final electronic states share the same Hamiltonian. We also find that several other response functions vanish in parity-symmetric materials, making these systems as simple as isotropic detectors in some respects. Finally, we present the scattering rate for an anisotropic, possibly chiral detector, for generic dark matter-electron spin interactions. These relations reduce the number of independent response functions needed, thereby simplifying the computational complexity for a broad class of dark matter models. Our results provide a complete and efficient toolkit for analyzing electron recoil signals in diverse detector materials.
