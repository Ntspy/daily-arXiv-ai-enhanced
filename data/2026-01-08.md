### [1] [Reconstructing Minkowski geometry from causal separations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03280)
*Chenyang Amy Hu,David A. Meyer,Eleanor J. Q. Meyer*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that distances between causally related points in Minkowski space determine the complete structure of the space, advancing the Hauptvermutung of causal set theory that Poisson process-based causal sets can approximate the underlying Lorentzian manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show that causal relationships suffice to reconstruct Minkowski space geometry, supporting causal set theory’s conjecture that Poisson process-generated causal sets encode the spacetime’s structure with precision dependent on the process intensity.

Method: Extends Aleksandrov and Zeeman's work by proving that in all dimensions, causal relations and distances between causally linked points determine spatial distances, hence fully defining the Minkowski space structure.

Result: In any dimension, causal and distance information between causally related pairs determines the full Minkowski space structure, closing gaps in previous 2D analyses and advancing Hauptvermutung validation.

Conclusion: Results strengthen causal set theory’s foundational claim, indicating that causal structures from Poisson processes can reconstruct spacetime manifolds with fidelity tied to the sampling density of the process.

Abstract: Aleksandrov, and then Zeeman, showed that the causal relations among the set of points in a Minkowski space of dimension greater than 2 determine the Minkowski space structure of the set up to a global conformal factor. We show that in any dimension the distances between causally related pairs of points determine the distances between spatially related pairs of points, and thus completely determine the Minkowski space structure of the set. This is a step in the direction of proving that causal sets arising from a Poisson process in a Lorentzian manifold determine that manifold up to the degree of approximation inherent in the intensity of the Poisson process -- the Hauptvermutung of causal set theory.

### [2] [From Loop Quantum Gravity to a Theory of Everything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03292)
*Adrian P. C. Lim*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper unifies quantum gravity with fundamental forces by integrating Chern-Simons theory into the Einstein-Hilbert framework using SU(2)×SU(2) gauge group, quantizing geometric observables and showing particle indistinguishability at Planck scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To merge quantum field theories of fundamental forces with quantum gravity, addressing the unresolved question of unifying gauge theories and general relativity.

Method: Combine Chern-Simons gauge theory with Einstein-Hilbert action, reformulate with SU(2)×SU(2) symmetry, compute Wilson Loop observables for hyperlinks in R^4 using path integrals and state models respecting skein relations.

Result: Wilson Loop observables are eigenstates for spin curvature but not area/volume operators unless trivial representation, implying force unification and disappearance at Planck scale.

Conclusion: At Planck scale, quantum gravity causes fundamental forces to merge with spacetime interactions, making particles indistinguishable. This provides a framework for quantum gravity unification.

Abstract: Witten described how a path integral quantization of Wilson Loop observables will define Jones polynomial type of link invariants, using the Chern-Simons gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In this gauge theory, a compact Lie group ${\rm G}$, together with a representation of its Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, describe the symmetry group and fundamental forces acting on the particles respectively. However, it appears that this theory might be part of a bigger theory.
  We will incorporate this theory into the Einstein-Hilbert theory, which when reformulated and quantized using a ${\rm SU}(2) \times {\rm SU}(2)$ gauge group, gives us a quantized theory of gravity in $\mathbb{R}^4$. In this theory, we can quantize area, volume and curvature into quantum operators. By using both the Chern-Simons and Einstein-Hilbert action, we will write down a path integral expression, and compute the Wilson Loop observable for a time-like hyperlink in $\mathbb{R}^4$, each component loop is coloured with a representation for the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g} \times [\mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)]$, unifying the fundamental forces with gravity. This Wilson Loop observable can be computed using link diagrams, and it can be written as a state model, satisfying a Homfly-type skein relations.
  We will show that the Wilson Loop observable remains an eigenstate for the quantum operators corresponding to spin curvature, but it is not an eigenstate for the area and volume quantized operators, unless the representation for $\mathfrak{g}$ is trivial. This implies that in the Planck scale where quantum gravity is important, we see that all the particles are indistinguishable, hence the fundamental forces disappear and only interaction between matter and space-time remains.

### [3] [Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes with Regular Horizons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03296)
*Mariano Cadoni,Leonardo de Lima,Mirko Pitzalis,Davi C. Rodrigues,Andrea P. Sanna*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper provides a general solution to Einstein's equations for anisotropic fluids in cosmological embeddings, addressing singularity issues in previous BH models and offering a new Schwarzschild BH CE without event horizon singularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve curvature singularities at the event horizon in existing cosmological embeddings of black holes and to account for the backreaction of local geometry on cosmological dynamics.

Method: Deriving a general exact solution considering anisotropic fluids within arbitrary FLRW cosmologies while fully incorporating backreaction effects.

Result: A singularity-free solution except at the central point, and a new Schwarzschild CE distinct from McVittie's, regular everywhere outside.

Conclusion: The solution overcomes limitations of prior CE models, enabling accurate descriptions of local objects within expanding universes without problematic singularities.

Abstract: We present the most general and exact solution of Einstein's gravity sourced by an anisotropic fluid describing the cosmological embedding (CE) of a static and spherically-symmetric object, including black holes (BHs) or exotic compact objects, without radial energy influx and in an arbitrary Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology. This is done fully considering backreaction of the local geometry on the cosmological dynamics. Our solution is free of curvature singularities at the would-be BH event horizon, thus solving a main issue of the CE of BH solutions proposed so far. As a byproduct, we derive a new CE of the Schwarzschild BH - distinct from McVitties's original proposal - that is regular everywhere except at the central singularity.

### [4] [Fast frequency-domain phenomenological modeling of eccentric aligned-spin binary black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03340)
*Antoni Ramos-Buades,Quentin Henry,Maria Haney*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: IMRPhenomXE is a new waveform model for eccentric binary black hole systems, extending the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS model to handle higher orbital eccentricities. It achieves high accuracy for initial eccentricities below 0.4 and maintains computational efficiency compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate modeling of gravitational wave signals from eccentric binary black hole mergers, which current quasi-circular models cannot adequately handle. Eccentric systems are expected to be more common than previously thought in future observations, requiring higher-eccentricity waveform models for reliable detection and parameter estimation.

Method: Extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS model by incorporating orbit-averaged equations of motion using quasi-Keplerian parameters up to 3PN order with spin effects. Inspirals are calculated via stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expansions up to e¹². Merger-ringdown phase assumes circularization and uses IMRPhenomXAS. Compared against 186 numerical relativity simulations.

Result: Achieves unfaithfulness below 3% for 72% of simulations with eccentricities <0.4. Accuracy drops for higher eccentricities due to model approximations. Outperforms existing models in computational speed, making it practical for large-scale analyses. Parameter estimation tests show robust performance.

Conclusion: IMRPhenomXE provides a computationally efficient, accurate eccentric waveform model suitable for current and future gravitational wave observations. Its modular design facilitates improvements as detection capabilities advance.

Abstract: We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.

### [5] [Probing beyond-vacuum general relativistic effects with extreme mass-ratio inspirals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03374)
*Tieguang Zi,Mostafizur Rahman,Shailesh Kumar*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies how extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) can detect effects beyond general relativity, considering both dark matter environments and scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity. It shows that these factors alter gravitational wave signals, and future detectors like LISA could distinguish these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether EMRIs can probe environmental (dark matter) and modified gravity (sGB) effects, which are not accounted for in standard general relativistic models, ensuring accurate tests of gravity theories.

Method: Used two-timescale analysis and fixed-frequency formalism to calculate energy flux corrections for EMRI orbits. Constructed gravitational waveforms, computed dephasing/mismatch, and performed Fisher Matrix analysis for parameter estimation with LISA.

Result: Both dark matter and sGB effects cause detectable changes in EMRI waveforms. A combined analysis can disentangle these effects, showing the necessity of including beyond-vacuum factors for reliable gravity tests.

Conclusion: Future space-based detectors like LISA can measure environmental and modified gravity impacts via EMRI signals, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive models beyond vacuum solutions for gravity testing.

Abstract: We examine extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as probes of beyond-vacuum general relativistic effects, accounting for both astrophysical environments and scalar Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity. In beyond-vacuum scenarios, the evolution of an EMRI immersed in a cold dark matter environment modifies the gravitational wave flux and introduces additional dissipative effects such as dynamical friction. In parallel, in the beyond-general relativistic settings such as in sGB gravity, the inspiraling object carries an effective scalar charge and emits scalar radiation. Both environmental and modified-gravity effects modify the flux-balance law, thereby inducing changes in the EMRI dynamics. Using a two-timescale analysis within the fixed-frequency formalism, we compute leading-order corrections to the energy fluxes for quasi-circular, equatorial orbits in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes and construct the corresponding gravitational waveforms, which are used to quantify the accumulated gravitational wave dephasing and waveform mismatch relative to the vacuum general relativistic case. We further perform the Fisher Information Matrix analysis to estimate parameter correlations and the ability of future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to disentangle environmental and modified gravity effects. Our results show that both dark matter and scalar field effects can leave measurable imprints on EMRI waveforms and that a consistent beyond-vacuum treatment is essential for robust tests of gravity.

### [6] [Superradiant scattering by rotating black-bounce black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03415)
*Pedro Henrique Croti Siqueira,Maurício Richartz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines superradiant scattering off a rotating regular black hole with a black-bounce metric, exploring how parameters influence amplification of massless scalar modes, finding some configurations surpass Kerr by 98%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how deformation parameters of a generalized Kerr spacetime affect superradiance, specifically investigating the impact of parameters like $p$, $k$, and $n$ on energy extraction efficiency.

Method: Numerical integration of the Klein-Gordon equation for $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ scalar modes across varying $(a/M, p/M)$ parameter space, analyzing peak amplification frequencies for different $(k,n)$ combinations.

Result: Increasing $n$ enhances superradiance, while higher $k$ suppresses it; some black-bounce configurations achieve amplification 98% greater than Kerr black holes.

Conclusion: Black-bounce geometries with specific $(k,n)$ parameters significantly exceed Kerr's superradiance limits, suggesting new avenues for probing exotic black hole models through gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: We investigate superradiant scattering off a rotating regular black hole described by a black-bounce metric which generalizes the Kerr spacetime of mass $M$ and specific angular momentum $a$ through a regularization parameter $p$ and two deformation exponents $(k,n)$. Focusing on massless $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ scalar modes, we explore the parameter space and compute amplification factors by numerically integrating the separated radial Klein-Gordon equation. We track the peak amplification and the corresponding frequency across the $(a/M,p/M)$ parameter space for several combinations of $k$ and $n$. We find that increasing $n$ systematically enhances superradiance, whereas increasing $k$ tends to suppress it. In particular, certain configurations yield amplification levels up to 98% larger than the maximum amplification for standard Kerr black holes.

### [7] [Constraining Lorentz and parity violations in gravity with multiband gravitational wave observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03571)
*Zhi-Xin Jia,Tao Zhu,Zhoujian Cao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This study assesses how future multi-band gravitational wave observations from third-generation ground-based and space-based detectors can improve constraints on parity and Lorentz symmetry violations in general relativity. By analyzing specific binary black hole events, the research shows that such a multi-band approach significantly tightens constraints on both high and low-frequency modifications to GR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the enhanced capability of combined ground- and space-based gravitational wave detectors in testing fundamental physics, specifically to constrain deviations from general relativity related to parity and Lorentz symmetry violations.

Method: The study uses a parameterized waveform framework incorporating parameters for deviations from GR, modeled with power-law indices β (β̄ν, β̄μ, βν, βμ). Bayesian analysis is applied to simulated high-SNR 'golden events' (e.g., GW250114) and massive binary systems (e.g., GW231123) across detector networks like CE, ET, LISA, Taiji, and TianQin.

Result: Multi-band observations improve constraint limits on Lorentz and parity violations by orders of magnitude for both high (β>0) and low (β<0) frequency modifications. GW250114-like events excel at constraining high-frequency effects, while massive systems like GW231123 better constrain low-frequency deviations.

Conclusion: Future multi-band gravitational wave astronomy will enable precision tests of GR across diverse binary populations, emphasizing the necessity of combined ground and space-based detector networks for fundamental physics tests.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capability of future multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from binary black hole coalescences, utilizing joint third-generation ground-based (CE, ET) and space-based (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) detector networks, to constrain parity and Lorentz symmetry violations in the gravitational sector. We model these effects through a parameterized waveform framework that incorporates a set of parameters that quantify potential deviations from general relativity. The frequency-dependence of their effects is described by power-law indices $β$ (i.e., $β_{\bar ν}$, $β_{\bar μ}$, $β_ν$, and $β_μ$). By analyzing events such as a high-signal noise ratio (SNR) "golden event" like GW250114 and a massive binary system like GW231123 (total mass $190-265 M_\odot$) using two networks of ground- and space-based detectors, we demonstrate that multi-band observations can significantly improve the current constraints on Lorentz and parity violations by several order of magnitude, for both high-frequency ($β> 0$) and low-frequency ($β< 0$) modifications. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that while the exceptional SNR of the GW250114-like event yields superior constraints for high-frequency modifications ($β> 0$), the massive nature of GW231123 provides more stringent limits for low-frequency effects ($β< 0$). This work highlights the critical value of future multi-band gravitational wave astronomy for conducting precision tests of general relativity across diverse binary populations.

### [8] [Limits on the mass of compact objects in Hořava-Lifshitz gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03644)
*Edwin J. Son*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates theoretical mass limits for compact objects in Hořava-Lifshitz gravity, finding that both the uniform density and sound speed limits intersect the horizon curve at the extremal black hole point (M=q) in the Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend known general relativity mass limits (Buchdahl and causal limits) to the context of deformed Hořava-Lifshitz gravity and understand their relation to black hole horizons.

Method: Derived new mass limits within HL gravity framework, analyzed their behavior using the Kehagias-Sfetsos asymptotically flat solution, and compared intersections with the horizon curve.

Result: Both the uniform density and sound speed limits converge at the minimum horizon where the black hole becomes extremal (M=q), differing from general relativity behavior.

Conclusion: HL gravity's extremal black hole condition unifies the mass limits, suggesting unique properties of compact objects in this modified gravity theory compared to general relativity.

Abstract: It is known that there exist theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in general relativity. One is the Buchdahl limit for an object with an arbitrary equation-of-state that turns out to be the limit for an object with uniform density. Another one is the causal limit that is stronger than the Buchdahl limit and is related to the speed of sound inside an object. Similar theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in deformed Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity are found in this \paper. Interestingly, the both curves of the uniform density limit and the sound speed limit meet the horizon curve at the minimum of the horizon, where a black hole becomes extremal, i.e., $M=q$, considering the Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum that is an asymptotic flat solution in the HL gravity.

### [9] [Motion of spinning particles and chaos bound in Reissner-Nordström spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03751)
*Chuang Yang,Deyou Chen,Yongtao Liu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores Lyapunov exponents of spinning particles around a Reissner-Nordström black hole, finding violations of the chaos bound when spin exceeds a threshold, especially for certain spin directions and charged particles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify the applicability of the chaos bound in the spinor field of a Reissner-Nordström black hole by analyzing Lyapunov exponents of spinning particles.

Method: Investigates Lyapunov exponents for both neutral and charged spinning particles, considering spin magnitude, direction relative to angular momentum, and electromagnetic effects.

Result: For neutral particles, Lyapunov exponents exceed the surface gravity when spin surpasses a threshold, with opposition between spin and angular momentum directions increasing the exponent. Charged particles with large angular momenta also violate the bound despite electromagnetic forces modifying exponent values.

Conclusion: The chaos bound is violated in the spinor field of Reissner-Nordström black holes under specific conditions related to particle spin and charge.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigates Lyapunov exponents of classical chaotic motion of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordström black hole and verifies the applicability of the chaos bound in the spinor field of this black hole. For a neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation of the bound. Given a fixed angular momentum, when the spin direction is opposite to that of the angular momentum, the exponent is greater than that when the two directions are aligned. For a charged particle, after considering the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent variation with respect to the spin or angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. This result shows that the bound is violated in the spinor field.

### [10] [A framework for LISA population inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04168)
*Alexandre Toubiana,Jonathan Gair*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer astrophysical population properties from LISA's Global Fit data, addressing the challenge of analyzing both resolved sources and stochastic backgrounds. It highlights how data analysis choices impact results and demonstrates the framework's potential using a simplified model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LISA's data will contain a mix of resolvable sources and overlapping backgrounds, requiring new methods to decode population-level astrophysical information from the high-dimensional Global Fit. Existing gravitational wave detector analysis techniques are insufficient for this task.

Method: A hierarchical Bayesian framework is developed to directly infer population parameters from Global Fit outputs. It combines information from both resolved sources (above SNR thresholds) and unresolved backgrounds, using a simplified Global Fit model for demonstration.

Result: The approach shows how resolved/unresolved interactions affect population inferences and illustrates that data choices like SNR thresholds significantly influence results. This framework establishes a practical foundation for LISA population studies.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enables effective population-level analysis of LISA data by integrating resolved and unresolved components. It underscores the importance of careful data analysis design to maximize extraction of astrophysical insights from LISA observations.

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.

### [11] [Combining simulation-based inference and universal relations for precise and accurate neutron star science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03945)
*Christian J. Krüger,Sebastian H. Völkel*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach to identify and validate universal relations for neutron star bulk properties, addressing uncertainties from the unknown nuclear equation of state (EOS). It demonstrates improved predictive power over traditional methods and reduces systematic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to systematically explore universal relations in high-dimensional parameter spaces while accounting for uncertainties from the EOS, which conventional methods fail to capture adequately.

Method: A novel framework using SBI to treat EOS uncertainties as intrinsic noise. The method involves assembling neutron star bulk properties from multiple EOS models, identifying optimal parameter combinations, and generating predictive distributions with uncertainty quantification.

Result: The discovery of a new universal relation linking neutron star radius to mass, fundamental mode, and a pressure mode. SBI outperforms traditional universal relations in prediction accuracy and reduces systematic errors.

Conclusion: SBI offers enhanced predictive capabilities and error mitigation for universal relations in neutron star studies, enabling more robust exploration of EOS uncertainties and calibrations to improve accuracy.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying, constructing, and validating precise and accurate universal relations for neutron star bulk quantities. A central element is simulation-based inference (SBI), which we adopt to treat uncertainties due to the unknown nuclear equation of state (EOS) as intrinsic non-trivial noise. By assembling a large set of bulk properties of non-rotating neutron stars across multiple state-of-the-art EOS models, we are able to systematically explore universal relations in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our framework further identifies the most promising parameter combinations, enabling a more focused and traditional construction of explicit universal relations. At the same time, SBI does not rely on explicit relations; instead, it directly provides predictive distributions together with a quantitative measure of systematic uncertainties, which are not captured by conventional approaches. As an example, we report a new universal relation that allows us to obtain the radius as a function of mass, fundamental mode, and one pressure mode. Our analysis shows that SBI can surpass the predictive power of this universal relation while also mitigating systematic errors. Finally, we demonstrate how universal relations can be further calibrated to mitigate systematic errors accurately.

### [12] [Observational Signatures of Accretion Disks around a Schwarzschild Black Hole in a Hernquist Dark Matter Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03980)
*Zhenglong Ban,Jing-Ya Zhao,Tian-You Ren,Yaobin Hua,Rong-Jia Yang parameter*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how a Hernquist-type dark matter halo affects gravitational wave emissions from orbital motions and the electromagnetic properties of accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole, showing measurable impacts on both phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the influence of dark matter halos on spacetime geometry near black holes and their observable effects through gravitational waves and electromagnetic emissions.

Method: Analysis of effective potentials for timelike geodesics, semi-analytical computation of orbital trajectories and gravitational waveforms, and generating images of accretion disks under varying observer inclinations.

Result: DM halos shift critical orbital parameters (MBO, ISCO) outward, alter gravitational wave zoom-whirl dynamics, and cause accretion disks to appear cooler and dimmer with altered flux distributions.

Conclusion: Dark matter halos leave distinct observable signatures in both gravitational and electromagnetic data, providing a multimessenger approach to study DM environments near black holes.

Abstract: We investigate how a Hernquist type dark matter (DM) halo, parametrized by its core radius $r_{s}$ and central density $ρ_{s}$, influences both the gravitational wave (GW) emission from timelike periodic orbits and the electromagnetic appearance of a thin accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics, we show that the DM halo shifts the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) outward, reflecting its modification of the spacetime geometry and the energy-angular momentum structure of particle motion. Employing a semi-analytical method, we compute orbital trajectories and the associated GW waveforms, revealing that the DM halo alters the characteristic zoom-whirl dynamics and induces measurable changes in waveform morphology. Furthermore, we generate direct and secondary images of the accretion disk across various observer inclinations and find that increasing $r_{s}$ or $ρ_{s}$ results in cooler, dimmer disks with modified flux distributions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo imprints distinct signatures in both gravitational and electromagnetic observables, offering a multimessenger pathway to probe DM environments near BHs.

### [13] [Symmetries of cosmological perturbations: The residual low multipole ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04144)
*Jibril Ben Achour,Etera Livine,Vincent Vennin*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper extends large-gauge transformations (LGTs) in cosmology to local symmetries, identifies new soft modes affecting cosmological observables, and shows adiabatic perturbations preserve Killing symmetries, linking them to algebraically-special Petrov-type O spacetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguities in cosmological-frame interpretations and explore symmetries preserving spacetime structures under long-wavelength perturbations.

Method: Revisiting LGTs, extending global symmetries to local ones with arbitrary time-dependent generators; analyzing symmetries of adiabatic perturbations via Killing vectors and tensor structures.

Result: 1. Local infinite-dimensional LGTs generate soft modes altering curvature and angular momentum. 2. Adiabatic perturbations preserve background symmetries, classified as Petrov-type O with conformal isometries.

Conclusion: Long-wavelength modes require fixing frame ambiguities before observations and provide an analytical framework for studying cosmological observables via symmetry preservation.

Abstract: In cosmology, long-wavelength modes are related to large-gauge transformations (LGT), i.e. changes of coordinates that modify the physical geometry of the cosmological patch. These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner.

### [14] [Parity-violating Dark Photon Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04145)
*Stephon Alexander,Lawrence Edmond,Cooper Niu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mechanism to form gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era via tachyonic instability of axion oscillations, leading to chiral substructures and potential seeds for supermassive black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the formation of dark photon halos and their role in early universe structure formation, particularly addressing the origin of supermassive black hole seeds.

Method: The mechanism involves coupling an ultralight axion field to dark photons via a Chern-Simons term, inducing tachyonic instabilities in axion oscillations which produce dark photons with net helicity, causing metric vorticity and halo collapse.

Result: Dark photon halos with masses from 10^5 to 10^11 solar masses and sizes from 1 to 10^6 parsecs form through this process, with vorticity enabling efficient angular momentum transport.

Conclusion: This mechanism provides a viable pathway for early universe halo formation and the creation of primordial seeds necessary for supermassive black hole formation in the early cosmos.

Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era. Coupled to an ultralight axion field through a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, dark photons can be produced by the tachyonic instability of axion coherent oscillation. The dark photons with a net helicity lead to a metric vorticity and can generate chiral substructures. For axion masses in the range $10^{-28} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$, the resulting inhomogeneities collapse to form halos with masses spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, with halo sizes ranging from $O(1)$ to $O(10^{6}) \, \mathrm{pc}$. During halo collapse, the induced vorticity could mediate efficient angular-momentum transport, which enables monolithic collapse and provides primordial seeds for the early formation of supermassive black holes.

### [15] [Obstructions to global visibility of singularities in asymptotically flat spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04152)
*Kanabar Jay,Kharanshu N. Solanki,Pankaj S. Joshi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the geodesic structure of asymptotically flat spacetimes under the null energy condition, using a twist-free Raychaudhuri equation framework. It introduces criteria based on differential equations techniques to determine the existence of conjugate points along null generators, ultimately establishing an obstruction to the global visibility of singular boundaries in such spacetimes.


<details>

Motivation: To understand under what conditions a singular boundary in spacetime is not globally visible, the authors aim to find criteria that prevent null geodesics from reaching null infinity. This study is motivated by the need to characterize spacetime trapping phenomena and their implications for global structures, particularly in gravitational collapse scenarios.

Method: The work employs the Raychaudhuri equation for twist-free null geodesic congruences, transformed into a Sturm-type ODE via Jacobi-map volume rescaling. The analysis involves two main criteria: (i) a Volterra identity combined with concavity to establish an integral inequality barrier, and (ii) Sturm comparison and Prüfer-angle methods to assess disconjugacy failure. These are applied to the Jacobi field equation to derive necessary conditions for focal points causing the conjugate locus obstruction.

Result: The authors prove that non-vanishing solutions of the transformed ODE cannot be disconjugate on intervals where the integral of sqrt(f/m) exceeds π. This condition ensures the existence of conjugate points along generators, forcing their termination before reaching null infinity. Consequently, regions of spacetime become causally unreachable from the singular boundary, implying non-visibility of S. Application to Christodoulou's scalar field collapse demonstrates feasibility.

Conclusion: This framework provides a generator-level mathematical obstruction preventing null geodesics from escaping singular regions under specified energy conditions. It advances the understanding of strong cosmic censorship and gravitational collapse by establishing conditions under which singularities remain causally isolated, supporting the idea that such obstructions are intrinsic geometric properties enforceable via differential inequalities.

Abstract: Consider an $(N+1)$-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime and a future-directed, affinely parametrized outgoing null generator $γ$ of an achronal boundary $\partial J^+(S_\varepsilon)$, where $\{S_\varepsilon\}$ is a nested family of smooth compact codimension $2$ surfaces approaching a singular boundary set $S$ in the past. In the twist-free case and under the null energy condition, the Raychaudhuri equation on the $m:=N-1$ dimensional screen bundle reads, $$ θ'=-\frac1mθ^2-\|σ\|^2-\mathrm{Ric}(k,k), $$ where $k$ is the tangent to $γ$. This equation linearizes, via the rescaling $u:=A^{1/m}$ with $A := |\det D|$ the Jacobi-map $m$-volume, to the Sturm-type ODE $$ u''+\frac1m f\,u=0,\qquad f:=\|σ\|^2+\mathrm{Ric}(k,k)\ge 0. $$ We develop two purely generator-wise criteria forcing a first zero of $u$: (i) an exact Volterra identity combined with concavity leads to a barrier-weighted integral inequality, and (ii) Sturm comparison and a Prüfer-angle estimate yields failure of disconjugacy whenever $\int_c^d \sqrt{f/m}\,dλ>π$ on a subinterval. We prove that $u(λ_\ast)=0$ is equivalent to the existence of a focal (conjugate) point and implies $θ= m u'/u\to-\infty$ at $λ_\ast$. Using the standard structure of achronal boundaries, this yields a geodesic-wise obstruction: if every generator that could reach $\mathscr I^+$ satisfies one of the above conditions in the regular spacetime region, then $J^+(S_\varepsilon)\cap \mathscr I^+=\emptyset$, and hence $S$ is not globally visible. As an application, we illustrate one of these criteria in the Einstein-massless scalar field collapse model of Christodoulou.

### [16] [Simulation-Based Prediction of Black Hole Spectra: From $10M_\odot$ to $10^8 M_\odot$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03349)
*Chris Nagele,Julian H. Krolik,Rongrong Liu,Brooks E. Kinch,Jeremy D. Schnittman*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper extends a radiation post-processing method to model black hole accretion spectra for black holes ranging from 10 to 10^8 solar masses, demonstrating agreement with observed X-ray states and explaining a soft X-ray excess in massive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in predicting observed spectra from luminous black hole systems and validate the applicability of their radiation modeling method across a wide mass range.

Method: Using GRMHD simulations with post-processing that incorporates relativistic Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and 30 elements' ionization states, extended to 10^8 solar mass black holes with sub-Eddington accretion rates and high spin.

Result: Produced spectra matching observed X-ray states (low-hard/steep power law for stellar-mass; power-law continua in massive systems) and identified an inverse Compton mechanism for soft X-ray excess in intermediate mass black holes.

Conclusion: Standard radiation physics applied to GRMHD data can successfully reproduce observed black hole accretion properties across masses, supporting the method's validity and offering insights into spectral features.

Abstract: It has long been thought that black hole accretion flows are driven by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and there are now many general relativistic global simulations illustrating the dynamics of this process. However, many challenges must be overcome in order to predict observed spectra from luminous systems. Ensuring energy conservation, local thermal balance, and local ionization equilibrium, our post-processing method incorporates all the most relevant radiation mechanisms: relativistic Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and lines and edges for 30 elements and all their ions. Previous work with this method was restricted to black holes of $10 M_\odot$; here, for the first time, we extend it to $10^8 M_\odot$ and present results for two sub-Eddington accretion rates and black hole spin parameter 0.9. The spectral shape predicted for stellar-mass black holes matches the low-hard state for the lower accretion rate and the steep power law state for the higher accretion rate. For high black hole mass, both accretion rates yield power-law continua from $\sim 0.5 - 50$~keV whose X-ray slopes agree well with observations. For intermediate mass black holes, we find a soft X-ray excess created by inverse Compton scattering of low-energy photons produced in the thermal part of the disk; this mechanism may be relevant to the soft X-ray excess commonly seen in massive black holes. Thus, our results show that standard radiation physics applied to GRMHD simulation data can yield spectra reproducing a number of the observed properties of accreting black holes across the mass spectrum.

### [17] [Multiwavelength Modeling of the Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2024wpp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03372)
*Conor M. B. Omand,Nikhil Sarin,Gavin P. Lamb,Daniel A. Perley,Andrew Mummery,Hamid Hamidani,Steve Schulze,Emma R. Beasor,Aleksandra Bochenek,Helena-Margaret S. Grabham,Sorcha R. Kennelly,Nguyen M. Khang,Shiho Kobayashi,Genevieve Schroeder,William N. Stone,Cairns Turnbull,Jacob Wise*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the most luminous LFBOT, AT2024wpp, by comparing its multiwavelength data to various proposed models like engine-driven supernovae, interaction-powered systems, and tidal disruption events (TDEs). None of the models fully explain the observations, but a TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole and a low-mass star, combined with a synchrotron blast wave, is favored. The authors suggest further observations to test this hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LFBOTs remain poorly understood due to their peculiar properties and uncertain energy sources. AT2024wpp's extreme luminosity and comprehensive multiwavelength data provide a critical case to constrain or rule out existing models.

Method: The authors fit optical, radio, and X-ray light curves of AT2024wpp with theoretical models from different scenarios (engine-driven SNe, interaction-powered SNe, TDEs, etc.), assessing their ability to reproduce all observed data phases.

Result: No single model satisfactorily explains all observed features. However, arguments favoring a TDE involving an IMBH and low-mass star combined with synchrotron emission show the most promise. Key issues include discrepancies in X-ray and early-time light curve fits.

Conclusion: While no model perfectly matches all data, the IMBH TDE with a synchrotron blast wave is the most plausible explanation. Future observations targeting late-time behavior and spectral details could confirm this model or require new paradigms for LFBOTs.

Abstract: Luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) are a growing class of enigmatic energetic transients. They show fast rises and declines, high temperatures throughout their evolution, and non-thermal emission in radio and X-rays. Their power source is currently unknown, but proposed models include engine-driven supernovae, interaction-powered supernovae, shock cooling emission, intermediate mass black hole tidal disruption events (IMBH TDEs), and Wolf-Rayet/black hole mergers, among others. AT2024wpp is the most optically luminous LFBOT to date and has been observed extensively at multiple wavelengths, including radio, optical, UV, and X-rays. We take models from multiple scenarios and fit them to the AT2024wpp optical, radio, and X-ray light curves to determine if which of these scenarios can best describe all aspects of the data. We show that none of the multiwavelength light curve models can reasonably explain the data, although other physical arguments favour a stellar mass/IMBH TDE of a low mass star and a synchrotron blast wave. We discuss how this scenario can be tested with late-time observations, and what other scenarios could possibly explain the broadband data.

### [18] [Late-Time Infrared Cooling in Magnetar-Driven Supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03373)
*Conor M. B. Omand*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper explores how supernova cooling transitions from optical to infrared over time, driven by a magnetar engine's PWN. Key findings include infrared lines like [Ne II] 12.8μm becoming dominant coolants by 6 years, influenced by PWN luminosity and ejecta mass, with implications for JWST observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the late-time cooling mechanisms and spectral signatures of supernovae powered by magnetar engines, particularly the role of infrared emission from PWN photoionization.

Method: Modeling the cooling contributions from optical and infrared transitions in supernova ejecta, considering parameters like PWN luminosity, ejecta mass, and photon energy. Simulated line emissions over time post-explosion.

Result: Infrared cooling (e.g., [Ne II] 12.8μm) dominates by ~6 years, especially when PWN luminosity drops below 10^40 erg/s. Optical cooling declines after 3 years; higher ejecta mass and lower PWN photon energy enhance infrared dominance. [Ne II] strength correlates with PWN luminosity and ejecta mass.

Conclusion: Infrared spectroscopy (e.g., via JWST) is crucial for studying late-phase supernovae. Magnetar-powered events with strong infrared emission and radio activity can be identified, aiding in constraining engine properties and observational strategies.

Abstract: A central magnetar engine is commonly invoked to explain energetic supernovae, which should have multiple signals in multiwavelength emission. Photoionization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can create distinct spectroscopic signals in the nebular phase. Recent models suggest infrared emission, particularly from Ne II, can be prominent at late times. This work examines the cooling power of optical and infrared transitions to determine which lines contribute strongly to cooling and on what timescale. The models show infrared cooling becomes strong at $\sim$ 3 years post-explosion and dominates by 6 years, with [Ne II] 12.8$μ$m being the strongest coolant. The fraction of total cooling in the infrared increases sharply once the PWN luminosity decreases below 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and this fraction also increases with increasing ejecta mass and decreasing average PWN photon energy. However, the emission from [Ne II] 12.8$μ$m increases with increasing PWN luminosity and increasing ejecta mass. Cooling at 1 year is dominated by optical O and S lines, with infrared Ar, Ni, and Ne lines becoming strong at 3 years. Optical cooling is almost negligible at 6 years, with the supernova cooling almost entirely through mid- and far-infrared transitions. JWST spectroscopy with MIRI should be able to detect these lines out to $z \sim 0.1$. Supernovae with higher magnetic fields transition to infrared cooling on earlier timescales, while infrared-dominated supernovae should have strong emission from neutral atoms and emit strongly in radio at sub-decade timescales.

### [19] [The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical merger rate may cause the $z$-$χ_{\rm eff}$ correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03456)
*Amanda M. Farah,Aditya Vijaykumar,Maya Fishbach*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper identifies a subpopulation of merging black holes in dense star clusters with specific mass and spin characteristics, suggesting these originate from hierarchical mergers. It also finds that the rate of such hierarchical mergers increases with redshift, implying the existence of massive, compact clusters in the early universe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether gravitational-wave data supports the existence of black holes formed via hierarchical mergers and to understand their astrophysical implications.

Method: Analyze gravitational-wave observations using the predicted spin magnitude (χ≈0.69) of hierarchically merged black holes. The method includes statistical analysis of mass distributions, spin tilts, and redshift evolution.

Result: A subpopulation with primary mass peaking at ~16.7 M_sun, secondary mass ~8.0 M_sun, isotropic spin tilts, and a higher hierarchical merger rate at higher redshifts (z=1 vs z=0.1). Secondary mass distribution hints at isolated binary evolution. Redshift evolution of hierarchical mergers explains observed spin distribution broadening.

Conclusion: Hierarchical mergers contribute significantly to observed black hole binaries, especially at higher redshifts. This suggests a population of massive, compact star clusters in the early universe. Further, isolated binary evolution may be needed alongside hierarchical processes to fully explain the data.

Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $χ\approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.

### [20] [Characteristics of the High-frequency Humps in the Black hole X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8--1613](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03696)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the high-frequency humps in Swift J1727.8--1613's X-ray power spectrum using Insight-HXMT data. The humps' frequencies rise up to ~30 keV and plateau beyond, with increasing fractional rms and soft lags. The results suggest a near-horizon black hole corona origin and constrain the black hole mass (2.84-120.01 solar masses) and spin (0.14-0.43) using relativistic precession models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin of the high-frequency humps in the power density spectrum and constrain astrophysical parameters (mass and spin) of the black hole in Swift J1727.8--1613.

Method: 1. Analyzed timing characteristics (frequencies, rms, lags) of high-frequency humps using Insight-HXMT data across 10-100 keV. 2. Applied relativistic precession model to the triplet of type-C QPO and two humps. 3. Compared results from full-energy and high-energy band datasets.

Result: Observed energy-dependent frequency behavior and soft lags in humps. Derived mass constraints as 2.84-120.01 M☉ (full energy), 2.84-13.98 M☉ (high-energy); spin constraints as 0.14-0.43 (full energy), 0.14-0.40 (high-energy).

Conclusion: The humps likely originate from near the black hole's innermost regions. The tighter constraints highlight the importance of high-energy data stability for accurate parameter estimation in relativistic models.

Abstract: We present a detailed timing analysis of the two high-frequency humps observed in the power density spectrum of Swift J1727.8--1613 up to 100 keV, using data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). Our analysis reveals that the characteristic frequencies of the humps increase with energy up to $\sim30$ keV, followed by a plateau at higher energies. The fractional rms amplitudes of the humps increase with energy, reaching approximately 15\% in the 50-100 keV band. The lag spectrum of the hump is characterized primarily by a soft lag that varies with energy. Our results suggest that the high-frequency humps originate from a corona close to the black hole. Additionally, by applying the relativistic precession model, we constrain the mass of Swift J1727.8--1613 to $2.84 < M / M_{\odot} < 120.01$ and the spin to $0.14 < a < 0.43$ from the full-energy band dataset, using triplets composed of a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation and two high-frequency humps. When considering only the high-energy bands with stable characteristic frequencies, we derive additional constraints of $2.84 < M/M_{\odot} < 13.98$ and $0.14 < a < 0.40$.

### [21] [Short gamma-ray burst progenitors have short delay times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03861)
*Matteo Pracchia,Om Sharan Salafia*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) to determine their delay time distribution (DTD) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, finding shorter average delays (10-800 Myr) compared to previous studies, which the authors attribute to improper handling of selection effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if SGRBs exhibit a delay time distribution distinct from the cosmic star formation history, potentially revealing insights into BNS merger dynamics and progenitor evolution.

Method: The analysis employs a hierarchical Bayesian approach on a large SGRB sample, modeling DTD as power-law or log-normal distributions and considering two luminosity models (ELF with doubly broken power-law, QUSJ-based).

Result: Results show average delay times of 10-800 Myr with minimum delay ≤350 Myr, contradicting prior findings of Gyr-scale delays. Incorrect selection effect treatment in earlier studies is identified as the source of discrepancy.

Conclusion: SGRBs' DTD indicates shorter merger delays than previously thought, suggesting improved methods account for selection biases, aligning more closely with BNS merger expectations from stellar evolution models.

Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be primarily associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The SGRB population can therefore be scrutinized to look for signatures of the delay time between the formation of the progenitor massive star binary and the eventual merger, which could produce an evolution of the cosmic rate density of such events whose shape departs from that of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH). To that purpose, we study a large sample of SGRBs within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a particular focus on the delay time distribution (DTD) of the population. Following previous studies, we model the DTD either as a power-law with a minimum time delay or as a log-normal function. We consider two models for the intrinsic SGRB luminosity distribution: an empirical luminosity function (ELF) with a doubly broken power-law shape, and one based on a quasi-universal structured jet (QUSJ) model. Regardless of the chosen parametrization, we find average time delays $10\lesssim \langle τ_\mathrm{d}\mathrm\rangle/\mathrm{Myr}\lesssim 800$ and a minimum delay time $τ_\mathrm{d,min}\lesssim 350\,\mathrm{Myr}$, in contrast with previous studies that found long delay times of few Gyr. We demonstrate that the cause of the longer inferred time delays in past studies most likely resides in an incorrect treatment of selection effects.

TL;DR: TON 0599 (z=0.7247) is a distant FSRQ detected in VHE gamma rays using MAGIC, showing a 50% Crab flux peak. The spectrum's cutoff suggests emission beyond the broad line region. Multiwavelength observations reveal correlated flux variations, modeled via EC scattering of dusty torus photons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the VHE gamma-ray emission mechanisms and spatial localization in distant FSRQs through the study of TON 0599, leveraging simultaneous multiwavelength data to constraint emission models.

Method: Observations with MAGIC (VHE gamma rays), Fermi-LAT (high energy gamma rays), Swift (X-ray, optical-UV), WEBT (optical-NIR-radio) and modeling with a one-zone leptonic model involving EC scattering.

Result: Detection of VHE emission up to ~50 GeV with a spectral cutoff, correlated multiwavelength flaring activity, and successful modeling attributing high-energy peak to EC of dusty torus photons.

Conclusion: TON 0599's VHE emission originates from beyond the broad line region, and EC processes dominate the high-energy peak. The study supports one-zone leptonic models and provides insights into emission mechanisms in distant blazars.

Abstract: TON 0599 (z=0.7247) belongs to the few flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) detected in the very high energy (VHE, $E > 100$ GeV) gamma-ray band. Its redshift makes it currently one of the farthest VHE gamma-ray sources. It was detected for the first time with the MAGIC telescopes on 2017 December 15, and observed until December 29. The flux reached a maximum of about 50 per cent of the Crab Nebula flux above 80 GeV on the second night of observation, after which we witnessed a gradual decrease of the flux. The VHE gamma-ray spectrum connects smoothly to the one in the high energy ($E > 100$ MeV) band obtained from simultaneous observations with Fermi-LAT. It features a cut-off at energies around 50 GeV, indicating the location of the gamma-ray emission zone beyond the broad line region. In addition, we were able to follow the spectral evolution during the fading phase of the flare. Multiwavelength analysis based on observations in optical, near-infrared, and radio bands acquired by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration from November to March, as well as observations in X-ray and optical$-$UV bands with instruments on board the Swift satellite, shows strong correlation between different bands. We model the broadband emission with a simple one-zone leptonic model, where the high-energy peak is predominantly produced by external Compton (EC) scattering of photons from the dusty torus.

### [23] [Search for gamma-ray variability around Fermi-LAT pulsar glitches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03939)
*Giovanni Cozzolongo,Alessio Fiori,Massimiliano Razzano,Pablo M. Saz Parkinson*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study analyzed gamma-ray emission variability in pulsars correlated with glitches using Fermi-LAT data. Despite tracking rotational and emission changes post-glitches, no significant flux variations were detected in most cases except PSR J2021+4026, which uniquely shows quasiperiodic switches. The Vela pulsar exhibited a 0.5% flux change upper limit. Further studies are needed to understand glitch mechanisms and emission connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the relationship between pulsar glitches (sudden rotational changes) and associated gamma-ray emission variability. This is driven by the unique behavior of PSR J2021+4026, which shows regular spin-down rate and emission state switches, unlike other pulsars.

Method: The method involved a novel analysis of 14 years of Fermi-LAT data focusing on seven glitches. A binned likelihood spectral analysis was applied to data windows around glitch epochs, with improved parameter precision via diffuse background model weights and systematic error accounting.

Result: No significant flux/spectral variations were found across analyzed glitches except for PSR J2021+4026. The Vela pulsar showed a strict 0.5% upper limit on flux change. The correlation between glitches and gamma-ray emission remains uncertain, highlighting PSR J2021+4026's unique properties.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that glitches do not generally cause detectable gamma-ray flux changes, but PSR J2021+4026's behavior suggests unusual mechanisms. Comprehensive glitch studies are essential to better understand these phenomena and their impacts on emission dynamics.

Abstract: Pulsars are the most numerous class of Galactic gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Young pulsars occasionally experience sudden timing discontinuities called glitches, characterized by rapid changes in rotational parameters, usually followed by a return to regular rotation. PSR J2021+4026 is unique among Fermi-LAT pulsars, exhibiting quasiperiodic switches between two states with varying spin-down rates approximately every 3-4 years, correlated with sudden changes in gamma-ray emission features. This study searched for gamma-ray emission variability in pulsars correlated with glitch occurrence. We introduced a novel approach to analyzing LAT gamma-ray pulsars through systematic examination of variability associated with spin-down rate changes. We tracked rotation and gamma-ray emission changes for seven promising glitches selected based on observed spin-down rate variations. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data, we conducted binned likelihood spectral analysis of data windows around selected glitch epochs. We improved best-fit parameter precision by incorporating likelihood weights calculated from diffuse background models, accounting for systematic error contributions. The phase-averaged flux and spectral parameters of analyzed pulsars showed no significant variation across investigated glitches. The 95% upper limits on relative flux change indicate the Vela pulsar flux is unchanging, with a 0.5% upper limit on relative change, making it promising for further searches. The connection between glitch dynamics and gamma-ray emission remains unclear, and PSR J2021+4026 remains unique in its gamma-ray variability properties. We conclude that comprehensive investigation of glitches is warranted to further unravel their underlying mechanisms.

TL;DR: The study presents new radio observations of Sco X-1, revealing flares interpreted as ultra-relativistic jet launches and interactions, suggesting that high jet velocities cause emission beaming away from Earth, explaining detection gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the ultra-relativistic flows observed in Sco X-1 and why they sometimes go undetected, exploring the role of jet velocities and emission beaming.

Method: The team used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array for fast radio imaging at 10 and 15 GHz to observe Sco X-1, analyzing flare periods and their correlation with jet dynamics.

Result: Detected flares at 10/15 GHz are linked to fast jet launches (βΓ>2) interacting with slower ejecta. The observed flare intervals suggest high jet velocities cause emission beaming away from Earth, explaining non-detections.

Conclusion: Ultra-relativistic flows in Sco X-1 are plausibly explained by recurring fast jets whose emission is beamed out of our line of sight when velocities are sufficiently high.

Abstract: Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) is a neutron star X-ray binary in which the neutron star is accreting rapidly from a low mass stellar companion. At radio frequencies, Sco X-1 is highly luminous and has been observed to have jet ejecta moving at mildly relativistic velocities away from a radio core, which corresponds to the binary position. In this Letter, we present new radio observations of Sco X-1 taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Using a fast imaging method, we find that the 10 and 15GHz data show a number of flares. We interpret these flares as the possible launching of fast jets ($βΓ$>2), previously observed in Sco X-1 and called ultra-relativistic flows, and their interaction with slower moving jet ejecta. Using the period between successive flares, we find that it is possible for the fast jets to remain undetected, as a result of the fast jet velocity being sufficiently high to cause the jet emission to be beamed in the direction of the motion and out of our line of sight. Our findings demonstrate that the ultra-relativistic flows could be explained by the presence of fast jets in the Sco X-1 system.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using high-density, high-Z crystals with oriented lattice structures in space-based γ-ray telescopes to improve sensitivity and resolution by enhancing shower containment and enabling polarization measurements of γ-rays above a few GeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of current detectors by leveraging the unique properties of oriented crystals to increase interaction cross-sections and enable polarization studies, which are critical for astrophysical research and dark matter searches.

Method: Simulations and analysis of photon/e± interactions in oriented crystals, demonstrating angle-dependent cross-section enhancements and compact shower development. The study proposes an oriented tracker-converter system to exploit these effects.

Result: Results show oriented crystals allow more compact showers, better containment in smaller volumes, and enable polarization measurements of γ-rays at >few GeV, beyond the reach of existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed detector concept could significantly advance γ-ray astronomy by improving sensitivity, resolution, and enabling new observational capabilities, particularly in studying extreme astrophysical environments and indirect dark matter detection.

Abstract: High-density and high-Z crystals are a key element of most space-borne $γ$-ray telescopes operating at GeV energies (such as Fermi-LAT). The lattice structure is usually neglected in the development of a crystalline detector, although its effects on the energy deposit development should be taken into account, since the interactions of a high energy ($\sim$~GeV) photon or e$^\pm$ impinging along the axis of an oriented crystal are different than the ones observed in a fully isotropic medium. Specifically, if the angle between a photon (e$^\pm$) trajectory and the crystal axis is smaller than $\sim$ 0.1$^\circ$, a large enhancement of the pair production (bremsstrahlung) cross-section is observed. Consequently, a photon-induced shower inside an oriented crystal develops within a much more compact region than in an amorphous medium. Moreover, for photon energies above a few GeV and incidence angles up to several degrees, the pair-production cross-section exhibits a pronounced dependence on the angle between the crystal axis and the photon polarization vector. \\ In this work we show that these effects could be exploited to develop a novel class of light-weight pointing space-borne $γ$-ray telescopes, capable of achieving an improved sensitivity and resolution, thanks to a better shower containment in a smaller volume with respect to non-oriented crystalline detectors. We also show that an oriented tracker-converter system could be used to measure the polarization of a $γ$-ray source above few GeV, in a regime that remains unexplorable through any other detection technique. This novel detector concept could open new pathways in the study of the physics of extreme astrophysical environments and potentially improve the detector sensitivity for indirect Dark Matter searches in space.

### [26] [Implications of Non-equatorial Relativistic Accretion Flows for Ultra-Fast Inflows in AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04141)
*Keigo Fukumura,Alessandro Peca,Roberto Serafinelli,Mauro Dadina*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper proposes that ultra-fast inflows (UFIs) in AGNs can be identified with weakly-magnetized hydrodynamic accretion flows guided by poloidal magnetic fields at low-to-mid latitudes above the equatorial disk. Using general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) in Kerr spacetime, simulations show that such flows with velocities ~0.1c at ~100 Schwarzschild radii can reproduce observed UFI characteristics like column densities and ionization parameters seen in NuSTAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observed X-ray signatures of UFIs in AGNs motivate the need to understand their physical origin. Existing models require explanation of how these high-velocity flows (接近光速的0.1倍) with specific column densities and ionization parameters form and behave near supermassive black holes.

Method: The study employs GRHD simulations under the weak-field approximation in Kerr spacetime to model accretion flows above the equatorial plane. Numerical calculations focus on flow kinematics, density distributions, and their spectral signatures, aiming to replicate redshifted absorption line observations.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that weakly-magnetized GRHD accretion flows at low latitudes can produce observed UFI features: velocities ~0.1c within ~100 Schwarzschild radii, column densities N_H ~10^23 cm^-2, and ionization parameters log(ξ) ~3, consistent with NuSTAR data.

Conclusion: The identified accretion flow configuration provides a plausible physical basis for interpreting UFI observations. This bridges theoretical accretion models with empirical data, suggesting that UFIs are not standalone features but part of structured accretion processes influenced by magnetic fields in relativistic environments.

Abstract: Motivated by a number of X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that exhibit a potential signature of ultra-fast inflows (UFIs), we consider in this work a scenario that UFIs can be physically identified as weakly-magnetized hydrodynamic accretion flows that is guided and channeled by poloidal magnetic field into low-to-mid latitude above the equatorial disk. In the context of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) under a weak-field limit in Kerr spacetime, we present a set of preliminary results by numerically calculating the physical property of GRHD flows (e.g. kinematics and density distribution) in an effort to simulate redshifted absorption line spectra. Our model demonstrates that such GRHD accretion off the equatorial plane (i.e. $v \gsim 0.1c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in the vicinity of AGN closer than $\sim 100$ \sw radii) can manifest itself as UFIs in the form of redshifted absorption signature assuming the observed characteristics such as column density of $N_H \sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization parameter of $\log (ξ\rm{[erg~cm~s^{-1}])} \sim 3$ as also seen in recent multi-epoch {\it NuSTAR} observations among other data.

TL;DR: The discovery of SN Eos, a strongly lensed Type II supernova at z=5.133, provides the first direct evidence of massive star formation in a metal-poor environment in the early Universe. This magnified observation highlights the potential of gravitational lensing to study high-redshift stellar processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study early Universe stellar evolution and supernovae at z>3, overcoming observational challenges caused by distance and redshift through gravitational lensing. The aim is to understand star formation and galaxy evolution in the first billion years after the Big Bang.

Method: Combining archival HST rest-frame UV data with JWST spectroscopy to detect and analyze SN Eos. Gravitational lensing magnification allowed observation of a multiply-imaged SN in a distant galaxy, enabling study of its shock breakout and progenitor metallicity.

Result: SN Eos is a z=5.133 Type II SN in a Lyman-α emitting galaxy, with progenitor metallicity ≤0.1 Z☉. JWST data shows UV emission from early explosion phases, confirming direct evidence of massive stars forming in metal-poor environments during reionization.

Conclusion: Gravitational lensing enables detection of otherwise undetectable high-z SNe, offering insights into early star formation and metallicity. Future such discoveries could constrain the faint end of cosmic star-formation rate density in the early Universe.

Abstract: Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z > 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting. To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of "SN Eos": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-α emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300Å) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (<= 0.1 Z_{\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of GRB 180728A and its associated supernova SN 2018fip reveals insights into the diversity of energy partition between GRBs and SNe, as well as the importance of asymmetries and two-component ejecta in collapsar events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unique properties of the highly energetic low-redshift GRB 180728A and its connection to the supernova SN 2018fip, exploring how their characteristics compare to other GRB-SN events and challenging existing models on energy partition and ejecta dynamics.

Method: Dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and SN over 80 days, image subtraction to mitigate light contamination from a nearby star, and multi-component modeling of both the prompt emission and SN light curves/spectra.

Result: GRB 180728A exhibits one of the highest energies at z < 0.2, but its afterglow is surprisingly dim. The SN's light curve dominates early due to the faint afterglow, and spectral analysis suggests a two-component ejecta (high-velocity collimated and low-velocity massive components). The SN's kinetic energy is atypical, not aligning with the GRB's high energy output.

Conclusion: Asymmetries and multi-component ejecta structures are critical for explaining GRB-SN diversity. The mismatch between GRB and SN energies underscores variability in how explosion energy is partitioned between prompt emission and supernova, suggesting current models require updates to incorporate such heterogeneity.

Abstract: The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.

### [29] [The maximum mass ratio of hierarchical mergers may cause the $q$-$χ_{\rm eff}$ correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03457)
*Aditya Vijaykumar,Amanda M. Farah,Maya Fishbach*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study identifies a subpopulation of binary black hole mergers consistent with hierarchical mergers, characterized by mass ratios below ~0.59 and remnant spins of ~0.69, explaining the narrowing of spin distributions observed in prior studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the presence of hierarchical mergers (second generation BHs merging with first generation BHs) in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog and explain the observed narrowing of effective inspiral spin distributions with mass ratio.

Method: Analyzing BBH merger data from the latest detector catalog, the authors identified a subpopulation with primary spins indicative of hierarchical mergers. They constrained mass ratios using astrophysical expectations and inferred the fraction of this subpopulation.

Result: Found that this subpopulation has mass ratios below 0.59 and that 19-88% of BBHs below this ratio belong to the hierarchically-merged population. This explains the observed narrowing of spin distributions.

Conclusion: Hierarchical mergers significantly contribute to the observed BBH population, providing a natural explanation for the spin distribution trend and supporting models of second-generation BHs forming through successive mergers.

Abstract: Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population. Our results offer a natural explanation for the narrowing of the effective inspiral spin distribution with mass ratio observed in other studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for scientific digital assistants that handle technical data accurately, operate in secure networks, and provide precise citations.

Method: MARVEL uses a combination of fast query paths and DeepSearch mode with retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores subqueries, allocates resources effectively, and maintains an evidence ledger.

Result: On surrogate datasets, MARVEL matches GPT-4o on literature queries and outperforms it on domain-specific detector operations tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of its domain retrieval and guided reasoning approach.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants by releasing all components and datasets openly.

Abstract: We present MARVEL (https://ligogpt.mit.edu/marvel), a locally deployable, open-source framework for domain-aware question answering and assisted scientific research. It is designed to address the increasing demands of a digital assistant for scientific groups that can read highly technical data, cite precisely, and operate within authenticated networks. MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive. By making the complete framework and evaluation datasets openly available, we aim to provide a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper addresses contamination from spacecraft emissions and charging in thermal electron measurements using the Solar Orbiter's SWA-EAS instrument. Simulations reveal that cold electron emissions from distant spacecraft surfaces cause contamination above the potential energy threshold, differing from expectations. The study highlights the complex contributions of multiple contamination sources under varying plasma conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate spacecraft-induced errors in thermal electron measurements, understand the sources and mechanisms of cold electron contamination, and validate simulation models against real SWA-EAS data.

Method: Used numerical simulations with SPIS software to model Solar Orbiter's interaction with solar wind. Implemented a virtual SWA-EAS detector to generate simulated electron spectra, comparing them with real data under 0.3 AU conditions.

Result: Found agreement between simulated and observed spectra, identified distant spacecraft surfaces as the source of contamination above the potential threshold, noted discrepancies in spectrum break positions suggesting real detector potential deviations from measured spacecraft potential.

Conclusion: Complex contamination dynamics require considering multiple emission sources and potential variations. Simulations aid in interpreting SWA-EAS data and improving instrument models for future missions.

Abstract: Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAST-P, a wide-field optical polarimeter array designed for high-cadence polarization monitoring of astrophysical transients and surveys, enabling studies of transient phenomena and extensive polarization catalogs with high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruments have small fields of view, limiting wide surveys. LAST-P addresses this by enabling large-area, rapid polarization observations crucial for capturing transient events and detailed interstellar medium studies.

Method: LAST-P uses an array design with 88.8 deg² FoV, 15 x 1-minute exposures, achieving polarization measurements for faint sources (Bp ~20.9). It proposes three survey strategies, including AGN monitoring with <1-day cadence. Sensitivity and precision calculations (0.7-3.5% PD) are provided for different magnitudes.

Result: The instrument will produce polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries, white dwarfs, and interstellar medium studies, with capability to monitor transients like GRBs and SNe at early phases. AGN monitoring of ~200 objects at high cadence is feasible.

Conclusion: LAST-P will significantly advance studies of transient polarization, magnetic fields, and dust properties in astrophysical sources by overcoming FoV and cadence limitations of existing instruments.

Abstract: Optical polarimetry provides information on the geometry of the emitting region, the magnetic field configuration and the properties of dust in astrophysical sources. Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg$^2$. With a 15 x 1-minute exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude $\sim$20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree (PD) will reach 0.7\%, 1.5\%, and 3.5\% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2.7 arcsec, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations. We propose three distinct non-simultaneous survey strategies, among them an active galactic nuclei (AGN) strategy for long-term monitoring of $\sim$200 AGN with $<$1-day cadence. In this paper, we present the predicted sensitivity of the instrument and outline the various science cases it is designed to explore.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study identifies a polarization rotation systematic in CMB telescopes caused by differential AR coating transmission, quantifies its impact using a hybrid physical optics method, and emphasizes the need for analytical correction to avoid observational biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential systematic errors in CMB measurements caused by optical components' AR coatings, which could lead to misinterpretations of polarization data.

Method: Developed a hybrid physical optics approach combining full-wave EM simulations of AR coatings with refractive system modeling to analyze polarization response.

Result: Demonstrated that non-ideal AR coatings in a two-lens telescope induce 0.05-0.5 degree polarization angle rotation across the focal plane, causing temperature-to-polarization leakage and Q/U mixing.

Conclusion: Failure to correct for this effect can introduce significant biases in CMB polarization analysis, necessitating improved coating standards and analytical mitigation strategies.

Abstract: We identify a polarization rotation systematic in the far field beams of refractive cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes caused by differential transmission in anti-reflection (AR) coatings of optical elements. This systematic was identified following the development of a hybrid physical optics method that incorporates full-wave electromagnetic simulations of AR coatings to model the full polarization response of refractive systems. Applying this method to a two-lens CMB telescope with non-ideal AR coating, we show that polarization-dependent transmission can produce a rotation of the far-field polarization angle that varies across the focal plane with a typical amplitude of 0.05-0.5 degrees. If ignored in analysis, this effect can produce temperature to polarization leakage and Stokes Q/U mixing.

*Gregory Hellbourg*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper explores the viability of Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) for passive radio services, proposing JITQZ and hybrid frameworks while emphasizing the necessity of static allocations and stringent safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if DSS can benefit passive services like radio astronomy without compromising their vulnerability to interference, addressing concerns about new failure modes and enforcement challenges.

Method: Proposes JITQZ for critical observations, hybrid frameworks combining static and dynamic access, and uses game theory to analyze cooperation and incentive mechanisms like pseudonymity-based attribution.

Result: Non-cooperative sharing fails; cooperation requires specific conditions. DSS is viable only as a high-reliability system with strict safeguards and accountability.

Conclusion: Static spectrum allocations remain crucial. Dynamic access must have conservative measures and enforceable compliance mechanisms to protect passive services.

Abstract: Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) is increasingly promoted as a key element of modern spectrum policy, driven by the rising demand from commercial wireless systems and advances in spectrum access technologies. Passive radio sciences, including radio astronomy, Earth remote sensing, and meteorology, operate under fundamentally different constraints. They rely on exceptionally low interference spectrum and are highly vulnerable to even brief radio frequency interference. We examine whether DSS can benefit passive services or whether it introduces new failure modes and enforcement challenges. We propose just-in-time quiet zones (JITQZ) as a mechanism for protecting high value observations and assess hybrid frameworks that preserve static protection for core passive bands while allowing constrained dynamic access in adjacent frequencies. We analyze the roles of propagation uncertainty, electromagnetic compatibility constraints, and limited spectrum awareness. Using a game theoretic framework, we show why non-cooperative sharing fails, identify conditions for sustained cooperation, and examine incentive mechanisms including pseudonymetry-enabled attribution that promote compliance. We conclude that DSS can support passive radio sciences only as a high-reliability, safety-critical system. Static allocations remain essential, and dynamic access is viable only with conservative safeguards and enforceable accountability.

*Shaouly Bar-Shalom,Jose Wudka*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes using the approximate $b$-Parity quantum number to probe third-generation flavor-changing interactions at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). By analyzing single and di-jet events with $b$-jets, they show that $b_P=-1$ signals can detect new physics up to ~5 TeV, surpassing the EIC's energy by 30x, contingent on $b$-tagging efficiency and electron polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Standard Model (SM) predicts vanishingly small $b_P$-odd signals in single/di-jet production due to CKM suppression, making these channels ideal backgrounds for detecting new physics contributions violating $b_P$. This allows the EIC to search for flavor-changing interactions involving top/bottom quarks at scales beyond its nominal energy.

Method: They count $b$-jets in $e+p/A \to j + \not\!E_T$ and $2j + \not\!E_T$ processes at √s ~140 GeV. SM predicts $b_P=+1$ dominance, while new physics could generate observable $b_P=-1$ events. The main SM background is mistagged $b$-jets, so they optimize analysis using $b$-tagging efficiency and polarized electron beams.

Result: Single-jet channel can probe new physics up to Λ ~5 TeV, 30x higher than EIC's CM energy. Di-jet channel is less sensitive. Sensitivity depends on experimental factors like tagging purity and polarization.

Conclusion: $b$-Parity offers a simple yet powerful probe for new flavor physics at EIC. Maximizing $b$-tagging and utilizing polarized beams is crucial for achieving the predicted TeV-scale discovery potential.

Abstract: We employ an approximate conserved quantum number (defined as "$b$-Parity" in [1]) of the Standard Model (SM): $b_P=(-1)^n$, where $n$ is the number of produced $b$-jets in the reaction $e + p/A \to n \cdot j_b +X$, to explore new TeV-scale flavor-changing interactions involving the 3rd generation quarks at the EIC; simply by counting the number of $b$-jets in the final state. In particular, the SM single and di-jet production at the EIC which occur through charge current interactions, $e + p/A \to j + \!\not\!E_T$ and $e + p/A \to 2\cdot j + \!\not\!E_T$, are $b_P$-even since the $b_P$-violating (i.e, $b_P=-1$) SM signals for these processes are necessarily CKM suppressed and, therefore, have a vanishingly small production rate. In contrast, new flavor physics can generate $b_P=-1$ signals at the EIC whose only significant SM background is due to $b$-jet misidentification. We thus show that $b_P$ can be used as a simple and sensitive probe of new flavor violating physics; specifically, we find that counting single $b$-jet events in $e + p/A \to j + \!\not\!E_T$ at the EIC with a center-of-mass (CM) energy of $\sqrt{s} \sim 140$ GeV, can probe scales of new physics up to $Λ\sim {\cal O}(5)$ TeV for a certain type of new chiral flavor-changing physics in 3rd generation interactions. This is remarkably more than 30 times larger than the assumed EIC CM energy and it critically depends on the $b$-tagging efficiency and purity as well as the feasibility of electron-beam polarization. The sensitivity of the di-jet process, $e + p/A \to 2j + \!\not\!E_T$, to these type of new physics is reduced compared to the single-jet channel.

### [36] [Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter as a Probe of Inflationary Reheating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03346)
*James M. Cline,Yong Xu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes that cold sterile neutrino dark matter can be produced during reheating via inflaton decays with a tiny branching ratio, allowing parameters to evade X-ray constraints while matching the observed DM abundance. It maps viable parameter spaces and suggests future X-ray observations could probe reheating temperatures beyond current BBN bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain dark matter with sterile neutrinos, addressing how they can be produced in sufficient abundance without conflicting with X-ray observations, and linking DM properties to reheating parameters post-inflation.

Method: The authors analyze sterile neutrino production during reheating through inflaton decay branching ratios, calculate parameter spaces considering mixing angles, masses, and reheating temperatures, and assess future X-ray observational potential.

Result: Identifies viable parameter regions where small active-sterile mixing avoids X-ray constraints, establishes connections between DM properties and reheating parameters, and shows future X-ray data can set tighter reheating temperature limits.

Conclusion: Sterile neutrino DM production during reheating is a viable mechanism, offering a connection between cosmology phases (inflation/reheating) and dark matter, with future X-ray experiments promising to probe fundamental cosmological parameters.

Abstract: Sterile neutrinos offer a minimal and testable explanation for dark matter (DM), with their radiative decay actively searched for in X-ray observations. We show that cold sterile neutrino DM can be efficiently produced during reheating from inflaton decays with a tiny branching ratio, ${\rm BR}\lesssim 10^{-4}$. This production mechanism opens regions of parameter space where the active-sterile mixing is small enough to evade current X-ray constraints while reproducing the observed DM abundance. We systematically map the viable parameter space in terms of the sterile neutrino mass, mixing angle, inflaton mass, reheating temperature, and branching ratio. We further demonstrate that sterile neutrino DM can serve as a probe of inflationary reheating, with future X-ray observations capable of setting lower bounds on the reheating temperature several orders of magnitude above the existing bound from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

### [37] [Estimating JUNO's Sensitivity to Solar Neutrino-to-antineutrino Conversion and Neutrino Magnetic Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03502)
*C. V. Ventura,Saul J. Panibra Churata*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study assesses JUNO's sensitivity to solar neutrino-to-antineutrino conversion via spin-flavor precession, finding competitive constraints on the neutrino magnetic moment in high-energy ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate JUNO's ability to probe neutrino magnetic moment through SFP-induced antineutrino flux detection, aiming to compare with existing astrophysical limits.

Method: Used a sensitivity-based framework for counting experiments without prior observations to calculate 90% C.L. sensitivities for solar antineutrino fluxes in two energy windows (1.8-16.8 MeV and 8.0-16.8 MeV). Calculated magnetic moment constraints under assumed solar transverse magnetic fields (50kG, 100kG).

Result: In the full energy range, JUNO's constraints don't surpass prior experiments but outperform in the high-energy window (8-16.8 MeV) with flux limit φ_lim ≤4.01×10¹ cm⁻²s⁻¹ and P≤2.07×10⁻⁵. Magnetic moment sensitivities reach μν≤7.27×10⁻¹¹ μB (50kG) and μν≤3.64×10⁻¹¹ μB (100kG), rivaling top astrophysical limits.

Conclusion: JUNO can achieve competitive neutrino magnetic moment constraints in high-energy regions, with the 8.0-16.8 MeV window offering strong potential despite full-energy limitations from reactor backgrounds.

Abstract: We investigated JUNO's sensitivity to a possible conversion of solar neutrinos into antineutrinos via the spin-flavor precession (SFP) mechanism, and assessed the implications for constraining the neutrino-magnetic moment (NMM). Using a sensitivity-based framework appropriate for counting experiments with no prior observations, we derive 90\% C.L.\ ensemble-average sensitivities on the solar antineutrino flux for 1.8--16.8 MeV and 8.0--16.8 MeV. For the entire energy window, the results do not improve the restrictions of other experiments; the relevance occurs in the highes-energy window. In this window, we report a flux of $φ_{\mathrm{lim}}\le 4.01\times10^{1}\ \mathrm{cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ and a probability of $P_{ν_e\rightarrow\barν_e}\le 2.07\times10^{-5}$, the latter normalized to the ${}^8$B flux above threshold, $Φ_{\rm SSM}(E>8~\mathrm{MeV})$. Assuming transverse solar magnetic fields of $B_\perp=50$ and $100$~kG, the corresponding magnetic-moment sensitivities are $μ_ν\le 7.27\times10^{-11}\,μ_B$ and $3.64\times10^{-11}\,μ_B$ in the high-energy window. These results highlight that JUNO has the potential to achieve sensitivities comparable to the most stringent astrophysical limits; in particular, the high-energy selection (8.0--16.8~MeV) provides a sensitivity that is competitive with current results, while the full-energy window remains primarily limited by near-reactor backgrounds.

### [38] [Fully-strange tetraquarks: fall-apart decays and experimental candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03614)
*Feng-Xiao Liu,Xian-Hui Zhong,Qiang Zhao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Analyzes fall-apart decays of fully-strange tetraquark states, revealing narrow decay widths, and identifies potential experimental signatures for observed and predicted states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the decay properties of fully-strange tetraquarks and interpret newly observed states (like X(2300) and X(2500)) as candidates for specific theoretical tetraquark states.

Method: Systematic analysis of fall-apart decay widths for $1S$, $1P$, and $2S$-wave fully-strange tetraquark states using theoretical models, comparing predictions with experimental observations from BESIII.

Result: Most fully-strange tetraquarks exhibit narrow decay widths (~10 MeV). X(2300) aligns with $T_{(4s)1^{+-}}(2323)$ and X(2500) with $T_{(4s)0^{-+}}(2481)$. Proposed decay channels ($φφ$, $φφ(1680)$, etc.) for future experimental searches.

Conclusion: Experimental pursuit of proposed decay channels can validate theoretical tetraquark predictions and clarify the nature of observed states like X(2300) and X(2500).

Abstract: We presents a systematic analysis of the fall-apart decays for the $1S$, $1P$, and $2S$-wave fully-strange tetraquark states. It shows that most of the fully-strange tetraquark states have a relatively narrow fall-apart decay width of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV. The newly observed axial-vector state $X(2300)$ at BESIII may favor the low-lying $1S$-wave $1^{+-}$ state $T_{(4s)1^{+-}}(2323)$, while the $X(2500)$ resonance observed in the earlier BESIII experiment may favor the low-lying $1P$-wave $0^{-+}$ state $T_{(4s)0^{-+}}(2481)$. Some fully-strange tetraquark states predicted in theory can be searched for in their dominant fall-apart decay channels in experiment, such as $φφ$, $φφ(1680)$, $η^{(\prime)}φ$, $η^{(\prime)}h_1(1415)$, and $φf_2^{\prime}(1525)$, to which they have relatively large couplings.

### [39] [Role of $Σ(1660)$ in the $K^- p \toπ^0π^0Σ^0$ reaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03692)
*Xing-Yi Ji,Si-Wei Liu,Wen-Tao Lyu,De-Min Li,En Wang,Ju-Jun Xie*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates the processes of $K^-p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ and $K^-p \to \pi^0 \Lambda(1405)$ using an effective Lagrangian approach. The model includes a $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance ($J^P=1/2^+$) alongside background nucleon pole terms, which is essential for reproducing experimental data on total and differential cross sections. Results indicate that the $\Sigma(1660)$'s contributions are necessary and its properties can be constrained by the data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of $K^-p$ interactions producing $\pi^0$ mesons and hyperons, and to determine the necessity and properties of the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance through comparison with experimental data.

Method: An effective Lagrangian approach was used, incorporating contributions from a $u$-channel nucleon pole term (background) and the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance. Calculations included decay chains like $\Sigma(1660) \to \pi^0 \Lambda(1405)$ followed by $\Lambda(1405) \to \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ for the $K^-p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ reaction.

Result: The model successfully reproduces available experimental data for both reactions. The inclusion of the $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance was found to be critical for achieving agreement with measurements.

Conclusion: The $\Sigma(1660)$ resonance plays an indispensable role in explaining the observed cross sections, and experimental data can be used to further characterize its properties.

Abstract: The processes of $K^-p \to π^0 π^0 Σ^0$ and $K^- p \to π^0 Λ(1405)$ are studied within the effective Lagrangian approach. In addition to the ``background" contribution from the $u$-channel nucleon pole term, contribution from the $Σ(1660)$ resonance with spin-parity $J^P=1/2^+$ is also considered. For the $K^-p \to π^0 π^0 Σ^0$ reaction, we perform a calculation for the total and differential cross sections by considering the contribution from the $Σ(1660)$ intermediate resonance decaying into $π^0 Λ(1405)$ with $Λ(1405)$ decaying into $π^0 Σ^0$. With our model parameters, the available experimental data on both the $K^-p \to π^0 π^0 Σ^0$ and $K^- p \to π^0 Λ(1405)$ reactions can be fairly well reproduced. It is shown that we really need the contribution from the $Σ(1660)$ resonance, and that these experimental measurements could be used to determine some properties of the $Σ(1660)$ resonance.

### [40] [Why is the $Z_c(3900)$ absent in the $h_cπ$ final state?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03697)
*Quanxing Ye,Ying Zhang,Peng-Yu Niu,Qian Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes exotic hadronic states using HQSS, showing significant HQSS violation in charm sector explains selectivity in decay channels, while bottom sector remains symmetric. Molecular nature and threshold effects are confirmed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the differences between charm and bottom sectors in exotic states and clarify the role of HQSS violation in their properties and observed decay patterns.

Method: Constructed S-wave contact interactions across elastic and inelastic channels, solved Lippmann-Schwinger equation, performed global fits to experimental data, and conducted pole analysis.

Result: HQSS violation is major in charm (elastic interactions) causing selective decay appearances, negligible in bottom (uniform peak structures). Z_c(4020) linked to threshold cusp effect. Model robust under form factor/cutoff changes.

Conclusion: HQSS violation explains sectoral differences. Molecular interpretation validated. Threshold effects crucial for Z_c(4020). Results strengthen understanding of hadronic states' dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the exotic hadronic states $Z_c(3900)$, $Z_c(4020)$, $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ within the framework of Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS) and its violation. By constructing S-wave contact interactions between elastic ($D\bar{D}^*/D^*\bar{D}^*$ or $B\bar{B}^*/B^*\bar{B}^*$) and inelastic ($J/ψπ, h_cπ$ or $Υπ$, $h_bπ$) channels, we solve the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to obtain physical production amplitudes and perform a global fit to experimental invariant-mass spectra. Our results demonstrate a striking difference between the charm and bottom sectors: HQSS violation is negligible in the bottom system, leading to comparable peak structures for both $Z_b$ states in all hidden-bottom decay channels. In contrast, significant HQSS breaking is required to describe the $Z_c$ system, where the violation is predominantly concentrated in the elastic interactions. This explains the observed selectivity: $Z_c(3900)$ appears prominently only in $J/ψπ$, while $Z_c(4020)$ appears only in $h_cπ$. Pole analysis confirms the molecular nature of the states, with the $Z_c(4020)$ likely arising from a threshold cusp effect. The model's robustness is verified against variations of the form factor and cutoff, showing stable results.

### [41] [Addicted to Flavour: 1976-2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03722)
*Andrzej J. Buras*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper outlines the author's 50-year journey in Flavour Physics, linking van Leeuwenhoek's 350th anniversary to the search for sub-sub-LHC-scale 'animalcula' (particle physics phenomena) via precise measurements, advanced QCD calculations, and strategic observable choices beyond standard global fits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To commemorate two anniversaries and explore how Flavour Physics can detect new particles at scales beyond current accelerators by combining meticulous experimental data with refined theoretical models.

Method: The author uses NLO/NNLO QCD calculations of Wilson coefficients, addresses non-perturbative QCD effects, selects optimal observables, and advocates for observable correlations over global fits to identify New Physics.

Result: Emphasis on effective field theories (WET/SMEFT), Wilson coefficients' role, and visual aids showing observable correlations as direct SM/NP tests. Also shares personal experiences and anecdotes.

Conclusion: Highlights the necessity of both precise calculations and creative strategy in Flavour Physics to uncover elusive particles, urging researchers to prioritize observable-based tests alongside traditional methods.

Abstract: I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics.

### [42] [Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03341)
*Diego Blas,Yifan Chen,Yuxin Liu,Yanfei Shang,Jing Shu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that microwave cavities with magnetic fields can detect high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs), using a 9-cell cavity to show how multiple electromagnetic modes enable localization and reconstruction of HFGW properties like polarization and frequency drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a novel method for detecting HFGWs by exploiting the unique antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes in cavities, offering an alternative to existing detectors and improving sensitivity through mode multiplicity.

Method: Analysis of a 9-cell cavity's time-domain response to frequency-drifting HFGW signals, examining 18 nearly degenerate modes and their sequential excitation to extract signal properties.

Result: Demonstrated ability to reconstruct polarization ratio and frequency drift rate of HFGWs using multi-mode cavity responses, achieving sensitivity comparable to networks of independent detectors.

Conclusion: Microwave cavities with magnetic fields provide a promising and scalable approach for HFGW detection, capable of characterizing astrophysical sources effectively.

Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.

### [43] [Topological quantization of vector meson anomalous couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03740)
*Chao-Qiang Geng,Chia-Wei Liu,Yue-Liang Wu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper discovers a new anomalous term within hidden local symmetry that enforces topological quantization of vector-meson anomalous couplings, removing unquantized coefficients from existing models. It proposes this term saturates anomalies, explaining vector-meson dominance success and predicting testable form factors via BESIII/Super $τ$-Charm experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unresolved issues in existing hidden local symmetry models which allow arbitrary coefficients in anomalous couplings and do not fully explain vector-meson dominance. The authors aim to establish a quantized framework with topological foundations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of hidden local symmetry Lagrangians to identify a new anomalous term that enforces topological quantization. Predictive calculations of $η^{(-prime)}\to π^+π^-γ^*$ form factors for experimental verification.

Result: Derivation of a term that rigidly quantizes vector-meson couplings topologically. Demonstrates agreement with experimental data (vector-meson dominance success) while identifying limitations. Specifies experimental observables to test the conjecture.

Conclusion: The quantized anomalous term provides a superior theoretical framework for vector-meson couplings. Upcoming form factor measurements can validate or challenge the proposed saturation of anomalies, marking a crucial step for beyond-standard-model physics.

Abstract: We uncover a new anomalous term in hidden local symmetry that enforces the topological quantization of vector-meson anomalous couplings. Unlike existing formulations in the literature, which introduce several unquantized coefficients, our term removes this freedom by fixing the couplings to quantized, topologically determined values. We further conjecture that it saturates the anomaly, explaining the success of vector-meson dominance while pinpointing where saturation must fail. High-precision measurements of $η^{(\prime)}\toπ^+π^-γ^*$ form factors at BESIII and the Super $τ$-Charm Facility can provide a definitive experimental discriminator of this quantized picture.

*E. Estrada,E. Passemar,S. Paz,A. Rodríguez-Sánchez,P. Roig*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes using symmetry-based angular observables in semileptonic τ decays to test Standard Model predictions and detect potential new physics or long-distance electromagnetic corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the nonperturbative nature of quark current hadronization in semileptonic τ decays and provide form-factor independent observables for experimental testing.

Method: Constructing angular observables based solely on symmetry arguments, avoiding reliance on form factors, and estimating new physics impacts using an EFT framework.

Result: Proposed observables remain form-factor independent within the Standard Model (neglecting long-distance EM corrections) and deviations could indicate new physics or electromagnetic effects.

Conclusion: These observables offer a clean experimental probe to either validate the Standard Model or uncover deviations pointing to beyond-Standard Model physics or electromagnetic corrections.

Abstract: Semileptonic $τ$ decays mainly proceed via interactions between charged lepton and quark currents. The hadronization of the quark current is intrinsically nonperturbative and generally cannot be addressed analytically. In these proceedings, we propose using symmetry arguments alone to construct clean angular observables, which, within the Standard Model and in the absence of long-distance electromagnetic corrections, remain form-factor independent. These predictions can be experimentally tested, and any observed deviation could signal either effects of physics beyond the Standard Model or provide a clean benchmark for long-distance electromagnetic corrections. We also perform a first estimate of the expected impact of new physics in an EFT framework.

### [45] [Axion Masses as an Inevitable Consequence of Supersymmetry Breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04017)
*Gayatri Ghosh*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a supersymmetric framework where soft supersymmetry-breaking terms drive Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking and axion mass generation, leading to a correlated spectrum of axion-like particles. It addresses vacuum alignment and CP-violation issues, showing that explicit soft PQ-breaking terms do not cause observable CP-violating effects. Phenomenological implications, including constraints and viable parameter spaces, are analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a supersymmetric origin of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism where axion physics arises naturally from supersymmetry-breaking effects, avoiding reliance on QCD instantons for PQ breaking. This addresses theoretical challenges in axion model-building, such as vacuum alignment and ensuring a naturally small strong CP phase.

Method: The framework assumes an exact PQ symmetry at the supersymmetric limit. Soft supersymmetry-breaking terms (proportional to the gravitino mass) break PQ symmetry explicitly, stabilizing the saxion and providing axion mass. The interplay between QCD-induced and soft-induced axion masses is analyzed to suppress CP violation. Phenomenological constraints are derived through particle lifetimes, couplings, and comparison with observational bounds.

Result: All axion-like particle masses (axion, saxion, axino) depend on the SUSY-breaking scale, creating a tightly correlated spectrum. Explicit soft PQ-breaking terms do not spoil vacuum alignment; strong CP phase is parametrically suppressed. A significant parameter space survives lab, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints, making the model testable.

Conclusion: This framework offers a predictive and consistent axion-like particle model where SUSY-breaking主导产生axion mass. It expands the theoretical landscape of axion phenomenology while remaining compatible with existing observations, highlighting future experimental testing opportunities.

Abstract: We investigate a supersymmetric framework in which soft supersymmetry-breaking effects provide the dominant origin of Peccei--Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking and axion mass generation. In the supersymmetric limit the theory possesses an exact PQ symmetry and a massless axion, while the inclusion of soft terms proportional to the gravitino mass induces spontaneous PQ breaking, stabilizes the saxion direction, and generates a mass for the axion. As a consequence, the axion, saxion, and axino masses are all controlled by the supersymmetry-breaking scale, leading to a correlated and predictive spectrum of axion-like states.
  The presence of explicit soft PQ-breaking terms raises the question of vacuum alignment and CP violation. We show that although the axion mass does not originate from QCD instantons, the induced strong CP phase is parametrically suppressed by the hierarchy between the QCD-induced and soft-induced axion masses. As a result, the explicit breaking does not generate an observable CP-violating vacuum angle across the parameter space of interest.
  We analyze the phenomenological implications of this scenario, including axion lifetimes, axion--photon couplings, and laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints. Direct confrontations with beam-dump and collider searches, together with Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds, demonstrate that a substantial region of parameter space remains viable and testable. The framework thus provides a self-consistent and phenomenologically rich realization of axion-like particles whose masses arise predominantly from soft supersymmetry breaking.

### [46] [Complete NLO BFKL impact factors for quarkonium hadroproduction in NRQCD: the case of ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04142)
*Michael Fucilla,Jean-Philippe Lansberg,Maxim Nefedov,Lech Szymanowski,Samuel Wallon*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a complete next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation of impact factors for hadroproduction of S-wave quarkonium states using the BFKL formalism, including real-emission contributions and one-loop virtual corrections. It demonstrates cancellation of soft divergences and confirms collinear singularities align with factorisation at one loop, enabling future NLL precision studies for quarkonium production in hadron colliders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve the first complete NLO calculation in the BFKL framework, validate the consistency of divergences, and enable next-to-leading-logarithmic precision studies for quarkonium production in high-energy collisions.

Method: Computed real-emission contributions alongside existing one-loop virtual corrections for specific NRQCD states (${^1S_0^{[1]}}$, ${^1S_0^{[8]}}$, ${^3S_1^{[8]}}$), ensured soft divergence cancellation between real and virtual parts, and verified collinear singularities align with factorisation up to one loop.

Result: Cancellations of soft divergences confirmed, collinear singularities consistent with factorisation, establishing the first complete NLO quarkonium impact factor in BFKL framework.

Conclusion: The results pave the way for NLL precision analyses of forward-backward quarkonium associated production at hadron colliders, advancing the application of BFKL resummation in quarkonium physics.

Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading order calculation of the impact factors for hadroproduction of $S$-wave quarkonium states within the BFKL formalism. We present the computation of the real-emission contributions which completes the recent one of one-loop virtual corrections by one of us for the impact factors for the ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ NRQCD states. We prove the cancellation of soft divergences between real and virtual contributions, and that the surviving collinear singularities are compatible with factorisation up to one loop for a novel class of processes where BFKL resummation can be applied. Our work indeed represents the first complete NLO quarkonium impact factor in the BFKL framework and paves the way to first next-to-leading-logarithmic-precision studies for hadroproduction of forward-backward quarkonium associated production at hadron colliders.
