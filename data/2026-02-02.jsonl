Klein"], "title": "Azimuthal angular entanglement between decaying particles in ultra-peripheral ion collisions", "comment": "Submitted for publication. Comments welcome", "summary": "Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) involving relativistic heavy ions are a unique laboratory to study quantum correlations. The intense electromagnetic fields generate high rates of photonuclear interactions, including events involving multiple photon exchange. Multiple photon exchange can result in the production of multiple vector mesons and/or nuclear excitations. These interactions share a common impact parameter, so the photons have the same linear polarization. The shared polarization entangles the particles, leading to unique quantum correlations. The decays of these vector excitations are sensitive to this polarization, allowing for the study of these correlations.\n  This letter will compare classical and quantum calculations of the correlations between these azimuthal directions. The two approaches predict vert different angular correlations. The differences are akin to those seen with polarized photons in tests of Bells inequality. Uniquely, UPC photoproduction can produce final states containing three or more particles, all entangled with the same polarization. These more complex states exhibit additional unique phenomenology, allowing new tests of multi-particle entanglement."}

For a minimal complex PQ scalar with a $U(1)$-symmetric potential and nonlinear sigma-model kinetic term $dσ^{2}=dR^{2}+f^{2}(R)\\,dθ^{2}$, a curved target-space metric endows the axion fluctuation with a time-dependent geometric mass during inflation, suppressing isocurvature without explicit PQ breaking and without extreme radial displacements.

Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought."}

It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a ``direct PBH scenario\". Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\\rm PBH} \\ll M_{\\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \\simeq M_{\\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an ``indirect PBH scenario\" may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events."}

We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $Λ$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors."}

Key results/observations summarized in Table 1, which refers readers to the relevant sections for different comparisons. Submitted to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $γ$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\\rm radio}-L_{\\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\\rm cav}-L_{\\rm X,cool}-L_{\\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$."}

We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients.

However, the contribution from tree-level mechanisms alone to the branching ratio of $Ω^- \\to Ξ^- π^0$ is small due to its color-suppressed nature.

While matter accretion onto supermassive black holes is long thought to accelerate particles to high energies, it has recently been suggested that tidal disruption events, and accretion flares in general, with prominent IR echoes can account for a fraction of the diffuse high-energy neutrino signal. Motivated by this result, we compile a sample of nearby accretion flares detected in the NEOWISE survey featuring strong IR echoes, and we cross-match it with the latest catalog of neutrino alerts, IceCat-1. We recover only a single spatial coincidence between the two catalogs, consistent with a chance coincidence. We find no temporal and spatial coincidences between the two samples, which, given the properties of our sample, appears to challenge previous conclusions. We discuss the physical implications of our results and potential future explorations."}

Notably, early results showed significant complexity to the Fe-K$α$ line profile in AGN, with clear contributions from at least three emitting structures: an inner disc, intermediary broad line region (BLR) scale material, and an outer torus. This poses a new challenge for the modelling of the emission lines, as while fast sophisticated models exist for disc line-profiles, large scale-height material is typically much more complex. In this paper we aim to address this gap, by building a fully analytic model for the emission line profiles from a wind, aimed towards BLR scale material, motivated on previous reverberation studies suggesting a wind on the inner edge of the BLR. Our approach gives a physically motivated, yet computationally fast, model for the intermediary component to the Fe-K$α$ complex seen in the XRISM data. We demonstrate our model on the XRISM observations of NGC 4151 from the performance verification phase, showing that it gives a good description of the data, with physically reasonable parameters for BLR scale material. We also show that our model naturally gives the smooth line profile seen in the data, due to the large spatial extent of a wind. Finally, we make our model code public to the community, and name it xwind."}

Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state."}

Exotic colored fermions and scalars mediate radiative neutrino mass generation at the one loop-level. The PQ charge assignment forbids tree-level neutrino masses and leaves a residual $Z_3$ symmetry that ensures the Dirac nature of neutrinos. In the minimal realization, the neutrino mass matrix is of rank two, predicting one massless neutrino. Consequently, the sum of neutrino masses is constrained for both the normal and inverted hierarchies. We analyze the implications for charged lepton flavor violation and the lepton $g-2$. The axion emerging from this framework dynamically resolves the strong CP problem and accounts for the observed dark matter abundance.

In this work, we revisit the thermodynamic stability of ultraspinning black holes by performing a systematic analysis of the heat capacity in different ensembles over the full range of the horizon radius $r_H$, which were missed in earlier temperature-based analyses. We demonstrate for the first time that, contrary to earlier claims, ultraspinning black holes can admit thermodynamically stable regions, whose existence crucially depends on the spacetime dimension, the solution branch, and the presence of charge. In addition, we present the first application of the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality to ultraspinning black holes. Despite the violation of the original reverse isoperimetric inequality in this super-entropic regime, we find that the revised inequality remains applicable and imposes nontrivial constraints on the allowed parameter space, including an upper bound on the ultraspinning parameter $μ$, strengthened lower bounds on the mass $m$, and upper bounds on both the charge $q$ and the AdS radius $l$. To ensure the consistency of the thermodynamic description, the conserved charges and the first law in the ultraspinning limit are derived using the Iyer-Wald formalism together with integrability conditions."}

We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei."}

However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments."}

As they propagate through the anisotropic quark-gluon plasma, medium-induced interactions lead to path-length dependent depolarization, imprinting an azimuthally anisotropic polarization pattern. Within the framework of rotational Brownian motion, we show that the resulting polarization harmonics are directly related to the initial spatial eccentricities, thereby establishing heavy-flavor polarization anisotropies as a sensitive and complementary probe of the early-time collision geometry.

Mesons and baryons are modeled as open relativistic strings with quark-antiquark and quark-diquark endpoints, respectively, leading to an exponential Hagedorn growth of states with a limiting temperature fixed by the string tension. We find that continuous Hagedorn spectra constrained by experimentally established hadrons underestimate net-baryon number fluctuations obtained in lattice QCD calculations. By extracting the Hagedorn string spectrum directly from lattice QCD through a fit to the second-order net-baryon number susceptibility, we obtain a consistent description of a broad set of fluctuations of conserved charges from LQCD with the Hagedorn temperature $T_H \\simeq 323~$MeV, without introducing additional free parameters. Our results provide thermodynamic evidence in support of a string quark-diquark picture of baryons in the confined phase of QCD."}

The black hole is characterized by the ( MOG) parameter (α) and the charge (Q). The study finds that as (α) increases, the event horizon radius (r_h), photon sphere radius (r_{ph}), and critical impact parameter (b_{ph}) all increase, while these decrease as (Q) increases. The innermost stable circular orbit radius (r_{isco}) exhibits similar monotonic behavior. Ray-tracing shows that as (Q) increases, the impact parameter (b) interval between the lensing ring and photon ring widens; (b_{\\text{ph}}) is non-degenerate, and the photon ring radius is uniquely determined by (α) and (Q). Using $EHT$ constraints on (SgrA^*) and (M87^*), the bounds on (α) and (Q) are derived. For (Q = 0), (0.5), and (1), the allowed ranges are (α\\in [0, 0.06]), ([0, 0.11]), and ([0.19, 0.36]), respectively. Radiative simulations show that for fixed (Q), larger (α) leads to a larger, non-degenerate photon ring. The Schwarzschild case is approached only when both (α) and (Q) are small. This provides a computational basis for testing modified black holes and offers a non-degenerate observational criterion for distinguishing quantum gravity models, consistent with current $EHT$ data. Future observations with $ngEHT$ and multi-band polarization can further test this. The results suggest that studying the photon ring structure of a Reissner-Nordström black hole in scalar-tensor-vector gravity provides a unique optical diagnostic for potential quantum-gravity tests and black hole properties."}

To investigate the nature of GRB jets, here we focus on X-ray flares (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs), which are X-ray emissions that occur 100 to 1000 seconds after the main burst. They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $Γ$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years. The detection and non-detection rates for each detector are key to determining the uncertain yet essential values necessary for understanding the physics of GRB jets."}

The subtraction terms are all based on the well-understood process of single-Higgs production. The core of our subtraction scheme relies on achieving local factorization in all infrared limits of real and virtual momenta. This necessitates systematic modifications of the original Feynman integrand for loop amplitudes, enabling gauge symmetry cancellations before performing integrations.

While its universal manifestation is a net change of proper distances, gravitational-wave detectors are intrinsically insensitive to the final offset and can only probe the associated transition. A central challenge for any claim of detection therefore lies in defining a physically meaningful and operationally robust model of this time-dependent signal, which is uniquely attributable to gravitational memory and distinguishable from purely oscillatory radiation. In this work, we propose a general solution to this challenge. Building on a self-contained review of the theory of gravitational memory, we discuss a theoretical framework for defining and modeling a gravitational memory rise, in particular applicable to compact binary coalescences. Specializing to space-based detectors, we analyze the response of LISA to gravitational radiation including a memory contribution, with particular emphasis on mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which offer the most promising prospects for a first single-event detection. The framework developed here provides the theoretical foundation for statistically well-defined hypothesis testing between memory-free and memory-full radiation and quantitative assessments of detection prospects. As such, these results establish a principled pathway toward a future observational claim of gravitational memory."}

In this work, we explore the ability of LISA to observe and characterize this effect. In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories.

We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $60^\\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($β= 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\\circ$ case at $β= 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows.

In this study, we present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger analysis to investigate the physical origin of this emission. Swift-XRT monitoring reveals a quasi-quiescent state characterized by a low X-ray flux. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with the leptohadronic code AMES, we find that a standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model underpredicts the VHE flux by $\\sim$70% due to the insufficient target photon density provided by the weak X-ray emission, unless a high Doppler factor ($δ\\gtrsim 5$) is invoked. Alternatively, an external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario-scattering seed photons from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)-successfully reproduces the broadband spectral energy distribution with a modest jet power and Doppler factor.

Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J.

Springer, Singapore", "summary": "The IceCube neutrino observatory consists of an array of Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) instrumenting one cubic-kilometer of deep glacial ice at the South Pole. DeepCore, a densely-spaced sub-array of DOMs at the bottom central region of IceCube, enables the detection of atmospheric neutrinos with an energy threshold in the GeV range. The high statistics data of DeepCore provides a unique opportunity to perform neutrino oscillation studies as well as explore various sub-leading Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics signatures. We consider a well-motivated minimal extension of the Standard Model by an additional anomaly-free, gauged lepton-number symmetry, such as $L_e - L_μ$ or $L_e - L_τ$. These symmetries give rise to flavor-dependent long-range interaction mediated through a very light neutral gauge boson. In this contribution, we present the sensitivity of the IceCube DeepCore detector to search for this flavor-dependent long-range interaction potential with a runtime of 9.3 years."}

Suvorov", "Kostas Glampedakis"], "title": "On the dynamics of magnetoviscous warped discs around compact objects", "comment": "19 pages, 10 figures, 1 table. Comments welcome !", "summary": "Accretion discs that are tilted with respect to their compact hosts can warp out-of-plane through general relativistic frame-dragging. Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei."}

Kimura"], "title": "High energy neutrinos from pulsar-powered optical transients: LFBOTs as potential origin of the KM3NeT event KM3-230213A", "comment": "14 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration reported the detection of an ultra-high energy ($\\sim 220$ PeV) neutrino event, KM3-230213A. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into whether this event could originate from the diffuse neutrino flux produced by a class of pulsar-powered optical transients. In particular, we consider populations of ordinary supernovae (SNe), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) with a newly formed magnetar as the central engine. We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies. Combining our results, we conclude that a diffuse neutrino flux from a population of LFBOTs can explain the KM3NeT event. Therefore, pulsar-powered optical transients may serve as promising sources for the current and upcoming high-energy and ultra-high energy neutrino telescopes."}
