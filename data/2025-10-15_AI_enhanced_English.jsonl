In a\ntypical construction, elastic scattering is absent at tree level, and a lighter\ndark matter state must first upscatter into a heavier state in order to\ninteract with the nuclei in the detector. We model the excitation of IDM in the\nEarth followed by its downscattering inside a detector, and we show that\nconsidering this process markedly enhances the sensitivity of existing\ndetectors. In particular, current limits based on XENON100 and XENON1T data can\nbe extended to significantly larger mass splittings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Inelastic dark matter (IDM) models, which require upscattering before interaction, enhance detector sensitivity by considering excitation in Earth and downscattering in detectors, extending XENON100/XENON1T limits to larger mass splittings.", "motivation": "To address IDM's consistency with direct detection experiments' limits by exploring processes that improve sensitivity despite energy thresholds.", "method": "Model excitation of IDM in Earth followed by downscattering in detectors, analyzing XENON100 and XENON1T data to assess extended mass splitting constraints.", "result": "Existing detector sensitivities are significantly improved; XENON data now constrain larger mass splittings than previously thought.", "conclusion": "IDM models' viability is bolstered by Earth-mediated upscattering, showing existing detectors can probe broader parameter spaces without experimental upgrades."}}
