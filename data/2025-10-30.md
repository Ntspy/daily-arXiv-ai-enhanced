### [1] [Emission and Absorption Features of Magnetically Driven Disk Winds in Black Hole X-Ray Binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24844)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines accretion disk winds in galactic black hole X-ray binaries using 3D radiative transfer simulations, showing that high-polar-angle winds produce observable absorption features and scattering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of blueshifted absorption features in X-ray spectra of BH XRBs and the ionization structure driving these winds.

Method: Modeling winds as MHD-driven outflows with MONACO's Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to compute synthetic spectra for high/soft state BH XRBs.

Result: Synthetic spectra reveal asymmetric multi-ion absorption lines and P-Cygni-like emission in high-polar-angle views, indicating dense winds avoid saturation due to scattering.

Conclusion: The findings support global magnetic fields as wind drivers and explain observed spectral features through scattering effects in dense, high-angle winds.

Abstract: We investigate accretion disk winds commonly observed in galactic black hole
(BH) X-ray binaries (XRB), which manifest as blueshifted absorption features in
X-ray spectra. We model these winds as ideal magnetohydrodynamic outflows of
hot plasma driven by global magnetic fields threading the accretion disk around
the BH. Using Monte Carlo simulations with MONACO, we solve three-dimensional
radiative transfer equations to determine the large-scale ionization structure
that produces the observed ionic column densities. Focusing on the high/soft
state of the BH XRB, where disk emission provides the dominant source of
ionizing X-rays, we calculated synthetic spectra showing resonance absorption
and scattered emission from ions in various charge states. Our results
demonstrate that systems viewed at high polar angles exhibit prominent
multi-ion absorption lines with asymmetric profiles, accompanied by
P-Cygni-like emission features that partially reproduce the characteristics
seen in the observed spectra. This further implies that even a dense disk wind
with a high polar angle is unlikely to be saturated due to effective
scattering.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents results from two years of NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the JWST NEP TDF, detecting numerous sources and consistent logN-logS trends with previous surveys, while finding a significant fraction of obscured AGN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the multi-wavelength study of the NEP TDF, continuing long-term monitoring to understand X-ray source populations, cosmic X-ray background contributions, and obscured AGN demographics.

Method: Analyzed 2 Ms NuSTAR (8-24 keV) and 166 ks XMM-Newton (0.3-10 keV) data from cycles 8-9. Performed source detection, flux measurements, logN-logS analysis, and compared obscured AGN fractions with prior surveys.

Result: Detected 75 NuSTAR and 274 XMM sources at 99% reliability. LogN-logS slope (α=1.13±0.46) is flatter than previous but consistent with Euclidean. 36% of NuSTAR sources are heavily obscured (N_H≥1e23 cm^-2), with 9+18-8% Compton-thick AGN, matching prior results.

Conclusion: Confirmed stable X-ray source populations over time, validated prior obscured AGN fraction estimates, and reinforced the NEP field's value for studying obscured AGN and cosmic X-ray background contributions.

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain
Field (TDF) has been monitored by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton with a regular cadence
for five years starting in 2019. The survey has accumulated 3.5Ms of NuSTAR
exposure and 228 ks quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observations covering 0.31
deg^2. This paper presents the results from the most recent two-years' 2Ms
NuSTAR and 166 ks XMM observations in NuSTAR cycles 8 and 9. These observations
reached a 20%-area flux of 2.20 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 8-24 keV band.
75 NuSTAR sources and 274 XMM-Newton sources are detected at 99% reliability
level. The logN-logS measured in cycles 8+9 are consistent with those measured
in the previous cycle 5+6 NuSTAR NEP survey, but in a larger area (0.3 deg^2
compared with 0.19 deg^2). The slope of the cycles 8+9 8-24 keV logN-logS curve
is flatter than other works ({\alpha}89 = 1.13 +/- 0.46), but is consistent
with the Euclidean value of {\alpha} = 1.50. In addition, we found ~36% of the
NuSTAR sources to be heavily obscured (NH >= 10^23 cm^-2). The Compton-thick
(NH >= 10^24 cm^-2) (CT-) AGN fraction is 9+18-8% in the NEP-TDF, which is
consistent with the measurements in previous surveys.

### [3] [Fast-Cooling Synchrotron Prompt Emission from Internal Shocks in GRB 241030A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24864)
*Varun,Bin-Bin Zhang,Xiao-Hong Zhao,Jun Yang,Run-Chao Chen,Vikas Chand*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study confirms the synchrotron origin of GRB 241030A's prompt emission through Swift-Fermi data analysis, supporting internal shocks with steady magnetic field and variable electron Lorentz factors. Key evidence includes spectral breaks at ~2-3 keV, stable slopes, and minimal lag.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve debates on GRB emission mechanisms (internal shocks vs. magnetar-like models) by isolating synchrotron signatures and testing predictions of matter-dominated internal shock scenarios against magnetized outflow models.

Method: Time-resolved spectral analysis of Swift/Fermi data across two emission episodes (0-45 s and 100-200 s), identifying spectral breaks, photon index clusters (-2/3, -3/2), and flux/fluence correlations while comparing model predictions for magnetized vs. internal shock scenarios.

Result: Observations align with internal shocks: stable low-energy break (E_b ~2-3 keV), Ep tracking flux but stepping down between pulses, canonical slopes, zero lag. Contradicts magnetized models with their predicted hard-to-soft Ep evolution, increasing ν_c, and significant lags.

Conclusion: GRB prompt emission from 241030A favors a matter-dominated internal shock origin with steady B-field and variable electron energy distribution parameters, providing the first clean synchrotron signature in a long quiescent interval.

Abstract: We present a time-resolved, joint Swift-Fermi spectral study of GRB 241030A
(z=1.411) that cleanly isolates the synchrotron origin of its prompt emission
and favors a matter-dominated, internal-shock scenario. The light curve shows
two episodes separated by a quiescent gap. Episode I (0-45 s) is well described
by a single power law with photon index $\simeq -3/2$, consistent with the
fast-cooling synchrotron slope below the peak. Episode II (100-200 s), exhibits
two robust spectral breaks: a low-energy break at $E_{b}$$\sim$$2-3$ keV that
remains nearly constant in time, and a spectral peak $E_{p}$ that tracks the
flux within pulses but steps down between them. The photon indices below and
above $E_{b}$ cluster around -2/3 and -3/2, respectively, as expected for
fast-cooling synchrotron emission. The burst displays an unusually small
(consistent with zero) spectral lag across GBM bands. At later times ($\geq
230$ s), the spectrum softens toward $\sim-2.7$, as expected when the observing
band lies above both $\nu_m$ and $\nu_c$. These behaviors are difficult to
reconcile with a globally magnetized outflow with a decaying field, which
naturally produces hard-to-soft Ep evolution, growing $\nu_c$, and appreciable
lags. By contrast, internal shocks with a roughly steady effective magnetic
field and a time-variable minimum electron Lorentz factor (equivalently, e.g.,
a varying fraction of accelerated electrons simultaneously account for (i) the
stable $E_{b}$, (ii) the intensity-tracking yet step-down $E_{p}$, (iii) the
canonical -2/3 and -3/2 slopes, and (iv) the near-zero lag.

TL;DR: The analysis measures the flavor composition of cosmic neutrinos using 11.4 years of IceCube data, finding a flavor ratio consistent with neutrino oscillations and ruling out neutron decay as the production mechanism at 99% confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the all-sky neutrino flux's flavor composition at TeV-PeV energies, extending measurements down to the TeV scale and testing neutrino oscillation theories.

Method: Classified IceCube events into three flavor-dependent morphologies, applied a broken power law model for cosmic neutrinos, and used statistical methods to determine flavor ratios and constraints.

Result: The best fit flavor ratio is 0.30:0.37:0.33 (e:μ:τ), consistent with three-flavor oscillations. All flavors are detected above 90% CL, and neutron decay as a production mechanism is excluded at 99% CL.

Conclusion: Cosmic neutrinos exhibit flavor ratios matching oscillation predictions, and their sources do not primarily produce via neutron decay. This confirms oscillation models and constrains astrophysical production mechanisms.

Abstract: Neutrinos oscillate over cosmic distances. Using 11.4 years of IceCube data,
the flavor composition of the all-sky neutrino flux from 5\,TeV--10\,PeV is
studied. We report the first measurement down to the $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) scale
using events classified into three flavor-dependent morphologies. The best fit
flavor ratio is $f_e:f_{\mu}:f_{\tau}\,=\,0.30:0.37:0.33$, consistent with the
standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation model. Each fraction is constrained
to be $>0$ at $>$ 90\% confidence level, assuming a broken power law for cosmic
neutrinos. We infer the flavor composition of cosmic neutrinos at their
sources, and find production via neutron decay lies outside the 99\% confidence
interval.

### [5] [An Extreme Scattering Event Toward PSR J2313+4253](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24962)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper reports an extreme scattering event (ESE) observed in PSR J2313+4253 using high-cadence observations from the Green Bank Observatory. Key features include caustic spikes, a drop in scintillation bandwidth, and a detached feature in the secondary spectrum, indicating altered scattering region properties compared to previous epochs. The modeled scattering region has a distance of 1.04 kpc, size of 15 AU, and lasted ~220 days.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study small-scale structures in the interstellar medium (ISM) by analyzing rare ESEs, which provide insights into plasma lensing and scattering phenomena.

Method: High-cadence observations with the Green Bank Observatory 20m telescope, analysis of secondary spectra, and modeling using a Gaussian plasma lens model compared to a noise model.

Result: Detection of an ESE with unique features like paired caustic spikes and a detached lensing signature, indicating scattering regions at different distances than previous events. The Gaussian model was 197x more likely than noise, confirming the ESE's validity.

Conclusion: ESEs offer critical data for understanding ISM structures. The observed event's parameters refine models of plasma distributions and dynamics, highlighting the value of continued high-cadence monitoring for similar phenomena.

Abstract: We present evidence of an extreme scattering event (ESE) toward PSR
J2313+4253 using high-cadence observations taken with the Green Bank
Observatory 20m telescope. The high density of observations in time allow for
detailed tracking of the event. We observe a pair of caustic spikes along with
the characteristic drop in scintillation bandwidth that is expected during an
ESE. This pattern implies that the structures predominantly responsible for
scattering occur at different distances than those from previous and subsequent
epochs. A secondary spectrum processed during the event shows a detached
feature similar to those found in double lensing events from previously
observed ESEs. We measure this event as originating from a scattering region
with a distance of 1.04(1) kpc, a transverse size of 15 AU, and a duration of
approximately 220 days. We model the event using a Gaussian plasma lens, which,
when compared to a pure-noise model, is 197 times more probable. These rare
events provide opportunities to study the properties of small-scale structures
in the ISM.

TL;DR: The first high-resolution X-ray spectrum of NGC 7213 using XRISM/Resolve and multi-wavelength data reveals a radially stratified structure in the AGN, showing emission from the inner disk, broad-line region, and a weak torus. This positions the source in an intermediate accretion state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the structure and accretion state of NGC 7213 by analyzing high-resolution X-ray spectra alongside multi-wavelength observations, addressing gaps in understanding the connection between narrow and broad emission components and the role of the torus.

Method: Obtained XRISM/Resolve X-ray spectrum combined with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR (X-ray), and SOAR optical data. Analyzed Fe Kα line components, Fe XXV/XXVI lines, and compared with Hα optical data to infer emission regions and accretion state.

Result: Detected two Fe Kα components: a narrow core at ~dust sublimation radius and a broader disk component at ~100 Rg matching double-peaked Hα. Broadened Fe XXV/Fe XXVI link inner disk and BLR. Weak Fe Kα EW and no Compton hump suggest a low-covering-fraction, Compton-thin torus.

Conclusion: NGC 7213 exhibits a radially stratified structure spanning ~4 orders of magnitude in radius, indicating an intermediate accretion state where the torus is dissipating while the inner disk and BLR persist.

Abstract: We present the first high-resolution X-ray spectrum of NGC 7213 obtained with
XRISM/Resolve, supported by simultaneous XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and SOAR optical
data. The XRISM spectrum resolves the neutral Fe\,K$\alpha$ into two
components: a narrow core ($\rm FWHM = 650_{-220}^{+240}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$)
consistent with emission at the dust sublimation radius, and a broader,
asymmetric line best described by disk-like emission from $\sim 100\,\rm
R_{g}$. This disk component mirrors the profile of the double-peaked H$\alpha$
line observed in the optical. In addition, we detect broadened Fe XXV and Fe
XXVI emission lines whose inferred locations bridge the gap between the inner
disk and the optical broad-line region. The weak narrow Fe K$\alpha$ equivalent
width ($\rm EW = 32 \pm 6\,eV$) and absence of a Compton hump imply a
low-covering-fraction, Compton-thin torus. Together, these results reveal a
radially stratified structure in NGC 7213, spanning nearly four orders of
magnitude in radius, and place the source in an intermediate accretion state
($\rm \lambda_{Edd} = 0.001-0.01$) where the inner disk and BLR remain, while
the torus shows signs of dissipation.

### [7] [Pulse profile variations in the accreting X-ray pulsar Vela X-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24973)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Vela X-1's X-ray pulse profiles show stability over decades but exhibit short-term variations. Key findings include epoch changes due to absorption, flux-dependent variability, and sporadic deviations in individual pulse cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the pulse profile's stability over decades and its variations on short timescales, investigating factors like absorption and flux dependencies.

Method: Analyzing XMM-Newton observations from 2000, 2006, 2019 using energy-resolved pulse profiles, subsets of pulse cycles (time/flux/similarity), and comparing individual cycles to average profiles.

Result: Stable average profiles over decades with epoch variations linked to absorption. Residual differences are flux-dependent. Most individual pulses resemble the average but with sporadic deviations.

Conclusion: Vela X-1's pulse morphology is fundamentally stable, with variations driven by absorption changes and flux levels, suggesting underlying emission processes modulated by accretion or magnetic field interactions.

Abstract: Vela X-1 is a well-studied accreting X-ray pulsar, with a distinctive pulse
profile that has been found to be very similar in different observations spread
out over decades. On the other hand, significant variations down to the
timescale of individual pulses have been observed. The physical mechanisms
leading to the energy-resolved pulse profile and its variations are not fully
understood. Long, uninterrupted observations of Vela X-1 with XMM-Newton in
2000, 2006 and 2019 at different orbital phases allow us to study variations of
the pulse properties in the soft X-ray range on all timescales in detail. We
aim to characterize and quantify the variations of pulse profiles and
individual pulse cycles on all timescales probed, and to identify possible
factors driving the observed variations on these timescales. We generated
consistent energy-resolved pulse profiles for each observation, as well as
profiles built from subsets of individual pulse cycles selected by time, flux,
or similarity to the mean profiles. We identified five pulsed phases based on
the profile morphology and hardness, and examined the relative contributions
over time. To quantify short-timescale variability, we compared individual
pulse cycles with synthetic light curves derived from scaled versions of the
average profiles. The pulse profile of Vela X-1, when averaged over many pulse
cycles, remains remarkably stable, as expected. The most prominent variations
between epochs are attributable to changes in absorption. Residual systematic
differences are primarily flux-dependent, with profiles showing less
variability at higher flux levels. On shorter timescales, most individual pulse
cycles resemble the average profile, even though significant, sporadic
deviations are also present.

### [8] [Physical properties of long-rising type II Supernovae -- Bayesian Analytic Modelling and Spectrophotometric Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25018)
*S. P. Cosentino,C. Inserra,M. L. Pumo*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes 1987A-like supernovae using a Bayesian method, finding two groups: lower-energy events with low Ni-56 and more energetic ones with higher Ni-56 and extended progenitors. It identifies correlations between Ni-56, luminosity, energy, and an anti-correlation between Ba II strength and velocity, advocating for improved models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1987A-like SNe are rare (1-3%) and show diversity in properties. The study aims to better understand their explosion parameters and systematic trends.

Method: A new Bayesian parameter estimation method using a Ni-56-dependent analytical model applied to light curves and velocities of a large 1987A-like SN sample.

Result: Two explosion groups identified: low-energy (0.07 Msun Ni-56) and high-energy (5 foe, more Ni-56). Correlations found between Ni-56 mass, luminosity, energy, and ejecta mass/recombination time. Anti-correlation between Ba II strength and velocity.

Conclusion: 1987A-like SNe require diverse models; current frameworks need expansion to include more energy sources for accurate modeling of peculiar transients.

Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40~days) light curve,
defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing
only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity
environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and
explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of
1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic
energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni
mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical
properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian
parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model
for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light
curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive
1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent
analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a
heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i)
lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07~M$_\odot$),
similar to SN~1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5~foe) with
larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We
confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and
explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale.
An anti-correlation between Ba~II line strength and photospheric velocity
indicates that stronger Ba~II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more
compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend
analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable
and accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients.

### [9] [Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE: Bow Shock](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25033)
*Guobin Mou,Xinwen Shu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR:  The paper investigates the radio emission differences between bow shock (BS) and forward shock (FS) in TDEs, showing BS emits higher frequency radio waves with steeper flux changes and distinct spectral features, aiding in probing dense gas near galactic nuclei.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of radio afterglows in TDEs, distinguish between BS and FS scenarios by simulating BS's impact on radio emission dynamics.

Method: Two-fluid simulations with relativistic electrons for BS scenario, followed by radiative transfer calculations to model synchrotron spectra, contrasting results with FS (from Paper I).

Result: BS causes higher peak frequency, steeper flux rise/decline, spectral features like double peaks, and sensitivity to outflow fluctuations; combined BS+FS deviate from single-zone models.

Conclusion: BS is crucial for interpreting TDE radio observations, offering a new method to study dense circumnuclear gas via spectral decomposition.

Abstract: The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption
events (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a
forward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a
bow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different.
To elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted
two-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the
spatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on
their spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to
obtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results
for the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to
that from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak
frequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The
radio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The
combined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing
significant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases
producing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights
the importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas
on sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to
reveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas.

*Roger Clay*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the 2025 June 01 Forbush Decrease, the deepest in two decades, caused by a complex series of solar events. The study uses data from a muon telescope to examine flux reduction across a rarely accessible high-energy range (GeV to mid-TeV), tracking both unaccompanied muons and small air showers. The research highlights the event's intensity enabling precise measurements due to its extreme depth and demonstrates the evolving time structure over seven days.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the extreme Forbush Decrease phenomenon, particularly its effects at high energies where measurements are typically challenging due to low cosmic ray flux. The depth of this event allows overcoming statistical limitations in flux reduction measurements.

Method: Analysis of data from a muon telescope capable of detecting unaccompanied muons and small air showers across GeV to mid-TeV energy ranges. The focus is on quantifying the flux reduction fraction and tracking the temporal development over seven days.

Result: The Forbush Decrease caused a statistically significant flux reduction across the studied energy range, with detailed observations of its time-varying structure. The extreme depth enabled precise measurements that are usually limited by particle counting statistics.

Conclusion: The 2025 event provides unique insights into high-energy cosmic ray behavior during solar eruptions, demonstrating the feasibility of studying Forbush Decreases at mid-TeV energies and the importance of considering multi-day temporal evolution in such phenomena.

Abstract: The 2025 June 01 Forbush Decrease in the terrestrial ground-level flux of
cosmic ray secondaries was recorded by many cosmic ray systems. This was the
deepest such decrease, from the quiescent value of the flux, which has been
observed in the past two decades. It resulted from a complex series of solar
events, none of which on its own reached the most extreme level. The extreme
depth of this Decrease has enabled measurements of the flux reduction to be
made, which would normally be severely limited by particle counting statistics.
In particular, here we examine the Decrease phenomenon over a primary cosmic
ray energy range which is rarely accessible, due to the low flux of high energy
cosmic rays. This work considers data mainly from a muon telescope system which
can respond to both unaccompanied muons and small cosmic ray air showers,
providing data from GeV to mid-TeV energies, where the Forbush Decrease ceases
to be statistically observable. This paper examines the depth of the flux
Decrease, as a fraction below its quiescent value, over that primary energy
range. The progressive development of internal time structure in the flux
through the seven days of the phenomenon is also demonstrated.

### [11] [XRISM Spectroscopy of the Stellar-mass Black Hole GRS 1915+105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25089)
*Jon M. Miller,Liyi Gu,John Raymond,Laura Brenneman,Elena Gallo,Poshak Gandhi,Timothy Kallman,Shogo Kobayashi,Junjie Mao,Megumi Shidatsu,Yoshihiro Ueda,Xin Xiang,Abderahmen Zoghbi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The first XRISM observation of GRS 1915+105 reveals a sub-Eddington black hole obscured by warm, Compton-thick gas. Strong emission lines and radiative recombination continuum features suggest photoionized gas in the outer disk atmosphere or a slow wind. The obscuration may result from a warped, precessing disk moving the outer disk into our line of sight, altering its observed characteristics to resemble Type-2 AGN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the recent evolutionary changes in GRS 1915+105, which now exhibits characteristics of Type-2/Compton-thick AGN instead of its previous Type-1 behavior. The study aims to understand the nature of obscuration and emission mechanisms in this transitional source.

Method: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy using XRISM's Resolve calorimeter to analyze emission lines (e.g., Si, S, Ar, Fe) and continuum features, combined with photoionization modeling to interpret the observed spectra in terms of disk/wind geometry and ionization states.

Result: Detection of warm Compton-thick gas obscuration creating a coronagraph effect. Emission lines fit to three photoionized zones with disk/wind origins at ~1e6 GM/c², plus a broad base in Fe lines suggesting emission at ~3e3 GM/c². RRC features confirm photoionization. Obscuration likely from a warped, precessing disk rather than higher accretion rates.

Conclusion: GRS 1915+105's current obscuration state is best explained by disk warping/precession bringing outer disk material into the line of sight, demonstrating accretion disk dynamics' role in obscuration variability. This mechanism bridges stellar-mass black hole behavior with AGN-type obscuration phenomena.

Abstract: GRS 1915$+$105 was the stellar-mass black hole that best reproduced key
phenomena that are also observed in Type-1 active galactic nuclei. In recent
years, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN.
Herein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The
high-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington
central engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the
obscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines
from He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni
dominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are
also observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The
line spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening
and bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or
a slow wind at $r \simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI
Ly-$\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r
\sim 3\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein
the current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated
outer disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction
is higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk
that has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the
strengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible
explanations of some potentially novel spectral features.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accretion near black holes (BHs) is multidimensional, with turbulence,
resistivity, thermal transport, and dust dynamics all playing essential roles.
In cold accretion discs (ADs) or the region of an AD where magnetic fields
(MFs) are negligible (or absent), hydrodynamic (HD) turbulence is probably
dominating. However, Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is the primary cause
of turbulence in ADs. Significant velocity variations and rapid pressure
changes are characteristics of turbulent flows, which allow better mixing and
more angular momentum (AM) and energy transfer. Also, in accretion flow (AF),
the interaction between turbulence and resistivity determines the efficiency of
energy dissipation and heat transfer. Radiation, convection, and thermal
conduction (TC) are the heat transport modes existing in AFs, where TC enables
energy transfer in accreting materials via heat flux. Moreover, convection,
also generated by turbulence, significantly impacts the stability of the AD and
its vertical structure. The disc may be affected by radiation from the AD
surrounding the BH when X-ray emission occurs. The emission from the disc is
also affected by dust particles. Dust grains near BH are exposed to high
temperatures and intense radiation, which might affect the flow
characteristics, as seen in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This chapter
highlights the combined effect of turbulence, resistivity, transport
mechanisms, and dust particles on BH AF. Future studies in this field must
thoroughly investigate how dust, transport mechanisms, and turbulence interact
in the BH accretion system.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd
show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days,
providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a
disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in
the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons
emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in
the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd
during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the
evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy
fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\dot{m}$,
which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\propto \dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much
shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum
in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and
black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be
a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a
stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical
AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column
density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution,
which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the
inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.

Abstract: We present an investigation of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes
coupled with clouds of strings, examining two distinct theoretical models that
incorporate quantum gravitational effects through different implementations of
correction terms. Our study explores the geodesic structure, focusing on photon
sphere properties, black hole shadows, and innermost stable circular orbits of
test particles around these exotic geometries. The analysis reveals fundamental
modifications to particle trajectories that distinguish quantum-corrected
solutions from their classical counterparts, with observable implications for
high-energy astrophysics. We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations arising
from test particle motion, deriving frequency relationships that could serve as
observational probes of quantum gravity effects in accreting black hole
systems. Through rigorous gravitational lensing analysis using the Gauss-Bonnet
theorem, we calculate weak-field deflection angles and identify distinctive
signatures that enable discrimination between the two quantum correction
models. The gravitational lensing study reveals opposite dependencies on
quantum parameters between the models, providing unambiguous observational
discriminants. Additionally, we analyze the thermodynamic properties including
temperature, entropy, and heat capacity modifications, exploring topological
characteristics and phase transition behavior in these quantum-corrected
systems. The investigation reveals that the two models exhibit contrasting
behaviors across multiple observational channels, from gravitational lensing
deflection angles to quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies, providing
remarkable discriminants for testing quantum gravity theories.

*Akira Ito,Ryuichiro Akaho,Hiroki Nagakura,Shoichi Yamada*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-resolution method for neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae simulations, using high resolution for advection and lower resolution for collision terms to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the low angular resolution limitations of the S_N method in multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae, which hinders accurate modeling of neutrino transport.

Method: Implements a dual-resolution approach where advection is computed at high angular resolution and collision terms at lower resolution. Conversion between resolutions uses polynomial interpolation preserving number conservation and continuity (periodicity in azimuthal direction). Test simulations use angle/energy-dependent source terms to mimic advection and include nucleon scattering with full recoil effects.

Result: The dual-resolution scheme works effectively. Current angular resolutions in standard simulations (or slightly better in phi direction) are sufficient for collision terms when coupled with high-resolution advection via this method.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully balances computational efficiency and accuracy, offering a viable solution for improving neutrino transport simulations in core-collapse supernovae without excessive resource demands.

Abstract: We propose a dual-resolution prescription meant for the Boltzmann neutrino
transport, in which the advection and collision terms are calculated with
different angular resolutions in momentum space. The purpose is to address the
issue of the low resolution that afflicts the $S_N$ method in the
multi-dimensional neutrino transport simulations for core-collapse supernovae.
We handle with a high resolution the advection term alone, assuming that the
collision term does not require such high resolutions. To confirm this surmise
as well as our new conversion scheme, from low- to high-angular resolutions and
vice versa, we run a couple of experimental one-zone (in space) simulations.
Neutrino scatterings on nucleons are considered with small recoils fully taken
into account whereas the advection term is replaced by the angle- and
energy-dependent source terms that are designed to mimic the results of a
Boltzmann simulation, inducing the anisotropy in momentum space. For the
conversion from a low-resolution distribution function to a high-resolution
one, we employ a polynomial interpolations in the zenith and azimuth directions
separately with the number conservation and continuity (and periodicity only in
the azimuth direction). We find that this dual-resolution scheme works well and
that the current angular resolution employed in the canonical supernova
simulations with our Boltzmann solver or a bit better in the $\phi_\nu$
direction will be sufficient for the collision terms if they are coupled with
the advection terms calculated with a high-angular resolution via this
prescription.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of gravitational wave signals from 150+ binary black holes in GWTC-4 reveals distinct peaks in mass distributions and correlations, suggesting a possible hierarchical merger scenario. However, most observed features are unconstrained and do not fully align with theoretical expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the population properties of binary black holes using the Vamana mixture-model framework, exploring mass/spin distributions, their correlations, and redshift evolution to shed light on formation channels.

Method: Applied Vamana framework to analyze mass and spin distributions from GWTC-4 data, examining one-dimensional distributions, correlations between primary/secondary masses, and redshift dependence.

Result: Key findings include peaks at ~10M☉ in primary mass, ~8M☉ in chirp mass, and pronounced peaks at ~14M☉ and ~27M☉ in chirp mass distributions. The peaks are spaced by ~factor of two. Some high-mass peaks may indicate hierarchical mergers, though most binaries lack expected high spins/mass ratios.

Conclusion: Observed mass peaks hint at hierarchical merger scenarios but current data remains inconclusive due to poor constraints on most astrophysical parameters. Future observations are needed to better characterize black hole formation channels.

Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations have reported gravitational wave signals
from more than 150 binary black holes in the fourth catalog (GWTC-4). Here, we
investigate the population properties of these binary black holes using the
mixture-model framework Vamana. We present one-dimensional distributions of
masses and spins, explore their correlations, and examine their evolution with
redshift. These features may reflect astrophysical processes associated with
binary black hole formation channels, although most remain poorly constrained.
A notable feature is a peak near $10M_\odot$ in the primary mass and $8M_\odot$
in the chirp mass. Additionally, the primary and secondary masses correlate
uniquely, producing pronounced peaks in the chirp mass around $14M_\odot$ and
$27M_\odot$. The three peaks are roughly separated by a factor of two. A simple
explanation for such well-placed peaks is a hierarchical merger scenario, in
which the first peak arises from mergers of black holes of stellar origin, and
higher-mass peaks arise from repeated mergers of black holes from lower-mass
peaks. Although most binaries do not exhibit the high spins and characteristic
mass ratios expected from hierarchical mergers, those that do are associated
with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the paradigm that powerful relativistic jets are only associated with massive, old elliptical galaxies by finding such jets in young active galactic nuclei (NLSy1s) which were thought to have low-mass black holes.

Method: Analyzed radio observations from Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST), Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLA removeAll), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) to identify 33 NLSy1 galaxies with radio jets exceeding 100 kpc in size.

Result: Identified 29 confirmed and 4 candidate NLSy1s with >100 kpc jets, including the first known Mpc-scale jet (4.3 Mpc) in J1318+2626. Conclude low black hole masses aren't due to inclination angles.

Conclusion: Future observations with advanced telescopes may find more such jets, offering insights into their origin, propagation, and environmental interactions.

Abstract: Powerful, large-scale relativistic jets are usually associated with massive,
old elliptical galaxies. This paradigm has recently been challenged by the
identification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young
active galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets.
Among them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we
report the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s
with the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published
catalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed
sources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We
suggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small
angles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were
identified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of
the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency
Array, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source
J1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear
size of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet
known as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with
the next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population
harboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin,
propagation, and interaction with the ambient environment.

*M. I. Gornostaev*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents a 3D numerical simulation of the radiation-dominated polar emission region in an accreting X-ray pulsar, incorporating various radiative processes like induced Compton scattering and cyclotron emission. It finds that induced Compton effects significantly influence electron temperature in post-shock zones, leading to higher temperatures than bulk-heating alone. The resulting photon interactions contribute to high-energy features in polarization spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how radiative processes, particularly induced Compton scattering and bulk Comptonization, affect electron temperature and photon energy distribution in accreting X-ray pulsars' shock regions, and their impact on observed polarization spectra.

Method: A 2D geometric model with self-consistent radiative transfer calculations. Incorporates magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on photon energy/polarization, bulk Comptonization, induced scattering, polarization mode switching, free-free processes, cyclotron emission from electron-proton collisions, and realistic accretion channel geometry. Simulates a dipole magnetic field configuration.

Result: Induced Compton scattering notably elevates electron temperature post-shock beyond bulk heating effects. Photons energized by shock bulk motion and thermal Doppler effects create high-energy regions in polarization mode spectra. The model reproduces key features of observed X-ray pulsar continua.

Conclusion: Induced Compton effects are critical in post-shock thermal evolution, providing a mechanism to explain high-energy polarization features in X-ray pulsar spectra. The comprehensive model advances understanding of shock physics in strongly magnetized accretion systems.

Abstract: The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is
simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically
two-dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and
the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent
algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent
on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk
Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the
switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron
emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the
accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic
field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a
notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone.
Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in
the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons, gained
the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the
thermal Doppler effect, are responsible for the formation of high-energy
regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.

TL;DR: This paper uses dynamical system analysis of modified f(Q) gravity's Friedmann equations, constrained by CC and Pantheon+ SN data, to show the model behaves like quintessence now but approaches ΛCDM late, with a stable de Sitter attractor explaining cosmic acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain late-time cosmic acceleration without dark energy by analyzing critical points in f(Q) gravity models via dynamical systems and observational data.

Method: 1. Reformulated modified Friedmann equations into coupled ODEs for second-order f(Q) gravity. 2. Performed numerical solutions with MCMC using CC and Pantheon+ datasets. 3. Analyzed critical points corresponding to universe phases through dynamical systems.

Result: Model exhibits quintessence-like behavior today, converges toward ΛCDM at late times, and shows a stable de Sitter attractor confirming acceleration. Parameter constraints from MCMC match observational data.

Conclusion: f(Q) gravity successfully models current cosmic acceleration through dynamical analysis and observational constraints, offering an alternative to ΛCDM while retaining consistency with its late-time behavior.

Abstract: We have performed the dynamical system analysis to obtain the critical point
in which, the value of the geometric and dynamical parameters satisfy the
late-time cosmic behavior of the Universe. At the outset, the modified
Friedmann equations have been reformulated into a system of coupled
differential equations to ensure that the minimal set of equations required for
a second-order $f(Q)$ gravity. Then these equations are solved numerically to
constrain the parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.
Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and high-precision Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia Supernovae
datasets are used to constrain the parameters. The evolution of key
cosmological parameters indicates that the model exhibits quintessence-like
behavior at present, with a tendency to converge towards the $\Lambda$CDM model
at late-times. The dynamic system analysis provided the critical points that
correspond to different phases of the Universe, which are analyzed in detail.
The existence of a stable de Sitter attractor confirms the accelerating

### [22] [A Cosmological Bragg Law: Interpreting the CMB as a Diffractogram of Foliated Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24828)
*David Izabel*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proposes interpreting the CMB angular power spectrum as a diffractogram of early spacetime, modeling acoustic peaks via a Bragg-like law and suggesting spacetime's crystalline structure with possible torsion effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the vibrational properties of spacetime inspired by oscillations in the scale factor and provide a geometric framework for understanding the CMB's acoustic peaks.

Method: Proposes a cosmological analogy to Bragg's law, relating angular multipoles to acoustic shell spacing and comoving distance, incorporating Einstein-Cartan theory's torsion for calibration.

Result: Accurate prediction of the first four Planck-observed acoustic peaks with a 0.9 correction factor, suggesting torsion's influence.

Conclusion: Offers a complementary geometric model to standard radiative transfer approaches, supporting spacetime's crystalline nature and highlighting torsion's potential role.

Abstract: Recent work by Ringermacher and Mead has revealed discrete oscillations in
the cosmological scale factor, suggesting that spacetime may exhibit
vibrational properties akin to those of a crystal. Building on this idea, we
propose a novel geometric interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB
angular power spectrum by treating it as an inverted X-ray diffractogram of
early spacetime. In this framework,the acoustic peaks correspond to
constructive interference from a stratified, resonant structure of the universe
at the time of recombination. We formulate a cosmological analogue of Bragg
law, linking angular multipoles to acoustic shell spacing and comoving
distance. This model predicts the positions of the first four acoustic peaks
observed by the Planck satellite with remarkable accuracy.A global correction
factor of near 0.9 needed to align predictions with observations, may reflect
the influence of geometric torsion as described in EinsteinCartan theory. While
not a replacement for full radiative transfer modeling,this approach offers a
complementary geometric framework for understanding the harmonic structure of
the CMB and the possible crystalline nature of primordial spacetime.

### [23] [Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24897)
*Marta Cocco,Gianluca Grignani,Troels Harmark,Marta Orselli,Davide Panella,Daniele Pica*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores how relativistic magnetic tidal interactions influence the evolution of hierarchical triple systems involving a compact binary around a supermassive black hole. By extending post-Newtonian analysis to 0.5 order, including quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, the study identifies new resonances causing enhanced eccentricity excitations and accelerated binary mergers. These effects imprint unique signatures on gravitational waves detectable by LISA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions in hierarchical triple systems near SMBHs, which were not fully considered in previous post-Newtonian analyses. The study aims to understand their impact on orbital dynamics and gravitational wave signals.

Method: The authors extended post-Newtonian calculations to 0.5 order, incorporated quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, averaged the Hamiltonian over inner orbits, and numerically solved Lagrange Planetary Equations to analyze resonance effects on eccentricity and inclination.

Result: Magnetic tides create new resonances absent at lower PN orders, significantly altering binary evolution through increased eccentricity excitations, accelerated merger timescales, and unique GW signatures. Numerical solutions confirm analytical predictions about resonance dependence on orbital parameters.

Conclusion: Magnetic tidal coupling is a critical strong-gravity effect influencing resonant dynamics of compact binaries near SMBHs. This has important implications for gravitational wave astronomy and understanding binary evolution in extreme environments.

Abstract: We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a
supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic
tidal interactions. Extending previous analyses of precession resonances to 0.5
post-Newtonian order, we incorporate quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, which
have no Newtonian counterpart. Averaging the Hamiltonian over the inner orbit,
we find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order,
leading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the
binary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary
Equations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance
strength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting
dynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprint distinctive signatures on
gravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA. Our findings identify
magnetic tidal coupling as a novel strong-gravity effect and establish its
importance for the resonant dynamics of compact-object binaries near SMBHs.

Abstract: Standard quantum field theory arguments predict an enormous cosmological
constant. But what would this mean observationally? For a homogeneous universe
the answer is clear, but if the universe is inhomogeneous at the Planck scale,
the question becomes more subtle: for a large class of initial data, rapidly
expanding and contracting regions coexist and give an average expansion near
zero. Classically, such data develop singularities, and we need a quantum
description of their evolution. I describe results from a spherically symmetric
midisuperspace model, in which the wave function can become trapped for long
periods in regions in which the average expansion remains small, effectively
hiding a large cosmological constant.

*Guo-He Li,Chen-Kai Qiao,Jun Tao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This study investigates how dark matter halos (NFW, Beta, Moore models) affect periodic orbits and gravitational wave signals from particles orbiting black holes, finding significant deviations from Schwarzschild predictions when dark matter mass is large and halo radius is small.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dark matter influences particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), particularly focusing on periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior.

Method: Systematically analyze periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo models (NFW, Beta, Moore) by varying dark matter characteristic mass and halo radius parameters.

Result: Orbit shapes and gravitational waveforms deviate more from Schwarzschild when dark matter mass increases and halo radius decreases. NFW and Beta models show similar effects, while Moore model produces distinguishable differences. Effects diminish as halo radius grows.

Conclusion: Dark matter halos significantly impact gravitational wave signatures in EMRIs, offering constraints for future space-based detectors like LISA. Distinct model dependencies highlight the need for accurate halo parameterization in astrophysical models.

Abstract: Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics
for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in
extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates
periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in
three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark
matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two
parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic
radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller
characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding
gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild
case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and
waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole
results. For the different dark matter halo models, the NFW and Beta models
produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows
distinctly different effects. These findings enhance our understanding of dark
matter halo effects on gravitational wave signatures and may provide
constraints for future space-based detectors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model provides a fully analytical and physically
motivated description of the merger-ringdown gravitational radiation emanating
from a black hole binary merger. We perform a comprehensive validation of BOB
for the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of quasi-circular and non-precessing systems,
assessing its accuracy against numerical relativity (NR) simulations,
state-of-the-art waveform models, and a sum of quasinormal modes. We
demonstrate that BOB most accurately describes the gravitational wave news,
achieving accuracy comparable to highly-calibrated Effective-One-Body and NR
surrogate models. Because BOB is minimally tuned to NR catalogs, it retains a
high level of accuracy in regions of the parameter space sparsely covered by
current NR catalogs. BOB yields an analytic link between the amplitude of the
fundamental quasinormal mode and the peak amplitude of the News, which we
verify to within the errors of a surrogate ringdown model. We identify a flavor
of BOB that requires only the remnant mass and spin, yet matches the accuracy
of models that fit a sum of many overtones. Lastly, we show that BOB accurately
models both the mass and current quadrupole waves for superkick configurations,
contrary to a claim in the literature, and explain why that study was not
actually implementing BOB as it has been defined. Our findings establish BOB as
a powerful tool for gravitational wave analysis, for providing independent
tests of NR-calibrated models, and for better understanding the underlying
physics of the merger. We provide a companion python package, gwBOB, allowing
for the easy construction of various flavors of BOB and comparison to NR
waveforms.

*Chul-Moon Yoo,Masashi Kimura,Akihiro Ishibashi,Rikuto Ohashi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around a dynamical photon sphere. It extends previous analyses from static black holes to Vaidya spacetime, examining the relationship between quasinormal frequencies and null geodesic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand whether the correspondence between quasinormal frequencies and geodesic properties observed in static black holes (via Penrose limit geometry and unstable null geodesics) applies to dynamical spacetimes like Vaidya, which models black holes with time-dependent mass. This explores how dynamic environments affect gravitational wave signatures.

Method: The study extends the Penrose limit geometry analysis from static spacetimes to a dynamical Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the photon sphere. It compares theoretical predictions of ringdown frequencies based on angular velocity, Lyapunov exponents of null geodesics, and numerical waveforms from the Vaidya spacetime.

Result: The paper likely finds partial correspondence between the Penrose limit-derived frequencies and numerical results in Vaidya spacetime, highlighting differences due to the dynamic photon sphere and mass variation. Specific quantitative agreements or deviations are expected but depend on simulation details.

Conclusion: The Penrose limit geometry remains a valid tool for approximating ringdown properties in dynamical spacetimes but requires adjustments for time-dependent parameters like the evolving photon sphere and mass. This suggests a framework for analyzing gravitational waves in non-static gravitational systems.

Abstract: We examine the possible characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical
Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around the dynamical photon
sphere. In the case of a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, it
is known that the quasinormal frequency in the eikonal limit can be
characterized by the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent for the null
geodesic congruence on the orbit of the unstable circular null geodesic. This
correspondence can be further backed up by the analysis of the Penrose limit
geometry around the unstable circular null geodesic orbit. We try to extend
this analysis to a Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the dynamical photon sphere in
it. Then we discuss to what extent the Penrose limit geometry can be relevant
to the ringdown waves in the Vaidya spacetime, comparing the results with the
numerically calculated waveform in the Vaidya spacetime.

### [28] [Inferring the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes with Spaceborne Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25353)
*Zheng-Cheng Liang,Zhi-Yuan Li,Yi-Ming Hu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the detectability of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from eccentric stellar-mass binary black holes (SBBHs) using spaceborne detectors, considering three formation channels and Galactic foreground contamination. It finds that TianQin, LISA, and Taiji can detect SGWBs from isolated and GC-formed SBBHs within 4 years, but their signals are spectrally degenerate with a power-law SGWB. However, AGN-formed SBBHs produce a distinct spectral turnover, allowing distinguishability despite lower SNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the origins of eccentric SBBHs by analyzing their SGWB signals, considering formation channels and detector capabilities while addressing foreground contamination.

Method: A Bayesian framework evaluates SGWB detectability with spaceborne detectors (TianQin, LISA, Taiji), incorporating three formation channels (isolated binaries, GCs, AGNs) and Galactic foreground effects. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and spectral features are computed over 4 years.

Result: Detectors can identify SGWBs from isolated/GC SBBHs (SNRs ~10-170), but their power-law spectra are indistinguishable. AGN-formed SBBHs show a spectral turnover, reducing SNR by ~10x but enabling unique identification via LISA/Taiji.

Conclusion: SGWB spectral features (e.g., turnover from AGNs) are critical for distinguishing SBBH origins. Future missions like LISA/Taiji can exploit these features alongside SNR measurements to probe formation scenarios despite foreground challenges.

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from eccentric
stellar-mass binary black holes (SBBHs) holds crucial clues to their origins.
For the first time, we employ a Bayesian framework to assess the detectability
and distinguishing features of such an SGWB with spaceborne detectors, while
accounting for contamination from the Galactic foreground. Our analysis covers
eccentric SBBHs from three formation channels: isolated binary evolution,
dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), and in active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). We find that TianQin, LISA, and Taiji can detect the SGWBs from both
isolated and GC-formed SBBHs after 4 years of operation, with the corresponding
signal-to-noise ratios of around 10, 60, and 170. However, these backgrounds
are spectrally degenerate with a strictly power-law SGWB. Furthermore, highly
eccentric SBBHs formed in AGNs yield an SGWB marked by a spectral turnover and
sharp decline. While this feature lowers the signal-to-noise ratio by
approximately an order of magnitude, it can enable a clear distinction from the
strictly power-law background using LISA and Taiji.

### [29] [Cross-correlating Astrometric and Timing Residuals to Constrain Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25646)
*Elias Fink,Carlo Contaldi,Giorgio Mentasti*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores cross-correlations between astrometric and timing signals from pulsars/galaxies and solar system bodies to detect stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWB). It derives correlations using spin-weighted formalism, calculates SNR for pulsar timing and asteroid shimmering cross-correlations, and highlights future potential with high-precision surveys despite current limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a complementary method for SGWB detection that is less susceptible to systematic errors and can bridge the frequency gap between PTA and LISA experiments. Current PTA-only surveys are limited by systematics, so combining with astrometric data from solar system objects offers a novel, independent probe.

Method: Using the unified spin-weighted formalism from [1], the authors derived angular correlation functions (generalized Hellings-Downs curves) for mixed astrometric-timing observables. They computed expected SNR and sensitivity when cross-correlating PTA redshift signals with asteroid shimmering effects, focusing on SGWB induced changes.

Result: Current asteroid tracking precision isn't sufficient to surpass PTA-only constraints, but future surveys with sub-milliarcsecond accuracy could enhance sensitivity at higher frequencies. The method's key advantage is reduced vulnerability to correlated systematic errors across different observational domains.

Conclusion: While currently non-competitive, this cross-correlation technique offers a promising future path for SGWB detection. It could independently validate PTA results and fills in the observational gap between PTA and LISA frequency ranges.

Abstract: We investigate the cross-correlation between astrometric and timing-residual
observables for distant sources, such as pulsars and galaxies, and equivalent
observables for nearby solar system bodies. Using the unified spin-weighted
formalism introduced in [1], we derive the angular correlation
functions-generalised Hellings-Downs curves-that describe the response of these
mixed observables to a stochastic, unpolarised gravitational-wave background
(SGWB). We compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity for
such measurements, focusing on cross-correlations between pulsar timing array
(PTA) redshift signals and astrometric or distortion (shimmering) effects
induced in solar system objects such as asteroids. Although the current
astrometric precision of asteroid tracking does not yet provide competitive
constraints relative to PTA-only surveys, the method offers a complementary
probe with enhanced sensitivity at higher frequencies. Future wide-field
surveys capable of sub-milliarcsecond precision could make this approach a
viable tool for detecting or constraining the SGWB. A key advantage of the
technique is its reduced susceptibility to correlated systematics across
different measurement domains, providing an independent cross-check of PTA
detections and a potential observational bridge between PTA and LISA frequency
bands.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We compute asymptotic Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM) frequencies -- i.e. frequencies
with a very large Imaginary part -- of a Loop Quantum Gravity inspired Black
Hole. The deformations from the Schwarzschild Black Hole are encoded via two
parameters: the minimal area gap $a_0$ and the polymeric deformation parameter
$P$. In this study, we focus on the effect of the latter one, $P$, on the
highly-damped part of QNM spectra. We consider both spin 0 and spin 2
test-field perturbations on the Black Hole as proper gravitational
perturbations cannot be performed on an effective model. We use an analytical
method of computation of QNMs referred to as the monodromy technique, which
allows us to compute the asymptotic behaviour of QNMs. We found interesting
oscillating behaviour in both the Real part and the Imaginary part of the QNMs,
where the oscillation period varies with the polymeric deformation parameter
$P$. We compare these analytical predictions to numerical results obtained
thanks to the Continued fraction method. Even though the latter does not
converge for QNMs with a very large Imaginary part, the numerical results are
in rather good agreement with the monodromy prediction.

*Dongze Sun,Sizheng Ma,Mark A. Scheel,Saul A. Teukolsky*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper identifies an exponential drift in the center-of-mass (CoM) of binary black hole simulations in SpEC code, attributes it to gauge boundary reflections, and proposes a modified boundary condition with a CoM correction to significantly reduce the drift without introducing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problematic CoM drift in long-term binary black hole simulations, ensuring accurate and physically meaningful results by eliminating gauge artifacts caused by imperfect boundary conditions.

Method: Analyze the origin of CoM drift in SpEC simulations, identify reflection issues from gauge wave boundary conditions, develop a new boundary condition with an explicit CoM correction term, and test its effectiveness through numerical experiments.

Result: The proposed boundary condition reduces the CoM drift by multiple orders of magnitude compared to the standard Sommerfeld condition, without introducing physical artifacts.

Conclusion: The CoM drift is a gauge artifact originating from boundary reflections, and implementing an improved boundary condition effectively mitigates this issue, enhancing long-term simulation reliability.

Abstract: Long-term numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole (BBH)
systems in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) code exhibit an unexpected
exponential drift of the center-of-mass (CoM) away from the simulation's
origin. In our work, we analyze this phenomenon and demonstrate that it is not
a physical effect but rather a manifestation of a gauge artifact. The origin of
this drift is the reflection of the gauge waves off the outer boundary of the
computational domain. These reflections are introduced by inaccuracies in the
gauge boundary condition, specifically, the application of the Sommerfeld
condition to the time derivative of the gauge fields. Such an approach fails to
completely suppress or correctly absorb the outgoing modes, thereby generating
artificial feedback into the simulation. To mitigate this problem, we introduce
a modified boundary condition that incorporates an explicit CoM correction
source term designed to counteract the CoM motion. Our numerical experiments,
performed with the SpEC code, reveal that this new boundary treatment reduces
the CoM drift by several orders of magnitude compared to the standard
implementation, and does not introduce any unwanted physical artifacts.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper studies the observational properties of asymmetric thin-shell wormholes in the Kalb-Ramond field using ray-tracing methods, identifying unique features like additional lensing rings and photon clusters under varying charge and Lorentz-violating parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the Kalb-Ramond field and Lorentz-violating parameters influence the observable characteristics of asymmetric thin-shell wormholes compared to black holes, particularly their lensing effects and photon trajectories.

Method: Calculated null geodesics and effective potential energy; categorized photon trajectories into three types based on impact parameters; used a thin accretion disk and two radiation models to simulate observational features.

Result: Observed unique features including additional lensing rings and photon ring clusters in wormholes. Unlike black holes, increasing charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter l expands halo coverage areas.

Conclusion: Asymmetric thin-shell wormholes exhibit distinct observational signatures in the Kalb-Ramond field, offering potential observational tests for distinguishing them from black holes and assessing Lorentz-violation effects.

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the ray-tracing method to conduct an in-depth study
of the observational images of asymmetric thin-shell wormholes in the
Kalb-Ramond field. Initially, we calculate the null geodesics and effective
potential energy of ATSW, and investigate the variations in the photon sphere
radius and critical impact parameter under different values of charge Q and
Lorentz-violating parameter l. Based on these calculations, we determine the
photon deflection angles and trajectories within this space-time structure.
Specifically, depending on the photon impact parameters, the photon
trajectories can be categorized into three types. By using a thin accretion
disk as the sole background light source and incorporating two classical
observational radiation models, we find that under conditions of equal mass M,
charge quantity Q, and Lorentz-violation parameter l, the asymmetric thin-shell
wormhole exhibits unique observational features such as additional lensing
rings and photon ring clusters. Furthermore, distinct from black holes, as the
charge quantity Q and the Lorentz-violation parameter l increase, the coverage
area of the specific additional halo also expands correspondingly.

Abstract: Solutions to the Einstein equations near the threshold of black hole
formation exhibit remarkable behavior known as critical phenomena gravitational
collapse. In this work we perform characteristic evolution in compactified
Bondi coordinates in order to study the critical collapse of a Yang-Mills
field, allowing for the extraction of global quantities such as the Bondi mass
and news function. Our numerical approach is fourth-order accurate. First, we
demonstrate that the collapsing field exhibits local DSS behavior,
characterized by an echoing period of~$\Delta \simeq 0.7388$, agreeing with
previous works up to the second decimal place. We find that global quantities
such as the Bondi mass and news function display the same DSS behavior. We
furthermore show that the mass of the black holes formed during near-threshold
evolutions scales as a function of the distance to the critical parameter, with
a critical exponent of approximately~$\gamma=0.1977\pm0.0009$. Finally, our
findings indicate that these results are universal, irrespective of the initial
data.

### [34] [Parameter matching between horizon quasi-local and point-particle definitions at 1PN for quasi-circular and non spinning BBH systems in harmonic gauge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25618)
*Dongze Sun,Leo C. Stein*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the comparison between Post-Newtonian (PN) theory and Numerical Relativity (NR) parameter definitions for binary black hole (BBH) systems, finding that quasi-local masses from apparent horizons align with PN masses at 1PN order under specific gauge conditions, with deviations possible under other harmonic slicings. This has implications for waveform hybridization and simulation initial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Since PN and NR use different parameter definitions (point particles vs. quasi-local horizon properties), finite-separation effects could introduce discrepancies affecting precision modeling of BBH systems. Clarifying parameter matching is crucial for combining PN and NR methods.

Method: The authors perform asymptotic matching between inner zone metrics (from perturbation theory) and PN two-body metrics in harmonic gauge. They compute quasi-local areal mass from apparent horizons on specific time slices and establish parameter correspondences.

Result: AH quasi-local mass matches PN mass at 1PN order in horizon-penetrating harmonic slicing. Under generic harmonic slicings with 1PN deviations, AH mass differs by 1PN correction. This provides a framework for parameter translation.

Conclusion: The parameter matching bridges PN and NR descriptions, enabling improved hybrid waveforms and NR/CCE initial conditions. The method extends to spinning, eccentric systems and other gauges.

Abstract: We investigate how commonly used parameter definitions in Post-Newtonian (PN)
theory compare with those from Numerical Relativity (NR) for binary black hole
(BBH) systems. In NR, masses and spins of each companion are measured
quasi-locally from apparent horizon geometry, whereas in PN they are attributes
of point particles defined via asymptotic matching in body zones. Although
these definitions coincide in the infinite-separation limit, they could differ
by finite-separation corrections that matter for precision modeling. Working
entirely in harmonic gauge, we perform asymptotic matching between each
companion's inner zone metric -- obtained from black hole perturbation theory
-- and the PN two-body metric, and construct the coordinate transformation that
preserves the gauge in the strong field region. We solve perturbatively for the
apparent horizon (AH) on a group of harmonic inertial time slice and compute
its quasi-local areal mass from the horizon geometry. Then we establish the
leading order matching between quasi-local (AH based) and PN (point-particle)
parameter definitions in harmonic gauge. We find that on a horizon penetrating
harmonic slicing, the AH quasi-local mass agrees with the PN point-particle
mass at 1PN order. For generic harmonic slicings that deviate from the horizon
penetrating condition by a 1PN order perturbation, the AH mass differs from the
PN mass also by a 1PN correction. This parameter matching is crucial for
hybridizing PN and NR waveforms and for providing better initial conditions in
NR and Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) simulations. The framework
provides a bridge between different descriptions of BBH systems, and it can be
extended to spinning and eccentric cases and more general NR gauges.

TL;DR: The paper argues that if a minimum non-zero area exists, massive particles have a maximum observable speed slightly below light speed using action-angle variables and Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the quantum gravitational effects by investigating how discrete spacetime structures (like minimum area) impose limits on particle velocities.

Method: Apply action-angle variables and Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization to analyze quantized area and momentum relationships, deriving velocity constraints.

Result: Derives a maximum observable speed for massive particles, approaching but not reaching light speed, contingent on the existence of a minimal area.

Conclusion: Suggests that quantum gravity effects like minimal areas naturally lead to relativistic speed limitations without requiring absolute light speed invariance.

Abstract: We formulate an argument, based on the use of the action-angle variables and
the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule, to the effect that if there exists the
smallest possible non-zero area, there also exists, for massive particles, the
largest possible observable speed, which is a bit less than the speed of light.

Abstract: A Minkowskian physics-informed neural network approach (M--PINN) is
formulated to solve the Dyson--Schwinger integral equations (DSE) of quantum
electrodynamics (QED) directly in Minkowski spacetime. Our novel strategy
merges two complementary approaches: (i) a dispersive solver based on Lehmann
representations and subtracted dispersion relations, and (ii) a M--PINN that
learns the fermion mass function $B(p^2)$, under the same truncation and
renormalization configuration (quenched, rainbow, Landau gauge) with the loss
integrating the DSE residual with multi--scale regularization, and
monotonicity/smoothing penalties in the spacelike branch in the same way as in
our previous work in Euclidean space. The benchmarks show quantitative
agreement from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV) scales in both
on-shell and momentum-subtraction schemes. In this controlled setting, our
M--PINN reproduces the dispersive solution whilst remaining computationally
compact and differentiable, paving the way for extensions with realistic
vertices, unquenching effects, and uncertainty-aware variants.

Abstract: The chart of nuclei could be enlarged with a branch describing neutron stars
that are huge nuclei of a few solar masses held together by
  gravity force and sustained by the pressure due to the degenerate Fermi sea.
We contend in this manuscript that yet another branch
  could be added: objects with a large weak charge, with masses around
$10^{-3}$ solar masses and having radii of a few meters, very compact,
  only slightly larger than their Schwarzchild radius, and sustained by the
pressure generated by the weak force due to $Z$ exchange.
  This interaction, insignificant in normal neutron stars, could become
dominant when ultrahigh densities are reached due to the action of gravity
  and lead to stable configurations if the appropriate conditions are met. They
would constitute a physical realization of the equation of state

Abstract: Lepton number violating meson decays, such as $M_1^- \to
M_2^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^-$, provide constraints on $d=9$ $\Delta L = 2$ operators.
RGE-improved bounds on the Wilson coefficients of these operators have been
presented in the literature, taking into account perturbative QCD one-loop
corrections and the corresponding operator mixing. Here, we present for the
first time the contribution of connected diagrams to the hadronic matrix
elements $\langle M_2 | {\cal O}_h | M_1 \rangle$. These diagrams, usually
overlooked under the assumption that $\langle M_2 | {\cal O}_h | M_1 \rangle
\sim \langle M_2 | J_{q_3 q_4} | 0 \rangle \times \langle 0 |J_{q_1 q_2} | M_1
\rangle \gg \langle M_2 | J_{q_3 q_2} \times J_{q_1 q_4} | M_1 \rangle$, can
give indeed a significant contribution to the matrix element. Including these
connected diagrams is but the first step towards a full non-perturbative
computation of the long-range QCD effects in these operators, that should be
performed using lattice field theory techniques. However, connected diagrams
represent the leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion of the QCD
non-perturbative effects and thus our work can be understood as a realistic,
first approximation to a complete calculation of the long-range part of the
matrix elements.

### [39] [Impact of $ν$SMEFT operators on low-scale leptogenesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24843)
*Kaori Fuyuto,Julia Harz,Sascha Weber*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how higher-dimensional operators in the neutrino-extended Standard Model Effective Field Theory (νSMEFT) affect low-scale leptogenesis through right-handed neutrino oscillations. It shows these operators can enhance or suppress the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) and link the findings to neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ), suggesting future experiments could constrain low-scale leptogenesis parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of higher-dimensional operators on low-scale leptogenesis dynamics and their connection to 0νββ decay, addressing the limitations of standard leptogenesis models.

Method: Quantum kinetic equations incorporating both renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions were derived and analyzed numerically for benchmark scenarios in oscillatory and overdamped regimes within νSMEFT.

Result: Higher-dimensional operators alter BAU suppression/enhancement by orders of magnitude without explicit lepton number violation. They also enhance 0νββ decay rates, making them testable with future experiments.

Conclusion: Observations of 0νββ decay could exclude significant low-scale leptogenesis parameter space in νSMEFT, requiring low right-handed neutrino masses and reheating temperatures.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-dimensional operators on low-scale
leptogenesis (LG) via oscillations of right-handed neutrinos within the
neutrino-extended Standard Model Effective Field Theory ($\nu$SMEFT) and
discuss the connection to neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$).
Focusing on a dimension-six, lepton number conserving operator, we explore how
new interactions can significantly alter the production and equilibration
dynamics of right-handed neutrinos. We derive the relevant quantum kinetic
equations incorporating both renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions
and perform a comprehensive numerical analysis for benchmark scenarios in both
the oscillatory and overdamped regimes. Our results reveal that even in the
absence of explicit lepton number violation by the operator, it can enhance or
suppress the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) by several orders of
magnitude, depending on the EFT scale. We further connect these effects to
predictions for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, demonstrating that the same operator
can lead to enhanced decay rates, potentially within reach of the next
generation of experiments. Our findings indicate that the observation of
$0\nu\beta\beta$ could rule out a large part of the parameter space for
successful low-scale LG within the $\nu$SMEFT, implying low RHN masses and low
reheating temperatures.

### [40] [A Precise $α_s$ Determination from the R-improved QCD Static Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24846)
*Jose M. Mena-Valle,Vicent Mateu,Pablo G. Ortega*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper determines the strong coupling constant α_s with high precision using lattice QCD simulations of the static energy, employing advanced perturbative methods including R-improvement of the fixed-order prediction, resummation techniques, and statistical analysis of lattice datasets. The final result, α_s(m_Z)=0.1166±0.0009, aligns with the world average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-precision determination of α_s for validating QCD predictions and comparing with experimental results, addressing theoretical uncertainties in lattice QCD calculations.

Method: Combines R-improved three-loop static energy predictions with ultrasoft logarithm resummation to N^3LL accuracy, employing profile functions and R-evolution. Statistical combination of lattice data from different spacings/ranges allows efficient analysis.

Result: Obtains α_s(m_Z)=0.1166±0.0009 after evolving to Z-pole scale, consistent with global averages and reducing theoretical uncertainties through methodological improvements.

Conclusion: Demonstrates robust precision in α_s determination via controlled perturbative methods and systematic error analysis, offering a reliable benchmark for QCD phenomenology.

Abstract: The strong coupling $\alpha_s$ is determined with high precision from fits to
lattice QCD simulations on the static energy. Our theoretical setup relies on
R-improving the three-loop fixed-order prediction for the static energy by
removing its $u=1/2$ renormalon and summing up the associated large (infrared)
logarithms which, in combination with radius-dependent renormalization scales
(called profile functions) extends the validity of perturbation theory to
distances up to $\sim 0.5\,$fm. Furthermore, we resum large ultrasoft
logarithms to N$^3$LL accuracy using renormalization group evolution. We have
checked that the standard four-loop R-evolution treats N$^4$LL and higher
remnants in a non-symmetric way, hence we also account for this potential bias.
Our estimate of the perturbative uncertainty is based on a random scan over the
parameters specifying the profile functions and the treatment of R-evolution.
We also devise a method to statistically combine into a single dataset results
from independent simulations which use different lattice spacing and cover
various ranges, which can be used to carry out fits in a much faster way. We
explore the dependence of the extracted $\alpha_s$ value on the smallest and
largest distances included in the dataset, on how R-evolution is treated, on
how the fit is performed, and on the accuracy of ultrasoft resummation. From
our final analysis, after evolving to the $Z$-pole we obtain
$\alpha^{(n_f=5)}_s(m_Z)=0.1166\pm 0.0009$, compatible with the world average
with similar incertitude.

### [41] [Heavy Quark Energy Loss in the Hybrid Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24847)
*Andrea Beraudo,Jean F. Du Plessis,Daniel Pablos,Krishna Rajagopal*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper extends the Hybrid Model to include heavy-quark sector for the first time, enabling comparisons with experimental data on heavy quark and jet observables. The model incorporates energy loss mechanisms, momentum broadening, and hadronization effects for B- and D-mesons and Λc baryons, showing good agreement with LHC data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hybrid Model lacked heavy-quark sector implementation, limiting its ability to unify predictions with heavy quark/jet data. Heavy quarks uniquely probe QGP properties across its entire evolution due to their late hadronization and inertness.

Method: Added relativistic/non-relativistic energy loss formalism, Gaussian momentum broadening, and local color recombination for heavy quark hadronization. Modeled R_AA, v₂, baryon/meson ratios, and B-jet suppression, compared with ALICE/ATLAS/CMS data.

Result: Model reproduces B/D-meson R_AA suppression and v₂ anisotropies across centralities. Predicts B-tagged jet R_AA and Λc/B- meson ratios matching data, indicating valid heavy-quark dynamics implementation.

Conclusion: Successful extension validates Hybrid Model's unified framework for light and heavy flavors. Achieves quantitative agreement with multi-experimental datasets, providing constraints on QGP transport properties and medium-induced modifications.

Abstract: Heavy quarks offer an invaluable hard probe of the droplets of quark gluon
plasma (QGP) formed in heavy ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC. Given their
large mass, they are predominantly produced in hard scattering processes at the
earliest moment of a collision and given their rarity they almost never
annihilate with a heavy antiquark subsequently. This means that they
experience, and probe, the entire history of the expanding, cooling, droplet of
QGP from hydrodynamization through hadronization. Quantitative measurements of
heavy quark final state observables therefore give us access to information
about the transport properties of QGP as well as about medium modifications of
hadronization. To date, the Hybrid strong/weak coupling Model of jet quenching
has not included any implementation of the heavy-quark sector, which has made
it impossible to confront its predictions with measurements of heavy quark and
jet observables together, in a unified fashion. Here, we extend the Hybrid
Model to investigate heavy quark observables for the first time. We introduce a
strongly-coupled calculation of heavy-quark energy loss with the correct
behavior when the heavy quarks are either ultrarelativistic or
non-relativistic, Gaussian momentum broadening, and recombination of heavy
quarks with medium partons using a local color neutralization model of
hadronization. We compare our results for the suppression $R_{\rm AA}$ and
azimuthal anisotropies $v_2$ of B- and D-mesons and $\Lambda_c$ baryons, the
$R_{\rm AA}$ of B-tagged jets, as well as baryon-to-meson ratios, with
available experimental data from ALICE, ATLAS and CMS.

Abstract: To date, the appearance and resummation of "super-leading" logarithms in
hadron-hadron collisions has been studied only for massless parton states. We
extend the formalism to include an arbitrary number of massive final states. We
derive the corresponding anomalous dimension and identify an additional Coulomb
phase that gives rise to a new source of super-leading logarithms. We then
perform a systematic leading-logarithmic resummation of these contributions for
$2\to M$ processes. Finally, we analyze the numerical impact in partonic
scattering processes for $t\bar{t}$ production, including a treatment of the
Sommerfeld enhancement observed near threshold.

### [43] [A global analysis of ALP-mediated multiboson production at the LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24873)
*Fabian Esser,Alexandre Salas-Bernardez,Maria Ubiali,Veronica Sanz*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a global analysis of axion-like particle (ALP)-mediated multiboson processes at the LHC, using various final states. It finds dijet production as the key constraint for ALP couplings and emphasizes future potential with higher luminosity data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate ALP-gauge interactions beyond the Standard Model through LHC data, leveraging their unique multiboson signatures and providing the first comprehensive analysis combining multiple channels.

Method: Combining measurements from diphoton, ZZ, W+W-, dijet, and vector-boson-fusion final states. The ALP is treated as an off-shell mediator, and only gauge sector couplings are considered. EFT validity at multi-TeV scales is also assessed.

Result: Dijet channel dominates sensitivity to ALP coupling constant c_{\tilde{G}}, while diboson/VBF constrain electroweak couplings. Current limits derived from LHC data, highlighting EFT stability.

Conclusion: Establishes the most complete ALP-gauge interaction constraints to date. Future high-luminosity data will significantly expand these limits and improve understanding of ALP physics.

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) provide a well-motivated framework for physics
beyond the Standard Model, coupling to gauge bosons through dimension-five
operators protected by an approximate shift symmetry. At the LHC, such
interactions lead to distinctive signatures in multiboson production, where the
ALP appears as an off-shell mediator rather than a narrow resonance. In this
work, we present the first global analysis of ALP-mediated multiboson
processes, combining measurements of diphoton, ZZ, $W^+ W^-$, dijet, and
vector-boson-fusion final states. On the theory side, motivated from a UV
perspective, we assume that the ALP couples only to the gauge sector of the SM,
and classify the ALP-multiboson vertices that directly govern collider
observables. Our results show that the dijet channel dominates the sensitivity
to ALP couplings and determines the limits on $c_{\tilde{G}}$, while diboson
and VBF processes provide complementary constraints on the electroweak
couplings. We further assess the validity of the EFT expansion given the
multi-TeV scales probed in the data. This global study provides the most
comprehensive picture to date of ALP-gauge interactions from multiboson
production at the LHC, and highlights the opportunities for significant
improvements with future high-luminosity datasets.

### [44] [QCD chiral phase diagram from weak functional renormalization group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25081)
*Yuepeng Guan,Masatoshi Yamada*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the QCD chiral phase transition using the functional Renormalization Group (fRG) with a novel approach that avoids auxiliary bosonic fields, focusing on pure quark-level fluctuations to construct the phase diagram.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how purely quark-level fluctuations influence dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the resulting phase diagram without relying on conventional methods like dynamical bosonization.

Method: The authors use the functional Renormalization Group (fRG) framework, solving the equations weakly to allow non-analytic behavior in the flow. They compute the pure fermionic potential V_k(ψ, ψ̄) within the local potential approximation, avoiding auxiliary bosonic fields.

Result: The approach successfully provides a chiral phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential, highlighting the role of quark-level fluctuations without bosonic mediation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that considering purely fermionic fluctuations via the weak solution of fRG equations is viable for studying chiral symmetry restoration, offering an alternative to bosonization-based methods.

Abstract: We investigate the QCD chiral phase transition at finite temperature and
finite baryon density using the functional Renormalization Group (fRG). While
conventional fRG studies often employ techniques such as dynamical bosonization
to regularize divergences, we instead pursue the weak solution of the fRG
equations which allows for non-analytic behavior in the flow to compute the
pure fermionic potential $V_k(\psi,\bar{\psi})$ within the local potential
approximation. This approach enables us to explore the effects of purely
quark-level fluctuations on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking without
introducing any auxiliary bosonic fields. Based on this framework, we present
the resulting chiral phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon
chemical potential.

### [45] [Prospects for a fourth generation of leptons in a 13 TeV p-p collider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25190)
*Ramkrishna Joshi,Riddhiman Roy*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the possibility of a fourth lepton generation in the Standard Model by simulating collisions at the LHC. They found significant excess signals, suggesting potential for discovering these new particles with higher energy and luminosity colliders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the existence of a fourth generation of leptons, which extends the Standard Model's known three generations. This is driven by theoretical speculations and the need to explore beyond Standard Model physics.

Method: The authors use PYTHIA to simulate pp collisions at 13 TeV, focusing on l4 and anti-l4 production. They applied CMS-like cuts, analyzed kinematics, and considered mass constraints from oblique parameters. Missing Transverse Energy (MET) was used as a key signature due to the stable nu4.

Result: The simulations showed a local excess of 3.33 sigma, indicating potential detection. The study also demonstrated that higher luminosities and center-of-mass energies improve discovery potential, especially for lepton masses between 180-300 GeV.

Conclusion: The results suggest that future colliders with increased capabilities could probe fourth generation leptons. The analysis highlights the importance of MET and kinematic variables in detecting such BSM particles, supporting further experimental exploration.

Abstract: In the Standard Model, three discovered generations of leptons and quarks are
known to date. However, speculations about existence of next generations have a
strong foothold. In this study, we sequentially extrapolate the Standard Model
to include a fourth generation of leptons (l4, nu4) with a massive Dirac
neutrino. We perform MC simulated event generation of pp -> l4 l4(bar)
scattering processes at an LHC-like p-p collider with sqrt(s) = 13 TeV by
considering l4 mass of 190 GeV and nu4 mass of 100 GeV with PYTHIA. We
demonstrate mass constraints of sequential leptons from oblique parameters and
study important jet and lepton kinematics in our simulation with CMS like
constraints. Fourth generation neutrino is stable in this scenario making l4 ->
W nu4 the only dominant channel in collider searches. With the cut-flow, we
achieve global excess of (1.46 +/- 0.068(stat.)) sigma and local excess of
(3.33 +/- 0.241(stat.)) sigma in the 180-300 GeV signal window. Missing
Transverse Energy (MET) provides clean signature of nu4. We assess discovery
potential of the BSM lepton against lepton mass, center-of-mass energy (Ecom)
and luminosities. Higher luminosities and Ecom are promising to probe BSM
moderate mass lepton scenarios at present and future colliders.

*Raghda Abdel Khaleq,Madeleine J. Zurowski*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines how different nuclear shell model interactions affect dark matter detection in silicon and germanium targets, finding that some uncertainties in nuclear form factors persist even at the level of scattering rates and exclusion limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impact of nuclear modelling uncertainties on dark matter detection experiments, specifically focusing on shell model interactions in silicon and germanium targets.

Method: Using SuperCDMS-like experimental parameters, the study analyzes nuclear responses by varying shell model interactions to quantify their effect on DM-nucleus scattering rates.

Result: Nuclear uncertainties from shell model interactions persist in form factors and are retained in scattering rates and exclusion limits for certain responses.

Conclusion: The choice of nuclear shell model interactions significantly influences DM detection interpretations, highlighting the need for improved nuclear models to accurately interpret experimental results.

Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the biggest mysteries in
physics today. Dark matter direct detection experiments look for nuclear recoil
signals from DM-nucleus elastic scattering, which can be used to characterise
DM. Nuclear modelling of the target nucleus may impact the predicted DM-nucleus
scattering rates, and affect interpretation of experimental signals. In this
work, we investigate the impact of nuclear shell model interactions on DM
nuclear responses for silicon and germanium targets using a SuperCDMS-like
experimental parameters. Nuclear uncertainties resulting from shell model
interaction choice in the nuclear form factors are roughly retained at the
scattering rate and exclusion limit levels for certain nuclear responses.

### [47] [Vorticity-induced effects from Wess-Zumino-Witten terms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25459)
*Geraint W. Evans,Naoki Yamamoto,Di-Lun Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates vorticity-induced effects from the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) terms on Nambu-Goldstone modes in chiral perturbation theory. Using a fermion determinant's derivative expansion, the authors rederive WZW terms in external fields and explore their connection to vorticity as an axial-vector field. They derive induced phenomena like vorticity-driven currents, magnetic field-induced angular momentum, and modified photon-pion couplings under electromagnetic fields at finite chemical potentials. Phenomenological implications are also discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the understanding of WZW terms' roles in chiral dynamics by incorporating vorticity effects through their correspondence with axial-vector fields. This allows the study of emergent phenomena in systems with finite baryon/isospin densities and electromagnetic fields, which are crucial for applications in dense quantum matter and relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Method: The authors use a derivative expansion of the fermion determinant to rederive WZW terms under external vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar fields. They leverage the established mapping where vorticity acts as an axial-vector field coupled to Dirac fermions. By integrating this with electromagnetic interactions at finite chemical potentials, they compute induced vorticity-related terms in the effective action, leading to observable effects.

Result: The study reveals several vorticity-induced effects: a current proportional to vorticity, angular momentum generation from magnetic fields, and altered photon-pion interaction terms due to vorticity. These results provide a framework to analyze chiral anomaly effects in systems with vortical flows and electromagnetic fields, offering insights into transport phenomena in dense matter.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that vorticity can be treated as a surrogate for axial charges/fields in generating dynamical effects on Nambu-Goldstone modes, bridging chiral perturbation theory with hydrodynamic vorticity effects. This approach opens avenues for exploring observable signatures of chiral symmetry breaking and vortical anomalies in experiments like heavy-ion collisions or neutron stars.

Abstract: We study vorticity-induced effects arising from the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms
for Nambu-Goldstone modes in chiral perturbation theory. We first provide an
alternative derivation of the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms in the presence of
external vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar fields using a derivative
expansion of the fermion determinant. We then employ the previously found
correspondence in which vorticity is treated as an axial-vector field coupled
to Dirac fermions in flat spacetime. Using this, we derive vorticity-induced
contributions for Nambu-Goldstone modes in the presence of electromagnetic
fields at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials, including a
vorticity-induced current, a magnetic-field-induced angular momentum, and a
vorticity-modified photon-pion coupling. We also briefly discuss the
phenomenological implications of these vorticity-induced effects.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of a Monte Carlo event generator, integrated with NLO QCD corrections and parton shower algorithms, to model LHC forward neutrino interactions. It applies this tool to analyze FASER data and determine neutrino fluxes using the NNPDF fitting method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the scientific potential of LHC's forward-directed high-energy neutrinos, which have been underutilized. Previous experiments like FASER and SND@LHC have begun measuring these neutrinos, necessitating accurate predictive models for current and future facilities like the FPF.

Method: The energy and rapidity distributions of LHC neutrinos are encoded into a LHAPDF grid, interfaced with the POWHEG-BOX-RES framework for neutrino DIS event generation. The tool incorporates NLO QCD corrections, parton showers, and handles hadronic final states/radiation. It uses fast-interpolation grids and NNPDF fitting to analyze FASER data.

Result: Demonstrates the capability to model differential distributions sensitive to hadronic processes and radiation effects. Successfully applies the method to derive initial LHC forward neutrino flux estimates from FASER data.

Conclusion: The developed framework provides a robust tool for future LHC neutrino experiments. It enables precise predictions and data analysis, opening avenues for studying new physics and cross-validating neutrino interaction models at facilities like the FPF.

Abstract: The LHC generates an intense beam of high-energy neutrinos in the forward
direction, whose scientific potential has been left unexploited for many years.
The FASER and SND@LHC experiments, operating since 2023, have recently measured
LHC neutrinos for the first time. In this contribution we discuss how to
produce accurate predictions, including NLO QCD corrections and modern parton
shower algorithms, for present and future LHC neutrino experiments, including
those at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF). To this end, the energy
and rapidity distribution of the LHC neutrinos is encoded in a LHAPDF grid
interfaced to the neutrino DIS event generator in the POWHEG-BOX-RES framework.
This Monte Carlo tool enables the modelling of differential distributions that
are sensitive to hadronic final states, initial- and final-state radiation, and
realistic acceptance and selection cuts. As a first application, we deploy this
event generator to compute fast-interpolation grids and carry out a first
determination of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes directly from FASER data using
the NNPDF fitting methodology.

*A. Giarnetti,D. Meloni*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is being used to tackle the flavor problem in particle physics by systematically exploring models beyond the Standard Model, rediscovering known solutions and finding new viable ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The flavor problem in particle physics involves understanding fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles, traditionally addressed via models with horizontal symmetries. However, the sheer number of possible models makes manual exploration impractical.

Method: RL algorithms are applied to navigate the complex landscape of extended Standard Model frameworks. These algorithms construct models that align with observed quark and lepton data, automating the search for valid solutions.

Result: RL successfully rediscovers existing theoretical models and identifies novel, phenomenologically acceptable models that satisfy experimental constraints on fermion observables.

Conclusion: RL offers a powerful, automated approach to exploring the high-dimensional parameter space of particle physics models, potentially accelerating discoveries in beyond-Standard-Model physics and highlighting previously unconsidered solutions.

Abstract: This short review discusses recent applications of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) techniques to the flavor problem in particle physics. Traditional
approaches to fermion masses and mixing often rely on extensions of the
Standard Model based on horizontal symmetries, but the vast landscape of
possible models makes systematic exploration infeasible. Recent works have
shown that RL can efficiently navigate this landscape by constructing models
that reproduce observed quark and lepton observables. These approaches
demonstrate that RL not only rediscovers models already proposed in the
literature but also uncovers new, phenomenologically acceptable solutions.

TL;DR: The authors study the Klein-Gordon equation for a charged scalar timelike particle in an electromagnetic plane wave medium with refractive index n<1. They reduce the equation to a Mathieu equation, finding resonant solutions that grow exponentially for small scalar masses. These results are used to constrain millicharged particles and compared against experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how charged particles behave in specific electromagnetic fields and derive limits on millicharged particles, which are hypothetical particles with tiny electric charges, using theoretical predictions from the Klein-Gordon equation analysis.

Method: Reducing the Klein-Gordon equation to the Mathieu equation under the given conditions (timelike particle and refractive index n<1 in medium). Solving the Mathieu equation to identify resonant parameter regimes leading to exponential growth of solutions for small masses.

Result: Resonances occur causing exponential growth of field solutions in certain parameter ranges, particularly noticeable for small scalar masses. These findings provide new theoretical constraints on millicharged particles.

Conclusion: The derived constraints on millicharged particles from their resonance effects are consistent with but complementary to existing experimental data, offering a novel theoretical framework for particle physics research.

Abstract: We investigate the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for a charged scalar
timelike $(k_\mu=(\omega,0,0,n\omega))$ particle in an electromagnetic plane
wave background which can be realized in a medium with a refractive index
$n<1$. We reduce the equation of motion to the Mathieu equation, which has
resonant exponentially growing solutions for certain parameter ranges. We show
that this resonance indeed occurs for small scalar masses. We apply our results
to derive constraints on millicharged particles and compare them with existing
experimental data.

### [51] [Mixed Electroweak-QCD Corrections to $H\to γγ$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25516)
*Wen-Long Sang,Feng Feng,Yu Jia*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents the first calculation of complete three-loop mixed electroweak-QCD corrections for the Higgs boson decay channel H → γγ, considering three on-shell α schemes. The corrections reduce scheme dependence and provide precise predictions for the diphoton partial width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the precision of theoretical predictions for the Higgs boson diphoton decay width, crucial for future Higgs factory experiments, by calculating higher-order mixed electroweak-QCD corrections.

Method: The authors computed three-loop mixed ααs corrections using three different on-shell α schemes (α(0), α(M_Z), Gμ). They analyzed the contributions of O(α), O(αs), and the mixed O(ααs) terms to the decay width.

Result: The mixed three-loop corrections (O(ααs)) contribute 0.2-0.6% depending on the scheme, significantly larger than the three-loop QCD-only corrections (<0.1%). O(α) corrections range from -4.8% to +1.4% across schemes, while O(αs) contributes ~1.7%. The scheme dependence of the partial width decreased from 0.6 keV to 0.03 keV.

Conclusion: The calculations establish updated Standard Model predictions for Γ(H→γγ) as 9.389–9.420 keV, reducing uncertainties and providing a critical benchmark for upcoming Higgs physics experiments at colliders.

Abstract: We present for the first time the complete three-loop mixed electroweak-QCD
($\mathcal{O}(\alpha\alpha_s)$) corrections for the decay channel $H \to
\gamma\gamma$, by implementing three different on-shell $\alpha$ schemes in
computing the electroweak correction. Our studies indicate that the
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ correction amounts to approximately $1.7\%$ of the
leading-order prediction for the diphoton width, while the
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ correction varies from $-4.8\%$ to $1.4\%$ depending on
the specific $\alpha$ scheme. The three-loop mixed electroweak-QCD correction
may reach $0.6\%$, $0.5\%$, and $0.2\%$ of the LO diphoton width in
$\alpha(0)$, $\alpha(M_Z)$, and $G_\mu$ schemes, respectively, which is much
more significant than the less-than-$0.1\%$ contribution from the three-loop
QCD correction. It is also worth noting that the inclusion of the ${\cal
O}(\alpha\alpha_s)$ correction significantly reduces the scheme dependence of
the partial width from $0.6$ keV at leading order down to $0.03$ keV. The
state-of-the-art Standard Model predictions are $\Gamma[H \to \gamma\gamma] =
9.389\div 9.420$ keV, providing a valuable theoretical benchmark for future
Higgs factory collider program.

Abstract: The rich analytic structure of hadronic form factors makes a theoretically
consistent yet easily applicable parametrisation cumbersome. Consequently, most
parametrisations are limited to reproducing the simplest analytic features
sufficient to describe form factors on their first Riemann sheet. Here, we

### [53] [Out-of-equilibrium contributions to charm hadrons in a fluid-dynamic approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25601)
*Rossana Facen,Federica Capellino,Eduardo Grossi,Andrea Dubla,Silvia Masciocchi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper extends a fluid-dynamic framework to include out-of-equilibrium contributions for charm hadrons' distribution functions, allowing computation of yields and transverse momentum distributions dependent on spatial diffusion coefficients, and identifies valid transverse-momentum ranges for the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of describing charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma by accounting for initial out-of-equilibrium conditions and freeze-out effects, enabling systematic determination of charm transport coefficients.

Method: Extended fluid-dynamic framework incorporating corrections from the free-streaming phase's non-equilibrium quark distribution and freeze-out surface effects. Calculations consider variable spatial diffusion coefficients.

Result: Enables exact computation of charm hadron yields and transverse momentum distributions. Identified transverse-momentum regions where the distribution function remains well-defined and positive.

Conclusion: The approach provides a basis for determining charm transport coefficients but is limited to specific transverse-momentum ranges where the distribution function is valid. This framework advances understanding of charm quark dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma.

Abstract: Building on previous studies that demonstrated the applicability of a
fluid-dynamic description of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma, the
present work extends the framework by computing the out-of-equilibrium
contributions to the distribution function of charm hadrons. The analysis
includes corrections arising from the initial out-of-equilibrium distribution
of charm quarks after a free-streaming phase, as well as from the freeze-out
surface within fluid dynamics. These results enable the exact computation of
integrated yields and transverse momentum distributions of charm hadrons for
different values of the spatial diffusion coefficient, thereby providing the
basis for a systematic determination of the charm transport coefficients. In
addition, the limits of applicability of the approach are identified by
determining the transverse-momentum region in which charm hadrons are described
by a well-defined, positive distribution function.

*Oleg Andreev*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a stringy description of a system with two heavy quarks and antiquarks, analyzing their configurations and potentials. It suggests the ground state is a mix of hadronic molecule and tetraquark, with universal string tension properties in multiquark systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure and dynamics of multi-quark systems, particularly the QQ-Q-Q mixture, by applying string theory models to gauge theories.

Method: Analytical and numerical studies of rectangular geometry string configurations, Born-Oppenheimer potentials analysis, and asymptotic energy expressions derivation.

Result: Ground state is a mixed hadronic molecule/tetraquark state; asymptotic energy expressions for tetraquarks in infrared limit; universality of string tension across multiquark systems.

Conclusion: String theory models effectively describe multi-quark interactions, providing insights into tetraquark states and universal properties of confining forces in QCD-like systems.

Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and
two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present
both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for
rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest
Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the
$QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a
tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression
for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend
this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the
universality of the string tension.

### [55] [Muon Beam Dump Experiments explicate five-dimensional nature of $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25613)
*Dibyendu Chakraborty,Arindam Chatterjee,Ayushi Kaushik,Kenji Nishiwaki*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of muon dump experiments to detect 5D U(1)_{Lμ−Lτ} interactions via signals from KK particles in both invisible decay and muon pair channels, emphasizing their complementary roles and the impact of kinetic mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how muon dump experiments can test 5D U(1)_{Lμ−Lτ} models, which predict multi-Kaluza-Klein (KK) gauge bosons. These experiments offer distinct probes (invisible decays vs. muon pairs) to cover diverse parameter spaces and validate extra-dimensional origins.

Method: The study categorizes four experiments (NA64_μ, M³, MuSIC, future beam dump) into two groups: those measuring invisible decays (NA64_μ, M³) and those detecting muon pairs (MuSIC, future). It calculates signal enhancements from KK modes over 4D models and analyzes muon (g−2) constraints to exclude parameter regions affected by kinetic mixing.

Result: Multi-KK states significantly boost signal events vs. 4D scenarios. Muon pair decays permit KK particle mass reconstruction, offering direct evidence of 5D origin. Muon (g−2) data helps exclude certain parameter spaces. Kinetic mixing complicates signals but parameters can be constrained via combined analysis.

Conclusion: Muon dump experiments can provide smoking-gun proof of 5D U(1)_{Lμ−Lτ} via KK particle mass observation in muon pair channels. Complementary cross-experiment coverage and muon (g−2) constraints are critical for verifying extra-dimensionality and constraining kinetic mixing effects.

Abstract: We have investigated the prospects of probing the five-dimensional
$U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ interactions in present and future muon dump
experiments, namely, NA64$_\mu$, M$^3$, MuSIC, and a future muon beam dump
experiment. These experiments are classified into two categories: the first two
can probe processes where feebly interacting massive particles go into
invisible channels, while the latter two can probe processes where these states
decay into muon pairs. These two types of experiments are complementary in that
they allow exploration of different parameter regions of a model. In our
scenario, the presence of multiple massive gauge bosons as Kaluza-Klein (KK)
particles leads to an enhancement in the signal events compared to the
corresponding four-dimensional scenario. In particular, the decay process into
muon pairs enables mass reconstruction of the parent particle, making it
possible to directly demonstrate the existence of multiple KK particles in at
least some parameter regions. This can provide clear evidence that the origin
of the $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ interaction lies in five dimensions.
Furthermore, the muon $(g-2)$ value, which is now consistent with the SM, can
be used to exclude specific parameter regions for new particles interacting
with muons. We also carefully discuss the non-trivial effects arising from
nonzero kinetic mixing.

*J. Barranco,Emiliano Durán*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) affects neutrino oscillations in the presence of a neutrino-dark matter interaction potential, revealing a new resonance at higher energies that could manifest as dips in ultrahigh-energy neutrino fluxes observable in future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of the generalized uncertainty principle on neutrino oscillation resonances when considering interactions between neutrinos and dark matter, potentially providing a testable prediction for future neutrino experiments.

Method: The authors revisited the resonant enhancement scenario in neutrino oscillation probability by incorporating the GUP into the interaction potential between neutrinos and dark matter. They analyzed the modified equations to identify new resonance conditions and their energy dependencies.

Result: The inclusion of GUP introduced a novel resonant conversion mechanism at higher neutrino energies, predicting distinct dips in the ultrahigh-energy neutrino flux that could be detected with future observational data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that GUP effects modify traditional neutrino oscillation resonances, offering a viable experimental signature (flux dips) to probe quantum gravity effects through neutrino-dark matter interactions.

Abstract: We revisited the scenario of a resonant enhancement in the oscillation
probability due to an interaction potential between neutrinos and dark matter
with the novelty of the inclusion of the generalized uncertainty principle. It
is shown that a new resonant conversion appears at higher energies. This effect
could be tested with future neutrino data as new dips in the ultrahigh energy
neutrino flux.

*Kirill Boguslavski,Florian Lindenbauer,Aleksas Mazeliauskas,Adam Takacs,Fabian Zhou*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses weakly coupled QCD kinetic theory to study the thermalization of high-momentum minijets in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), incorporating isotropic hard thermal loop screening. Simulations include collinear radiation and elastic scatterings, showing that standard jet transport coefficients must account for recoiling medium particles' contributions for consistency. The minijet thermalization time scales well with the jet-quenching parameter 𝑞̂, providing a phenomenological estimate for heavy-ion collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address discrepancies between existing jet transport coefficient models and kinetic simulations by incorporating medium particle recoils, ensuring consistency and improving the understanding of minijet thermalization in QGP.

Method: Weakly coupled QCD kinetic theory with isotropic hard thermal loop screening is applied. Kinetic simulations of minijets in a thermal gluon plasma are performed, considering both collinear radiation and elastic scatterings. Results are compared to jet transport coefficients (including 𝑞̂, energy loss, drag coefficient).

Result: Standard jet transport coefficients missed contributions from recoiling medium particles; including them restores consistency with simulations. Thermalization time scales well with 𝑞̂, enabling a phenomenological estimate for quenching time in heavy-ion collisions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the necessity of accounting for recoiling medium particles in jet transport models for accurate thermalization predictions and provides a scalable estimate for minijet quenching times using 𝑞̂, advancing heavy-ion collision phenomenology.

Abstract: We apply weakly coupled QCD kinetic theory to investigate the thermalization
of high-momentum on-shell partons (minijets) in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Our
approach incorporates isotropic hard thermal loop screening to model soft quark
and gluon exchanges, allowing us to verify consistency with established
analytic results of jet transport coefficients. We perform kinetic simulations
of minijets propagating through a thermal gluon plasma, incorporating both
collinear radiation and elastic scatterings. The resulting evolution is
compared to predictions from jet transport coefficients, including the
longitudinal and transverse jet-quenching parameters $\hat{q}$, energy loss,
and the drag coefficient. We find that standard definitions of jet transport
coefficients neglect the contributions from recoiling medium particles.
Including these contributions restores consistency with the kinetic evolution.
Finally, we show that the minijet thermalization time scales remarkably well
with $\hat{q}$ and we produce a phenomenological estimate of the minijet
quenching time in heavy-ion collisions.

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array experiments are rapidly approaching the era of
gravitational wave background anisotropy detection. The timing residuals of
each pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across
all angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars,
current analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the
background at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the
integrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a
previously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map
reconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale
leakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at
scales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into
large-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred
angular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of
scales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry
of the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of
different regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the
quality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of
small-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and
characterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical
formalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this
systematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches.

TL;DR: The Moon's surface offers unique advantages for large optical telescopes and interferometry arrays, surpassing orbital facilities in spatial resolution due to the absence of atmospheric distortion. Recent advancements in lunar lander technology, matured interferometry techniques, and growing operational knowledge make deploying such facilities timely and feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the Moon's environment for high-resolution astrophysics, avoiding Earth's atmospheric limitations and capitalizing on matured lunar access and interferometry technologies.

Method: Analyzes the potential of lunar-based telescope arrays by evaluating technological readiness (lunar landers, interferometry), operational knowledge, and comparative advantages over orbital facilities.

Result: Demonstrates that lunar surface deployment is not only feasible but highly beneficial for achieving unprecedented spatial resolution in astrophysical observations.

Conclusion: The convergence of technological maturity and operational understanding makes the development of lunar optical facilities timely, promising transformative advancements in observational astronomy.

Abstract: The lunar surface is a compelling location for large, distributed optical
facilities, with significant advantages over orbital facilities for high
spatial resolution astrophysics. The serious development of mission concepts is
timely because of the confluence of multiple compelling factors. Lunar access
technology is maturing rapidly, in the form of both US-based crewed and
uncrewed landers, as well as international efforts. Associated with this has
been a definitive maturation of astronomical optical interferometry
technologies at Earth-based facilities over the past three decades, enabling
exquisitely sharp views on the universe previously unattainable, though limited
at present by the Earth's atmosphere. Importantly, the increasing knowledge and
experience base about lunar surface operations indicates it is not just
suitable, but highly attractive for lunar telescope arrays.

Abstract: This paper presents almanac and ephemeris message representation for lunar
navigation satellites supporting the Lunar Augmented Navigation System (LANS).
The proposed method combines osculating orbital elements, Chebyshev
polynomials, and Fourier series to efficiently represent lunar satellite
trajectories subject to complex perturbations from lunar gravity and third-body
effects. For the ephemeris, a hybrid Chebyshev--Fourier formulation improves
fitting accuracy over long arcs while maintaining message compactness under the
data-size constraint of the LunaNet Interoperability Specification. For the
almanac, a compact low-order polynomial and Fourier model is introduced to
capture mid-term orbital variations over a 15-day fitting arc. The approach is
validated for multiple orbit regimes, including 30-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour
elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs) and a 6-hour polar orbit. Results show
that the proposed framework achieves sub-meter position and
sub-millimeter-per-second velocity fitting errors within the 900-bit limit for
6-hour ephemeris arcs, and almanac fitting accuracy sufficient for reliable
satellite-visibility identification in warm-start operations.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the background simulation for the COSI mission, finding that extragalactic photons dominate at low energies and delayed activation dominates at higher energies, with the AP9/AE9 model overestimating flux by 9x compared to CSES-01 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately model background contributions for effective data analysis of the COSI mission, ensuring reliable detection of MeV gamma rays despite significant background challenges.

Method: Monte Carlo simulations of COSI's background over 3 months, extrapolated to 2 years, considering extragalactic photons and cosmic-ray induced activation. Compared HEPD-01 SAA measurements to AP9/AE9 models.

Result: Extragalactic background dominates below 660 keV, cosmic-ray activation dominates above. AP9/AE9 model overestimates flux by 9 times at low latitudes. Quantified systematic uncertainties.

Conclusion: Provides critical background rate estimates for COSI, improving mission planning and data interpretation through refined models and validation with satellite measurements.

Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to
survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip
germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial
low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The
observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from
extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the
detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background
simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work
we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in
orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to
determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We
determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed
as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic
background photons dominate at low energies (<660 keV), while delayed
activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate
at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (<1 deg)
between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector
(HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the
AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor
9 by the model. The systematic uncertainties associated with these components
are quantified. This work marks a major step forward in estimating and
understanding the expected background rates for the COSI satellite mission.
