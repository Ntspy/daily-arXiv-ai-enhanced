By identifying the Fermi LAT gaps and\nthe number of energetic events (fast and wide CMEs, interplanetary type II\nbursts) we conclude that about three times more SGRE events must have occurred\nthan the 15 events observed by Fermi.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the solar cycle variations of sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) events during SCs 24 and 25 using Fermi/LAT data, noting a significant decline in observed SGREs in SC 25 despite similar solar activity levels.

Correcting for observational gaps suggests SC25 had ~45 total SGRE events (vs observed 15), indicating no real decline but consistent activity with SC24.", "conclusion": "The apparent decrease in SGREs is attributed to Fermi's instrumentation limitations rather than solar activity changes. True SGRE rates in SC25 mirror SC24 levels, aligning with other solar activity metrics (SEPs, CMEs). Future observations with full coverage are needed to confirm trends."}}

We\npost-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport\ncode to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the\ncentre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently\npowerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and\naccelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of\nthe engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing\nhigh-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical\nimpact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon\nescape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of\nlow-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially\nhot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic\nsupernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity\nmaterial near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow\nemission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae.
