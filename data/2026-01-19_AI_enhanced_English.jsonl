We investigate the physics of black hole accretion flows, particularly focusing on phenomena like magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation, which are believed to be responsible for energetic events such as flares observed from astrophysical black holes.Aims. We aim to understand the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation within black hole accretion flows that are threaded by multi-loop magnetic field configurations.Methods. We conducted two- and three-dimensional two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. By varying the magnetic loop sizes and the mass accretion rate, we explored how radiative cooling alters the accretion dynamics, disk structure, and the properties of reconnection-driven plasmoid chains.Results. Our results demonstrate that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon. It significantly modifies the disk morphology by lowering the electron temperature and compressing the disk, which leads to increased density at the equatorial plane and decreased magnetization. Within the current sheets, radiative cooling triggers layer compression and the collapse of plasmoids, shortening their lifetime and reducing their size, while the frequency of plasmoid events increases. Moreover, we observe enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere, with its peaks corresponding to plasmoid presence.Conclusions.

We adopt a theoretical approach in which the interaction rate between the energetic jet and medium partons is computed diagrammatically and the hard-thermal-loop resummed propagator is used to regulate the infrared divergence. In the presence of a background field, its influence on the jet quenching parameter manifests in two aspects. One is the modification on the screening mass in the resummed propagator, which leads to an enhanced ${\\hat q}$. The other corresponds to the ${\\cal Q}$-modified parton distribution function which is dominant and leads to a suppression of ${\\hat q}$. Decreasing the temperature $T$, our result shows a non-monotonic $T$-dependence of the dimensionless ${\\hat q}/T^3$. In the high temperature region, ${\\hat q}/T^3$ shows an increase with decreasing $T$ due to the running coupling effect. Near the critical temperature, the background field plays a significant role and a dramatic suppression of ${\\hat q}/T^3$ is found which qualitatively agrees with the Lattice simulation.
