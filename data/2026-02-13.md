### [1] [Improved results of chiral limit study with the large $N_c$ standard U(3) ChPT inputs in the on-shell renormalized quark-meson model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11231)
*Vivek Kumar Tiwari*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study compares two extensions of the relativistic quark-meson (RQM) model incorporating different chiral perturbation theory approaches. The RQM-S model using large Nc standard U(3) ChPT shows stable chiral limit behavior with saturation of tricritical lines, whereas the RQM-I model with infrared regularized ChPT exhibits divergent behavior at higher sigma meson masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the suitability of different chiral perturbation theory scaling relations for modeling chiral symmetry breaking in 2+1 flavor quark-meson models near the chiral limit.

Method: Compared parameters of RQM-S (using large Nc standard U(3) ChPT) and RQM-I (infrared regularized U(3) ChPT) models. Constructed Columbia plots for sigma meson masses 400, 500, 600 MeV to analyze tricritical line behavior in meson mass planes.

Result: RQM-S model demonstrates stable tricritical lines that flatten and saturate in the meson mass plane across all sigma masses. Conversely, RQM-I shows increasing divergence particularly at 600 MeV sigma mass.

Conclusion: The RQM-S framework with large Nc standard ChPT provides a more robust platform for chiral extrapolations, as its behavior aligns better with expected saturation patterns in the chiral limit.

Abstract: When the $f_π, f_{K} \text{ and } M_η^2$ given by the $ (m_π,m_{K}) $ dependent scaling relations of the large $N_{c}$ standard U(3) Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and the infrared regularized U(3) ChPT,~are used in the on-shell renormalized 2+1 flavor quark-meson (RQM) model to find its parameters in the path to the chiral limit $(m_π,m_{K}) \rightarrow 0$ away from the physical point $ (m_π^{\text{\tiny{Phys}}},m_{K}^{\text{\tiny{Phys}}})=(138,496) $ MeV,~one gets the respective framework of RQM-S model and RQM-I model.~Computing and comprehensively comparing the RQM-S and I model Columbia plots for the $m_σ=400,500\text{ and }600$ MeV,~it has been shown that the use of large $N_c$ standard U(3) ChPT inputs give the better and improved framework for the Chiral limit studies as the RQM-S model tricritical lines show the expected saturation pattern after becoming flat in the vertical meson (quark) mass $μ-m_{K}$ ($μ-m_{s}$) plane for all the cases of $m_σ$ whereas the divergent RQM-I model tricritical line for the $m_σ=500$ MeV becomes strongly divergent when the $m_σ=600$ MeV.

### [2] [Pion $β$ decay and $τ\toππν_τ$ beyond leading logarithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11253)
*Vincenzo Cirigliano,Martin Hoferichter,Nicola Valori*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper improves precision predictions for weak hadronic processes by refining the matching of short-distance contributions and hadronic matrix elements, focusing on charged-current processes involving two pions. It reduces theoretical uncertainties in pion β decay rates and τ→ππντ isospin-breaking corrections using lattice QCD, essential for future V_{ud} and hadronic vacuum polarization studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve precise predictions for weak processes involving hadrons by addressing the consistent matching of short-distance contributions and hadronic matrix elements, crucial for reducing theory uncertainties in pion β decay and τ decays, which are key to determining fundamental parameters like V_{ud} and the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon's g-2.

Method: The authors use recent lattice QCD results to formulate matching beyond leading-logarithmic accuracy, specifically eliminating scheme dependence from evanescent operators. This method systematically improves the precision of decay rate calculations by canceling out theoretical uncertainties.

Result: The main results are a threefold reduction in theory uncertainties for pion β decay rates, making them negligible even beyond the PIONEER experiment's reach, and nearly uncertainty-free short-distance matching for isospin-breaking corrections in τ→ππντ decays.

Conclusion: The improved precision enables future high-accuracy determinations of V_{ud} through pion β decay and accurate τ-based evaluations of hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, advancing subatomic physics measurements.

Abstract: The consistent matching of short-distance contributions and hadronic matrix elements is crucial for precise predictions of weak processes involving hadrons. In this Letter, we address this point for charged-current processes involving two pions -- pion $β$ decay $π^\pm\toπ^0 e^\pmν_e$ and hadronic $τ$ decays $τ^\pm\toπ^\pmπ^0ν_τ$ -- whose decay rates depend on the so-called $γW$ box correction. Using recent results from lattice QCD, we show how to formulate the matching beyond leading-logarithmic accuracy, in particular, how to cancel the dependence on the scheme choice for evanescent operators. As main results, we obtain a prediction for the decay rate of pion $β$ decay with theory uncertainties improved by a factor of three, which renders theory uncertainties negligible for future determinations of $V_{ud}$ even beyond the reach of the PIONEER experiment, and an evaluation of isospin-breaking corrections to $τ\toππν_τ$ with negligible uncertainty from the short-distance matching, as necessary for a future $τ$-based determination of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.

### [3] [The X17 with Chiral Couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11263)
*Max H. Fieg,Toni Mäkelä,Tim M. P. Tait,Miša Toman*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores whether a new spin-1 particle X17 with chiral couplings can explain anomalies observed by the ATOMKI collaboration in electron-positron pair production, but finds tension with other experimental constraints due to the large excess in carbon-12 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if the ATOMKI and PADME experimental anomalies can be explained by a spin-1 particle with both vector and axial-vector couplings, addressing the discrepancies in previous studies that considered only one coupling type.

Method: The authors analyze the parameter space of an X particle with chiral couplings to quarks, considering compatibility with ATOMKI's electron-positron excess and experimental constraints (e.g., atomic parity violation, electron beam searches).

Result: The X17 model can partially explain the ATOMKI anomalies, but the 99% confidence region conflicts with null results from other experiments, primarily due to the large excess observed in the carbon-12 transition.

Conclusion: While chiral couplings to quarks provide a viable framework for X17, the required coupling strength conflicts with existing experimental limits, suggesting either the anomalies may not be new physics or additional model modifications are needed.

Abstract: In recent years, the ATOMKI collaboration has performed a series of measurements of excited nuclei, observing a resonant excess of electron-positron pairs at large opening angles compared to the Standard Model prediction. The excess has been hypothesized to be due to the production of a new spin-1 or spin-0 particle, X17, with a mass of about 17 MeV. Recently, the PADME experiment has reported an excess in the $e^+e^-$ cross section at center-of-mass energies near 17 MeV, perhaps further hinting at the existence of a new state. Studies of the spin-1 case have hitherto focused on either vector {\em or} axial-vector couplings to quarks and leptons, whereas UV theories more naturally produce {\em both} vector and axial-vector (\textit{i.e.} chiral) couplings, analogous to the Standard Model weak interactions. We consider the ATOMKI anomalies in the context of an $X$ with chiral couplings to quarks and explore the parameter space that can explain the ATOMKI anomalies, contrasting them with experimental constraints. We find that it is possible to accommodate the reported ATOMKI signals. However, the $99\%$ CL region is in tension with null results from searches for atomic parity violation and direct searches for new low mass physics coupled to electrons. This tension is found to be driven by the magnitude of the reported excess in the transition of $^{12}{\rm C}(17.23)$, which drives the best-fit region towards excluded couplings.

### [4] [Thermal precondensation in gauge-fermion theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11265)
*Álvaro Pastor-Gutiérrez,Jan M. Pawlowski,Franz R. Sattler*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Precondensation in gauge-fermion theories near the thermal chiral phase transition is analyzed, showing its prevalence and temperature range increase with more fermion flavours, and its relevance across fermionic systems including beyond Standard Model physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand precondensation's role in phase transitions and its connection to domains, pseudo-gapped phases, and inhomogeneities, exploring its appearance in gauge-fermion theories in the chiral limit.

Method: Analyzing precondensation dynamics in gauge-fermion theories near thermal chiral transitions, examining how flavour number affects its extension and temperature range. The study's scope includes applications from condensed matter to high-energy physics.

Result: Precondensation becomes more pronounced and spans wider temperature ranges as fermion flavours increase. The dynamics observed apply to a broad class of fermionic systems.

Conclusion: Precondensation's universal dynamics suggest its importance in understanding phase transitions across disciplines, potentially guiding investigations into physics beyond the Standard Model.

Abstract: Precondensation is a peculiar phenomenon in phase transitions, characterised by the occurrence of a condensate only over a finite range of length scales. It is closely connected to the emergence of domains, pseudo-gapped phases and spatial inhomogeneities in equilibrium. In this work, we show its occurrence in gauge-fermion theories in the chiral limit, close to the thermal chiral phase transition. We further show that the precondensation regime becomes increasingly pronounced and extends over a wider temperature range as the number of fermion flavours is increased. We analyse the underlying dynamics which is shared by a broad class of fermionic systems, ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics. Specifically, we discuss the potential relevance of this phenomenon for physics beyond the Standard Model.

### [5] [Fate of $θ_{12}$ under $μ-τ$ Reflection Symmetry in Light of the First JUNO Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11277)
*Ranjeet Kumar*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a model based on $A_4$ flavor symmetry within a type-II seesaw framework that naturally incorporates $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry. It predicts $θ_{23}=45^{°}$ and $δ_{CP}=\pm π/2$, but one scenario for $θ_{12}$ is ruled out by JUNO data. Future neutrino experiments will test remaining predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The recent JUNO measurements of $θ_{12}$ and $Δm^2_{21}$ provide a new opportunity to explore flavor symmetries in the lepton sector. The authors aim to investigate how $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry can emerge from an $A_4$ flavor symmetry framework, leading to testable predictions.

Method: A model is constructed using $A_4$ flavor symmetry combined with a type-II seesaw mechanism. The authors analyze the implications of this symmetry on lepton mixing parameters, focusing on $θ_{23}$, $δ_{CP}$, and $θ_{12}$. They consider two scenarios for $θ_{12}$ and examine parameter correlations.

Result: The model predicts $θ_{23}=45^{°}$ and $δ_{CP}=\pm π/2$. One scenario predicts $σin^2θ_{12} ≥ 0.335$, which is inconsistent with JUNO results. However, correlations between $θ_{12}$ and model parameters offer predictive power. Future experiments like DUNE and T2HK will further test the remaining viable scenario.

Conclusion: The model provides a theoretically consistent framework for $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry within $A_4$ symmetry. While部分 predictions conflict with current data, both existing and upcoming experiments can validate its remaining predictions.

Abstract: The recent JUNO measurements of $θ_{12}$ and $Δm^2_{21}$ open a new avenue for probing flavor symmetric structures in the lepton sector. Motivated by this, we study a model in which $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry naturally emerges from an underlying $A_4$ flavor symmetry within a type-II seesaw framework. Beyond its standard predictions of $θ_{23}=45^{\circ}$ and $δ_{\rm CP}=\pm π/2$, the framework yields testable predictions for $θ_{12}$ that can be probed by JUNO. Two viable scenarios arise, one predicting $\sin^2θ_{12} \gsim 0.335$, which is strongly disfavored by the latest JUNO results. Correlations between $θ_{12}$ and model parameters further enhance the model's predictivity. Future measurements at DUNE and T2HK will provide complementary tests of this scenario.

### [6] [Constraints on dark axion portal: missing energy and fermion EDMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11405)
*Sergei N. Gninenko,N. V. Krasnikov,Valery E. Lyubovitskij,Sergey Kuleshov,Alexey S. Zhevlakov,I. V. Voronchikhin,D. V. Kirpichnikov*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a dark axion portal model extending the Standard Model by including interactions between photons, dark photons, and axion-like particles. It analyzes missing energy signatures in electron fixed-target experiments like NA64e and LDMX, deriving constraints on dark sector parameters using experimental data including electric dipole moment measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility of detecting dark sector particles through observable missing energy in fixed-target experiments and to constrain CP-violating couplings using EDM measurements, addressing gaps in experimental verification of dark photon and ALP models.

Method: The study uses two production mechanisms— bremsstrahlung-like emission of a dark photon/ALP pair and vector meson photoproduction followed by invisible decays. Sensitivity curves for NA64e and LDMX are projected, with constraints derived from EDM limits via loop-induced contributions.

Result: New constraints on dark photon/ALP parameters from NA64e data with $9.37×10^{11}$ electrons are established. The analysis shows improved sensitivity over previous bounds, particularly in regions where dark photons decay to invisible fermion pairs, and provides EDM-based limits on CP-violating couplings.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that electron fixed-target experiments like NA64e are powerful tools for probing dark sector physics, extending constraints on beyond-Standard-Model scenarios. Future high-luminosity runs could further explore untested parameter spaces and validate theoretical predictions.

Abstract: We study a model in which a new interactions between the Standard Model (SM) photon and both the dark photon ($γ_D)$ and an ALP ($a$) are described by the dark axion portal operator. The implications of this dark axion portal scenario for electron fixed-target experiments are presented. In particular, we investigate the missing energy signatures associated with production of dark photons and their subsequent invisible decays into stable dark sector fermions, $γ_D \to χ\barχ$. We discuss the discovery potential for such a scenario and derive projected sensitivity curves for the NA64$e$ and LDMX experiments. Furthermore, novel constraints of the NA64$e$ for $9.37\times 10^{11}$ electrons on target are derived by considering two production mechanisms for invisible states: (i)~the bremsstrahlung-like emission of an $aγ_D$ pair, $e N \to e N γ^* (\to a γ_D)$, and (ii)~the exclusive vector meson photoproduction, $γ^* N \to N V$, followed by the invisible decays of vector mesons, $V \to a γ_D$. Additionally, the constraints on the parameter space of $CP$-violating, fermion-specific ALP and dark photon couplings are established. These constraints are derived from current experimental bounds on the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of SM fermions, incorporating loop-induced contributions to the EDMs of the electron, muon, and neutron.

### [7] [A study of charged-particle multiplicity distribution in high energy p-O collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11452)
*Yuri N. Lima,Lucas J. F. Silva,Andre V. Giannini,Marcelo G. Munhoz*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study compares Pythia (Angantyr) and k_T-factorization approaches to analyze charged particle multiplicity distributions in p-O collisions, using α-cluster and Woods-Saxon models. Differences in geometric descriptions impact multiplicities, especially at high values and large pseudorapidity. Results show distinct behaviors between the two formalisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how initial oxygen nucleus configurations affect final-state charged particle multiplicities and evaluate the performance of Pythia vs k_T-factorization in modeling these processes.

Method: Employed Pythia (Angantyr) and k_T-factorization formalisms with α-cluster model for oxygen nuclei. Compared results against Woods-Saxon distribution. Analyzed multiplicities across pseudorapidity intervals |η| < 0.5-3.0 and energies √s = 2.36-13 TeV. Applied KNO scaling analysis and double NBD parameterization.

Result: Geometric models caused significant multiplicity differences, notably at large multiplicities and higher |η|. Pythia-derived multiplicities showed distinct behavior from k_T-factorization. The analysis highlighted contributions from both soft and semi-hard processes.

Conclusion: The choice of nuclear geometry model and collision formalism (Pythia vs k_T-factorization) critically affects charged particle multiplicity predictions. Results emphasize the need for accurate nuclear structure modeling in high-energy physics simulations.

Abstract: This study investigates the multiplicity distribution of charged particles generated in $p$-O collisions, employing Pythia (Angantyr) and $k_T$-factorization approach. Oxygen nucleus configurations are sampled using a $α$-cluster model to evaluate both formalisms and assess how initial nucleus configuration influences the properties of the produced final states. Results obtained through clustering are systematically compared to those derived from the Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution. The analysis encompasses various pseudorapidity intervals ($|η|<$ 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0) and center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s}=$ 2.36, 5.02, 7.0, 13.0 TeV). Based on the resulting distributions, we examine the KNO scaling effect and fit the distributions with the double NBD model for parameterization, aiming to accurately characterize the observed results and elucidate contributions from both soft and semi-hard processes. Our results indicate that different geometric descriptions of the oxygen nucleus project significantly different multiplicities of charged particles, especially for large multiplicities and higher pseudorapidity. We also observed that multiplicity of charged particles calculated with Pythia reveals significantly different behavior from that calculated with $k_T$-factorization.

### [8] [The absence of global anomalies of CP symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11475)
*Kazuya Yonekura*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates anomalies of CP symmetry in theories where CP is gauged, finding no new anomalies when coupled to gravity and gauge fields with a simply connected gauge group like the Standard Model's.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the validity of solutions to the strong CP problem that rely on CP as a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry, it's crucial to confirm the absence of global anomalies in such scenarios.

Method: The authors analyze the anomalies of CP symmetry for fermions interacting with gravity and gauge fields of group G, focusing on cases where G is connected and simply connected.

Result: Gauging CP symmetry doesn't introduce new anomalies beyond existing ones when G is simply connected. Specifically, the Standard Model matter content remains free of such anomalies.

Conclusion: The absence of additional anomalies supports the feasibility of CP-as-gauge-symmetry approaches to solving the strong CP problem within the Standard Model framework.

Abstract: Some solutions to the strong CP problem assume that CP symmetry is a gauge symmetry, which is then spontaneously broken. For this scenario to be possible, the CP symmetry should not have any nonperturbative (global) anomalies. In this paper, we study anomalies of CP symmetry of fermions which are coupled to gravity and gauge fields with a gauge group $G$. When $G$ is connected and simply connected, we show that gauging a CP symmetry does not produce any new anomaly beyond the one before gauging it. In particular, the standard model matter content does not have anomalies.

### [9] [Triple Differential Heavy-to-light Semi-leptonic Decays at Next-to-Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order in QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11537)
*Long Chen,Xiang Chen,Xin Guan,Yan-Qing Ma*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents the first complete N³LO (NNNLO) calculation of five heavy-to-light hadronic structure functions in semi-leptonic heavy-quark decays using a novel hybrid computational method. This advance improves precision predictions for decay rates and addresses key flavor-physics observables, including $|V_{ub}|$, $|V_{cs}|$, and $|V_{cd}|$ determinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve higher precision in theoretical predictions for semi-leptonic heavy-quark decays, enabling better utilization of experimental data from Belle II, BES III, and LHCb. This addresses the need for reducing uncertainties in CKM matrix element determinations and resolving discrepancies between inclusive/exclusive $|V_{ub}|$ measurements.

Method: An innovative hybrid computational strategy was developed to perform next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$) calculations for five hadronic structure functions. This method combines analytical and numerical techniques to handle the computational complexity of N³LO contributions.

Result: The work provides precise triple-differential decay rate predictions, including an improved estimation of the $B \to X_u \ell \nu$ width for percent-level $|V_{ub}|$ determination and first $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ results for lepton-energy moments in charm decays. Significant higher-order corrections were found in the large-$q^2$ region of $b \to u$ transitions.

Conclusion: The N³LO calculations mark a major step toward high-precision flavor physics analysis, resolving theoretical uncertainties and informing ongoing experimental efforts. The identified large higher-order effects suggest the need for refined theoretical interpretations of inclusive $|V_{ub}|$ measurements to reconcile with exclusive determinations.

Abstract: We report the first complete calculation of the five heavy-to-light hadronic structure functions underlying semi-leptonic heavy-quark decays at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$) in perturbative QCD. This theoretical advance, achieved via an innovative hybrid computational strategy, enables precision predictions for triple differential decay rates. The results are essential for harnessing the potential of high-precision experiments at Belle II, BES III, and LHCb. Selected applications of this work include a state-of-the-art prediction for the inclusive $B \to X_u \ell ν$ width, crucial for a percent-level determination of $|V_{ub}|$, and the first $\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$ results for lepton-energy moments in charm decays, vital for extracting $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cd}|$. Our analysis also reveals significant higher-order corrections in the large-$q^2$ region of $b \to u$ transitions, offering new insights into the persistent tension between inclusive and exclusive $|V_{ub}|$ determinations.

### [10] [Multi-Particle Invariant Mass -- Standard Expressions and Corrections to Order $(m/E)^4$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11556)
*M. P. Fewell*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the invariant mass calculations in collider physics, exploring corrections to the standard formula when particle energies are not vastly larger than their masses. It finds the assumptions behind the simplified formulas are robust despite higher-order terms, and extends the method to multi-particle systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously test the validity of the standard invariant mass approximation in high-energy physics by quantifying correction terms when particle energies are comparable to masses, ensuring accurate analysis of particle collisions.

Method: Derives correction terms up to (m/E)^4 for two-particle invariant mass expressions, calculates similar terms for three- and four-particle systems, and identifies cancellation effects that suppress higher-order contributions. Uses perturbative expansion in powers of m/E.

Result: Leading corrections are quadratic but suppressed by coefficient cancellations; quartic terms are further reduced. Multi-particle zeroth-order expressions are surprisingly simple, suggesting broader applicability of simplified formulas.

Conclusion: The standard invariant mass approximation remains highly accurate even when mass-energy ratios are moderate. Generalizable correction frameworks allow precise calculations for systems with more particles.

Abstract: In collider-based particle physics, $invariant\ mass$ refers to the magnitude of the total-momentum 4-vector of a system of particles. An expression for the invariant mass of a 2-particle system is well known; it assumes that both the total energy $E$ and the transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}$ of each particle in the system greatly exceed its mass $m$. This note explores these assumptions by computing correction terms in powers of $m/E$ up to order $(m/E)^4$. The assumptions are found to be robust: not only is the leading correction quadratic in $m/E$, but also cancellations reduce its coefficient and that of the next-to-leading correction, which is of order $(m/E)^4$. Three- and four-particle systems are also treated and the generalisation to larger numbers of particles indicated. The zeroth-order expressions for these multi-particle systems are remarkably simple; they deserve to be better known.

*Taramati,Manas Kumar Mohapatra,Utkarsh Patel,Rukmani Mohanta,Sudhanwa Patra*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an extended Standard Model with a U(1)_B symmetry where a baryon-charged scalar mediates interactions between dark matter and quarks. This setup allows for coannihilation processes that influence dark matter abundance and connects dark sector physics with flavor observables. Parameter space analysis shows viability in upcoming experiments like XENONnT and CTA, along with implications for b→s μ⁺μ⁻ transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of minimal U(1)_B models by introducing a scalar mediator that enables coannihilation, unifies dark matter and flavor physics, and survives existing constraints while offering testable predictions.

Method: Detailed study of the U(1)_B extended model focusing on scalar-mediated interactions, coannihilation effects dependent on mass splitting, and parameter space analysis against cosmological, direct/indirect detection, and LHC data.

Result: Identified viable parameter regions beyond minimal models, accessible to future experiments. Predicted correlated flavor signatures in b→s μ⁺μ⁻ transitions as additional validation tests.

Conclusion: The extended scalar-U(1)_B framework provides a promising beyond-Standard-Model scenario with testable predictions at upcoming dark matter and collider experiments, reinforcing the connection between dark matter and flavor physics.

Abstract: We explore a Standard Model extension based on a local $U(1)_B$ symmetry, where a baryon-charged scalar mediates interactions between a fermionic dark matter candidate and Standard Model quarks. In this setup, the dark matter relic abundance is shaped not only by standard annihilation channels but also by additional coannihilation processes induced by a new scalar. The presence of this mediator provides a unified link between dark sector and flavor physics, yielding distinctive phenomenological consequences. We conduct a detailed study of dark matter phenomenology, emphasizing the role of the mass splitting between the dark matter particles, and the scalar mediator in determining the efficiency of coannihilation. The parameter space is examined in light of existing constraints from cosmological observations, direct and indirect detection experiments, as well as the collider searches at the \texttt{LHC}. Our analysis shows that the extended scalar sector opens up viable regions of parameter space beyond those accessible in minimal \(U(1)_B\) realizations, many of which are expected to be tested by forthcoming searches at \texttt{XENONnT} and \texttt{CTA}. Moreover, the model induces correlated signatures from flavor observables associated with the $b \to s μ^+ μ^-$ transitions as well, serving as complementary tests of the underlying framework.

### [12] [Generalizing the Soffer Bound: Positivity Constraints on Parton Distributions of Spin-3/2 Particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11587)
*Dongyan Fu,Yubing Dong,S. Kumano,Ju-Jun Xie*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper derives the first complete set of positivity bounds for leading-twist parton distribution functions (PDFs) of spin-3/2 hadrons, extending the Soffer bound to higher-spin systems. It connects PDFs with scattering amplitudes via the spin density matrix and helicity amplitudes, establishing constraints on their parameter space through matrix positivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize fundamental positivity constraints (originally for spin-1/2 nucleons like the Soffer bound) to higher-spin particles, ensuring physically valid PDFs and scattering amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics.

Method: Expressed antiparton-hadron scattering amplitudes using PDFs and spin density matrix elements, mapped connections in tensor product spin space, derived PDF definitions via helicity amplitudes, and applied positivity conditions on scattering matrices to formulate inequalities constraining PDFs.

Result: Established new positivity bounds for spin-3/2 hadron PDFs, defined PDFs through helicity amplitudes, and determined physically allowed regions in helicity amplitude/PDF parameter space via derived inequalities.

Conclusion: These results extend foundational QCD constraints to higher-spin systems, providing essential bounds for theoretical calculations and experimental validations of parton distributions in exotic hadrons.

Abstract: We derive the complete set of positivity bounds for the leading-twist parton distribution functions (PDFs) of a spin-3/2 hadron for the first time. This work generalizes the Soffer bound, a fundamental constraint for spin-1/2 nucleons, to quark and gluon distribution functions in higher-spin systems. Expressing the antiparton-hadron scattering amplitudes in terms of the PDFs and the spin density matrix, we establish the connections between the PDFs and the scattering amplitudes in the tensor product space of the parton and hadron spins. Moreover, we obtain the definitions of the PDFs in terms of the helicity amplitudes. Positive definiteness of the scattering amplitude matrix yields a set of inequalities that define the physically allowed parameter space for the helicity amplitudes and a set of constraints for the PDFs.

*Xiao-Peng Wang,Yi-Jie Li,Guang-Zhi Xu,Kui-Yong Liu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines charmonia+bottomonia associated production using NRQCD, highlighting dominant CO contributions and the impact of relativistic corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the production mechanisms and constraints on CO matrix elements through upcoming experiments at super $Z$ factories and CEPC/FCC-ee.

Method: NRQCD framework including both CS and CO channels, calculating relativistic corrections and cross-section predictions.

Result: CO states dominate cross sections across all energy ranges; relativistic corrections reduce cross sections by ~50% ($K$ factor ≈0.5); predicted event counts are (1,1) and (13,10) for specific decay channels.

Conclusion: Future experimental data can constrain CO matrix elements; relativistic corrections are critical for accurate predictions.

Abstract: Within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework, we investigate the associated production of charmonia+bottomonia at future super $Z$ factory and at the CEPC/FCC-ee. The color-octet(CO) channels in the $γ^*/Z^0$-propagated process are considered besides the color-singlet(CS) channels. We find that the contributions of the CO states to the total cross section are dominant for almost all processes from the production threshold to the $Z^0$ mass. Thus, the comparison between the theoretical results and future data may give constraints to the CO matrix elements. In addition, we calculate the relativistic corrections to both the CS and CO channels, which decrease the cross sections significantly, with the $K$ factor $\simeq0.5$. The predicted events of ($J/ψ+Υ$, $Υ+η_c$) production, with $J/ψ, Υ$ reconstructed by lepton pair and $η_c$ reconstructed by hadronic decays, are (1,1) and (13,10) at the CEPC(2-yr) and FCC-ee(4-yr), respectively.

TL;DR: The paper constructs a hybrid equation of state (EoS) to study QCD matter in magnetic fields and chemical potentials, finding significant effects on thermodynamic quantities and showing partial agreement with lattice QCD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how finite magnetic fields and nonzero chemical potentials impact thermodynamic properties of QCD matter, especially near phase transitions.

Method: A hybrid EoS is created by interpolating hadron resonance gas (low temperatures) and ideal parton gas (high temperatures). Dimensionsless observables and squared speed of sound are analyzed under varying conditions.

Result: Key observables shift with chemical potential and magnetic fields: they rise with increasing μ, while B suppresses at low T but enhances at high T. c_s² shows critical behavior near phase transition temperatures. Agreement with lattice data is good except at high field strengths.

Conclusion: The hybrid EoS framework is valuable for studying QCD matter under extreme conditions, but improvements are needed for stronger magnetic fields.

Abstract: We construct a hybrid equation of state (EoS) by smoothly interpolating the EoS in the hadron resonance gas at low temperatures to that in the ideal parton gas at high temperatures, and employ it to study the properties of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter at a finite magnetic field and nonzero chemical potential. We find that dimensionless observables such as the entropy density $s/T^3$, the pressure $P/T^4$, the energy density $\varepsilon/T^4$, the trace anomaly $Δ= (\varepsilon - 3P)/T^4$, and the specific heat at constant volume $C_V/T^3$ are sensitive to both finite magnetic field and chemical potential. As the chemical potential increases from zero, these quantities rise in both the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. In contrast, introducing a magnetic field suppresses them at low temperatures but enhances them at high temperatures. Furthermore, nonzero chemical potential and magnetic field introduce nontrivial modifications to the squared speed of sound $c_s^2$. Both effects increase $c_s^2$ close to the critical temperature while reducing it at lower temperatures. When the chemical potential and magnetic field are present simultaneously, their influences superimpose, leading to more intricate changes in the thermodynamic behavior. Finally, we compare our results with the lattice QCD data for the quadratic fluctuations of conserved charges and their correlations. The model successfully reproduces the temperature dependence of these observables at $eB=0$ and 0.04 GeV$^2$. However, at the stronger field strength $eB=0.14$ GeV$^2$, the model underestimates the magnitudes while still capturing the overall temperature trend.

*Zhi-Yuan Chen,Zhe-Hao Cao,You-You Lin,Ji-Ying Wang,Ailin Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper studies open-charm tetraquarks using a quark model, identifying observed states as excited configurations and predicting additional states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To interpret recent tetraquark candidates T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)++ and 0 states and explore their structural differences.

Method: Nonrelativistic constituent quark potential model treating tetraquarks as diquark-antidiquark bound systems with interactions akin to conventional mesons.

Result: Identifies existing D_{s0}*(2317) and D_{s1}(2460) as ground states, predicts a 2500 MeV 0+ state and a 2640-2700 MeV 2+ state, suggests tetraquark mass differences arise from structure rather than isospin breaking.

Conclusion: Proposes further experimental validation needed for isospin assignment and existence of predicted states.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of exotic open-charm tetraquark candidates \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\) and \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{0}\), we systematically calculate the mass spectra of \([cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]\) tetraquarks within a nonrelativistic constituent quark potential model. In the model, the tetraquark states are treated as diquark-antidiquark bound systems with an interior interaction similar to the quark-antiquark interaction in conventional mesons. The well established states \(D_{s0}^*(2317)\) with \(J^P=0^+\) and \(D_{s1}(2460)\) with \(J^P=1^+\) could be identified as the two ground states of the \([cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]\) system. \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{0}\) and \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\) could be naturally interpreted as radially excited \(0^+\) tetraquark states with different interior components. Their large mass difference may result from their different interior structure instead of an isospin symmetry breaking. Whether \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{0}\) and \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\) belong to an isospin triplet deserves further experimental investigation. In addition, there may be another \(0^+\) \([cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]\) tetraquark state with mass around $2450$ MeV, which is composed of a $cq$ diquark and a $\bar s\bar q$ antidiquark both with spin-0. In the energy region $2640-2700$ MeV, there may be a $J^P=2^+$ \([cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]\) tetraquark state composed of the $cq$ diquark and the $\bar s\bar q$ antidiquark both with spin-1.

*Yu Hamada,Muneto Nitta,Zebin Qiu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the phase diagram of low-energy QCD under a magnetic field at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials using chiral perturbation theory. It identifies phases like vacuum, chiral soliton lattice (CSL), pion condensations, vortex lattices (Abrikosov and baryonic), and hybrid phases, emphasizing the baryonic vortex lattice's role in realistic neutron star magnetic fields (~10¹⁷ G).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how magnetic fields influence QCD phases at extreme conditions relevant to neutron stars, focusing on phases carrying baryon numbers through topological structures.

Method: Leading-order chiral perturbation theory applied to QCD in magnetic fields, analyzing phase transitions and stable configurations under varying baryon/isospin chemical potentials.

Result: Phase diagram shows multiple phases differentiated by magnetic field strength and chemical potentials, notably the baryonic vortex lattice and hybrid phase appearing at ~10¹⁷ G, which is plausible in neutron stars.

Conclusion: Magnetic fields significantly alter QCD phase behavior; the identified phases, especially those at ~10¹⁷ G, offer insights into neutron star interiors and the interplay between baryonic matter and topology.

Abstract: Based on the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, we present the phase diagram of low-energy QCD in a magnetic field at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. The phase diagram consists of the QCD vacuum, the chiral soliton lattice, the uniform charged pion condensation, an Abrikosov vortex lattice of the charged pions, a baryonic vortex lattice composed of neutral and charged pion vortices with their topological linking number being the baryon number, and a hybrid phase of chiral soliton and vortex lattices, with their intersections carrying the baryon number. While the chiral soliton lattice demands ultra-strong magnetic field $\sim 10^{19}$ G,the intersection phase appears at $\sim10^{17}$ G, which is more realistic in neutron stars.

*Long Chen,Xiang Chen,Xin Guan,Yan-Qing Ma*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents the first complete O(α_s^2) and O(α_s^3) perturbative QCD corrections to heavy-to-light semi-leptonic decay structure functions using a hybrid computational strategy. Key results include precise predictions for B → X_u ℓν decay rates and insights into QCD correction convergence and mass scheme transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve theoretical precision in calculating heavy quark decay rates, refine CKM elements determinations, and explore the impact of high-order QCD corrections on non-perturbative parameters. Also aims to resolve boundary effects in mass scheme conversions.

Method: Hybrid computational method combining stratified Gauss-Kronrod integration with linear interpolation based on a function basis, reducing numerical ε-dependence. Applied to differential equations in variables other than q², and handled mass scheme transitions through perturbative reformulation.

Result: Achieved a state-of-the-art prediction for Γ(B → X_u ℓν), observed improved convergence of QCD corrections across mass schemes, identified novel boundary terms at O(α_s^3) in pole-to-other mass scheme conversions affecting integrated moments.

Conclusion: The derived corrections significantly enhance precision in inclusive CKM measurements and non-perturbative parameter estimations. The uncovered boundary terms redefine perturbative treatment requirements, necessitating histogramming from O(α_s^3) onward. These advancements are critical for next-generation precision analyses in B-physics.

Abstract: We present the first complete $\mathcal{O}(α_s^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$ perturbative QCD corrections to all five heavy-to-light structure functions underlying the triple-differential semi-leptonic decay rates of heavy quarks. This is achieved via a hybrid computational strategy that combines an efficient linear interpolation (with a suitable function basis) based on stratified Gauss-Kronrod points in the leptonic-mass $q^2$ with the differential equations in the other variable, further armed with reduced numerical $\varepsilon$-dependence. Among the selected applications, we highlight the state-of-the-art prediction $Γ(B \rightarrow X_u \ell \barν_{\ell}) = \frac{|V_{ub}|^2}{|3.82\times 10^{-3}|^2}\,\big( 6.53 \,\pm 0.12 \, \pm 0.13\, \pm 0.03\, \big) \times 10^{-16}\,\text{GeV}\,$ derived in the kinetic-mass scheme. We report several notable observations regarding the convergence of the first three orders of QCD corrections to the $q^2$-spectrum and to inclusive moments of the lepton-energy spectrum in semi-leptonic weak decays of $b$- and $c$-quark in different quark-mass schemes; they are important both for improving the inclusive determinations of the relevant CKM elements, non-perturbative dynamical parameters, and for gaining new insights into the potential impact of high-order QCD corrections. Lastly we discuss a novel interesting point encountered in the consistent perturbative reformulation of the differential $q^2$-spectrum from the pole-mass to other mass schemes: certain boundary-effect terms are identified that are non-vanishing for $b \rightarrow u \ell \barν_{\ell}$ firstly at $\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$; their incorporation is essential to preserve the integrity of the integrated moments of the perturbatively re-expanded $q^2$-spectrum but necessitates histogramming from $\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$ onward even within pure perturbation theory.

*Aoife Bharucha*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper reviews advancements in calculations of decays involving heavy flavor particles, focusing on anomalies in $b\to s$, $b\to c$, and $c\to u$ transitions, CKM elements determination, and lepton universality tests, highlighting deviations from Standard Model predictions and future experimental prospects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address deviations observed in $b\to s$ and $b\to c$ transitions (potential signs of physics beyond the Standard Model) and resolve the exclusive-inclusive discrepancy in CKM elements $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$, while assessing lepton universality in semileptonic decays.

Method: Review of recent theoretical calculations, comparisons of branching ratios, angular observables, and lepton universality ratios between experimental data and Standard Model predictions.

Result: Highlights unresolved anomalies in experimental measurements, progress in CKM elements precision, and updated theoretical frameworks for testing Standard Model validity through flavor physics observables.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of these anomalies in guiding future experiments and theoretical models, suggesting physics beyond the Standard Model may be necessary to fully explain observed discrepancies.

Abstract: In the last ten years there has been great progress in calculations of decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons, and baryons containing a heavy $b$ or $c$ quark. One propelling factor has been the measurement of several anomalies in $b\to s$ and $b\to c$ transitions, these are one of the only signs of physics beyond the Standard Model. The deviations included measurements of branching ratios, angular observables and lepton universality ratios. Another factor is the exclusive-inclusive discrepancy in the determination of the CKM elements $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$. We will first review recent calculations involving $b\to s$ and $c\to u$ transitions that could shed light on the neutral current anomalies. We will then summarise the progress the determination of the CKM elements, $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$. Finally we will discuss the current theoretical status and experimental prospects for the lepton universality ratios in $b\to s$ and $b\to c$ semileptonic decays.

### [19] [Existence of the $DD^*\bar{K}^*$ and $BB^*K^*$ three-body molecular states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12010)
*Yan-Ke Chen,Lu Meng,Jun-Zhang Wang,Shi-Lin Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the existence of a three-body molecular state (DD⁎K⁎) using the one-boson-exchange model, recalibrates coupling constants using known meson states, predicts a bound state under specific conditions, and suggests experimental verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate potential three-body molecular states and reduce model dependence in meson interactions by recalibrating coupling constants based on established particles like Z_c(3900), X(3872), and T_cc(3875).

Method: One-boson-exchange model with recalibrated coupling constants derived from pole positions of known meson states. Complex scaling method used to search for resonances in the complex energy plane.

Result: A DD⁎K⁎ bound state exists if Z_c(3900) is a virtual state within ~-10 MeV of DД⁎ threshold. No resonances found. Relaxation of conditions for bottom analog BB⁎K⁎ system allows a bound state at ~-25 MeV.

Conclusion: Future experiments should refine Z_c(3900) pole measurements and search for bound states in specific decay channels to validate molecular interpretations of these states.

Abstract: We investigate the existence of the three-body molecular state composed of $DD^*\bar{K}^*$ within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. A major challenge is that while the pseudoscalar-meson couplings are well-determined, the couplings for scalar- and vector-meson exchanges render significant model dependence. To ensure the reliability of our predictions and reduce model dependence, we recalibrate the coupling constants of the OBE model. We treat the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$, or equivalently the scalar $σ$-exchange coupling constant, as the only unknown parameter. The coupling constants for the vector $ρ$- and $ω$-exchanges are determined by the pole positions of the well established states $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. We demonstrate that these parameter sets also successfully describe the $T_{cs0}(2870)$ without further tuning. For the three-body system, our results indicate that an $I\left(J^P\right)=1 / 2\left(0^{-}\right)$ three-body molecular bound state exists when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state located within approximately $-10~\text{MeV}$ of the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the complex energy plane using the complex scaling method to search for molecular resonances, though no evidence of resonances is found in considered channels. We also apply this formalism to the bottom analog $BB^*K^*$ system. In this sector, the conditions for the existence of a three-body bound state are more relaxed, as a $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state located within $-25~\text{MeV}$ below the threshold suffices, although three-body molecular resonances remain absent. We suggest that future experiments precisely measure the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$ or search for the three-body bound state in $DD\bar{K}ππ$ and $DD\bar{K}$ channels, as these efforts would mutually illuminate the nature of the associated states.

*Xu Wang,Kai-Ge Kang,Zhiguang Xiao,Han-Qing Zheng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study calculates scattering amplitudes for the lp→lpγ process using Chiral Perturbation Theory (χPT) up to O(p^3), highlighting the impact of nonzero lepton mass on low-energy muon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. Results indicate current experimental data is outside χPT's validity range, suggesting future experiments are needed to determine low-energy constants and test χPT's efficacy in probing nucleon polarizabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical predictions for differential cross-sections of lp→lpγ processes, assess the influence of lepton mass on low-energy scattering, and explore χPT's validity for determining low-energy constants (LECs) and nucleon polarizabilities.

Method: Calculations performed using χPT framework with O(p²) and O(p³) nucleon-pion Lagrangians to compute scattering amplitudes for hard-photon emission in elastic lepton-nucleon bremsstrahlung.

Result: Explicit inclusion of nonzero lepton mass significantly alters low-energy differential cross-sections for μp→μpγ. Current experimental data lies beyond χPT's validity, necessitating future experiments to constrain LECs and validate χPT's predictive power.

Conclusion: Future experimental data will enable LEC determination through χPT, enhancing understanding of nucleon generalized polarizabilities and χPT's role as a QCD effective theory at low energies.

Abstract: This study presents a tree-level calculation of the scattering amplitude for the $lp\to lpγ$ (with a hard photon) process within the framework of Chiral Perturbation Theory. Our calculations, based on the $O(p^2)$ and $O(p^3)$ nucleon-pion Lagrangians, aim to provide a theoretical prediction for the differential cross-section. The result shows that explicit inclusion of the nonzero lepton mass significantly influences the low energy differential cross section for $μp\to μp γ$ process. The kinematic region of the present experimental data is beyond the validity domain of the $χ$PT and is therefore not suitable for determining the low-energy constants (LECs). By comparing our results with future experimental data, we expect to determine the values of the LECs as a further test of $χ$PT as an effective low-energy theory of QCD. The process is of significant interest as it can help to determine the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon.

### [21] [Resonating group method for baryon-baryon interactions with unequal oscillator frequencies and its application to the $NΔ$ system in a chiral quark model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12148)
*Ke-Rang Song,Fei Huang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new RGM formalism for baryon-baryon interactions with unequal oscillator frequencies, applied to the NΔ system using a chiral SU(3) quark model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGM assumes equal oscillator frequencies for baryons, which is physically inconsistent since different baryons have different potentials due to varying quantum numbers.

Method: Developed an RGM framework allowing unequal oscillator frequencies, incorporating OGE, confinement, and meson exchanges from chiral symmetry breaking. Applied to NΔ system using a chiral SU(3) quark model to solve bound and scattering states.

Result: Demonstrated the impact of unequal oscillator frequencies through comparison with traditional methods, showing improved consistency in describing single baryons and their interactions.

Conclusion: The new formalism enhances accuracy in baryon-baryon studies by resolving inconsistencies from earlier assumptions, providing a more unified theoretical framework.

Abstract: The resonating group method (RGM) is widely used to investigate baryon-baryon interactions at the quark level, typically under the assumption that the two baryons involved share an identical harmonic-oscillator frequency. In reality, however, when a specific interaction Hamiltonian is given, different baryons should have unequal oscillator frequencies due to distinct interaction potentials induced by their different quantum numbers. In this work, we develop a new quark-level RGM formalism for baryon-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies, with the aim of describing both single baryons and baryon-baryon interactions in a consistent framework. We present the formalism for solving bound-state and scattering problems, with particular emphasis on constructing the wave functions of two-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies. The proposed formalism is then applied to the $NΔ$ system within a chiral SU(3) quark model, where the quark-quark interaction includes, in addition to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) and a phenomenological confinement potential, the nonet scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(3) symmetry. The distinctive features of the newly developed formalism are elucidated by comparing the results from the new formulation with those from traditional calculations.

*Kirtiman Ghosh,Abhishek Roy,Rameswar Sahu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Universal Extra Dimension (UED) scenarios, particularly focusing on the minimal UED framework. It explores how a nonstandard cosmological history with a low reheating temperature, caused by prolonged inflaton decay, can significantly dilute the relic abundance of Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles. This opens up previously excluded parameter spaces that are still consistent with existing experimental constraints and can be tested in future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit the dark matter phenomenology of minimal UED under nonstandard cosmological conditions, specifically addressing how entropy injection during reheating can re-open parameter space closed by standard assumptions about relic density and collider constraints.

Method: The authors solve coupled Boltzmann equations for dark matter, radiation, and inflaton energy densities, incorporating a low reheating temperature scenario. They analyze relic abundance dilution effects and compare the results with current experimental constraints (collider, direct/indirect detection).

Result: Entropy injection during reheating dilutes relic abundance by orders of magnitude, reviving parameter spaces previously excluded under standard cosmology. These revived regions remain consistent with existing limits but are testable by future experiments.

Conclusion: Nonstandard cosmological histories (like low reheating temperatures) are crucial for UED dark matter viability. The study highlights the importance of considering alternative cosmological scenarios to interpret existing constraints and design future experiments.

Abstract: In Universal Extra Dimension (UED) scenarios, the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) particle is naturally stable due to a remnant discrete symmetry, KK parity, arising from extra-dimensional compactification. This stability requires no ad hoc symmetry and renders Kaluza-Klein dark matter a well-motivated candidate, provided it reproduces the observed relic abundance. The minimal UED (mUED) framework being highly predictive is strongly constrained by the combined requirements of relic density and collider searches under standard cosmological assumptions. We revisit the dark matter phenomenology of mUED in the presence of a nonstandard cosmological history featuring a low reheating temperature driven by prolonged inflaton decay. Solving the coupled Boltzmann equations for dark matter, radiation, and inflaton energy densities, we show that entropy injection during reheating can dilute the relic abundance by orders of magnitude, reopening large regions of parameter space previously ruled out. We further demonstrate that the revived parameter space is consistent with current collider, direct-detection, and indirect-detection constraints, while remaining testable by upcoming experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces P^{α, T}_{tail}, a new variable for gamma-hadron discrimination in water-Cherenkov detectors, improving background rejection by a factor of five compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the identification of ultra-high-energy gamma rays by leveraging time-resolved signal tails in water-Cherenkov detector arrays.

Method: Developed P^{α, T}_{tail} which uses cumulative signal distributions from detector traces' time structures. Evaluated its performance against established variables like S_b, risetime, and P^α_{tail} using simulations of proton and gamma-induced showers at ~10^17 eV.

Result: Achieved a background contamination of ~2e-2 at 50% gamma efficiency, outperforming prior WCD-only methods and nearing a muon-isolating reference's performance.

Conclusion: Exploiting time-resolved signal tails significantly improves photon detection in sparse arrays, advancing capabilities for ultra-high-energy astrophysical gamma-ray studies.

Abstract: Gamma-hadron discrimination based on shower observables is essential for identifying gamma-ray astrophysical sources at the highest energies. In this work, we introduce $P^{α, T}_{\rm tail}$, a new discrimination variable for ultra-high-energy photon searches within the framework of a water-Cherenkov detector (WCD) array. The observable extends signal-integrated methods by incorporating the time structure of WCD traces, using cumulative signal distributions.
  Using simulated proton- and gamma-induced air showers at energies around $10^{17}\,\mathrm{eV}$, we evaluate the performance of $P^{α, T}_{\rm tail}$ and compare it with established WCD-based observables such as $S_b$, risetime-based variables, and the SWGO-inspired, $P^α_{\rm tail}$. The new variable attains a background contamination of roughly $2 \times 10^{-2}$ at $50\%$ gamma efficiency, improving upon existing WCD-only methods by nearly a factor of five and approaching the performance of an idealized muon-isolating reference. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting time-resolved signal tails to enhance ultra-high-energy photon searches in sparse surface arrays.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic framework for constructing operators in non-relativistic effective field theories, addressing symmetry requirements and redundancies. It uses mathematical tools like the double cover of the rotation group, extended Hilbert series, and generalized Young tableaux to build complete operator bases for various theories up to specific mass dimensions or interaction orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified method for operator construction in non-relativistic systems, eliminating redundancies from spin operators and extending applicability to diverse scenarios like heavy particle/ quark theories, pion-less effective models, and dark matter-nucleon interactions.

Method: The framework employs the double cover of the rotation group to refine Hilbert series for non-relativistic systems. It introduces generalized SU(2) semi-standard Young tableaux for operator basis construction with repeated fields. The method combines Hilbert series and Young tensor techniques for cross-validation.

Result: Complete operator bases are derived for heavy particle theory up to dimension 9, pion-less theory contact interactions up to Q^4 and three-nucleon at Q^2, and spin-1/2 dark matter-nucleon operators up to v^4.

Conclusion: The approach successfully systematizes operator construction in non-relativistic EFTs, ensuring completeness and redundancy elimination. It provides a versatile tool for future calculations in nuclear, particle, and dark matter physics.

Abstract: This work establishes a systematic framework for operator construction in the non-relativistic effective field theory, incorporating both the three dimensional Euclidean symmetry and the internal symmetries. By employing double cover of the rotation group, we extend the Hilbert series to the non-relativistic systems, and eliminates redundancies introduced by the spin operator. We also generalize the Young tensor method to the non-relativistic cases through the $SU(2)$ semi-standard Young tableaux, which allows for the construction of operator bases with repeated fields at any given mass dimension. Utilizing the Young tensor technique and Hibert series as cross-check, we obtain the complete operator bases for the following cases: heavy particle (and also heavy quark) effective theory operators up to mass dimension 9; pion-less effective theory operators, including nucleon-nucleon contact interactions up to $\mathcal{O}(Q^4)$ and three-nucleon interactions at $\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$; and finally the spin-1/2 dark matter-nucleon operators up to $\mathcal{O}(v^4)$.

### [25] [Radiating solutions in Entangled Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11188)
*Olivier Minazzoli,Maxime Wavasseur*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the Mineur--Vaidya radiating solution can be embedded within magnetic/electric fields in Entangled Relativity, showing dynamic formation of naked singularities similar to General Relativity, and this applies broadly to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether naked singularities can form dynamically in Entangled Relativity and to extend the applicability of the Mineur--Vaidya solution to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories despite previous neglect in literature.

Method: Embedded the Mineur--Vaidya solution into magnetic/electric fields within Entangled Relativity, analyzed the limit where the field vanishes, and generalized the findings to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories.

Result: Confirmed that naked singularities can form dynamically in Entangled Relativity and established the solution's validity across Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories, challenging prior assumptions.

Conclusion: Naked singularity formation is possible in Entangled Relativity and broader Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories, broadening understanding beyond General Relativity and highlighting overlooked implications in the literature.

Abstract: The Mineur--Vaidya radiating solutions satisfy $\mathcal{L}_m ~\propto~ F^2 = 0 = R$. As a consequence, it is not only a solution in General Relativity, but also in Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theories for all coupling constants. The specific case of Entangled Relativity is noteworthy because the additional scalar degree of freedom is defined from the ratio between $R$ and $\mathcal{L}_m$, which is ill-defined in this situation. In the present work, we embed the Mineur--Vaidya solution in a magnetic (or electric) field within the framework of Entangled Relativity, and show that the Mineur--Vaidya solution corresponds to the limit where the magnetic (respectively, electric) field vanishes. This notably allows us to demonstrate that, as in General Relativity, it is possible to dynamically form naked singularities in Entangled Relativity. This conclusion, in fact, applies to any Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theory, although it does not seem to be widely acknowledged in the literature.

*G. Alencar,V. H. U. Borralho,M. S. Cunha,R. R. Landim*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates analytical solutions for (3+1)-dimensional black strings and BTZ black holes with Dekel-Zhao dark matter density profiles, finding that the inner slope parameter 'a' critically affects event horizon stability, inducing naked singularities and violating the dominant energy condition due to high tangential pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how dark matter (DM) density profiles influence the spacetime geometry and properties of black strings and BTZ black holes, focusing on horizon stability, energy conditions, and thermodynamic aspects.

Method: Deriving analytical solutions for black string and BTZ spacetimes using the Dekel-Zhao DM profile, analyzing event horizon behavior, curvature scalars (Ricci and Kretschmann), and energy conditions. Calculating Hawking temperature and free energy modifications due to DM presence.

Result: The event horizon radius depends on parameter 'a'; beyond a critical value, horizons disappear leading to naked singularities. DM creates curvature singularities absent in vacuum BTZ. Dominant energy condition violated in BTZ due to tangential pressure. DM alters thermodynamic properties without destabilizing the system.

Conclusion: Dark matter's structural properties (like stiffness in Dekel-Zhao profile) critically shape spacetime geometry and causal structure, influencing horizon existence and energy condition compliance. This provides insights into DM's role in astrophysical black hole dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we obtain analytical solutions for a $(3+1)$-dimensional black string and a BTZ black hole, both sourced by the Dekel-Zhao dark matter (DM) density profile. Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions.

### [27] [A Nonlinear Endpoint of Charged Horizon Instabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11256)
*Zachary Gelles,Frans Pretorius*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper studies the numerical formation of extremal black holes by evolving a charged scalar field in a super-extremal spacetime, resulting in an extremal horizon with divergent energy density but constant charge density, revealing critical phenomena and potential curvature growth inside the horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of extremal black hole formation and their properties, such as the presence of 'hair' on the horizon and the behavior of scalar fields near extremality. Additionally, investigating whether extremal black holes act as universal critical solutions and exploring curvature divergence implications for near-threshold scenarios.

Method: Numerical simulation of charged scalar field dynamics in a super-extremal Reissner-Nordström spacetime using a fine-tuned scattering of wave packets. The approach extends prior work by Murata, Reall, and Tanahashi to include charged scalar fields.

Result: Successful construction of dynamical extremal black holes with a horizon where energy density diverges and charge density remains constant ('hair'). Observed critical phenomena similar to gravitational collapse, with extremal solutions as universal threshold configurations. Scalar field decays outside but shows unbounded curvature growth just inside the horizon. Near-threshold solutions may exhibit large curvatures observable at future null infinity.

Conclusion: Dynamical extremal black holes are critical solutions in charged scalar collapse, exhibiting universal behavior modulo 'hair' parameters. The inner horizon's curvature divergence suggests potential observable effects at future null infinity for near-extremal configurations, hinting at profound physical implications for extremal black hole validity.

Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically extremal black holes through the nonlinear evolution of a charged scalar field. Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with "hair"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity.

*Sudan Hansraj,Christian Boehmer,Ndumiso Buthelezi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to split the Ricci scalar into bulk and boundary terms in gravitational action, leading to second-order stellar structure equations free of ghosts. Analysis of the quadratic case reveals two vacuum metrics, an autonomous isotropy equation, and stable fixed curves in dynamical systems analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a new avenue in stellar dynamics by avoiding higher-order equations that may introduce ghost instabilities, and to investigate the resulting simplified equations and their solutions.

Method: Split the Ricci scalar in gravitational action into bulk (functional forms) and non-dynamical boundary terms, derive second-order stellar structure equations, analyze thermodynamics and geometry for quadratic cases, solve isotropy equation, apply dynamical systems methods (phase portraits) to assess stability.

Result: Obtained two vacuum metrics in the quadratic case, found an autonomous isotropy equation (rare in astrophysics), demonstrated stable fixed curves with nearby trajectories converging towards them in phase portraits.

Conclusion: The proposed formalism successfully avoids ghost problems, provides analytically tractable equations, and shows stable solutions through dynamical analysis, offering a promising framework for further stellar dynamics studies.

Abstract: The novel proposal to invoke the split of the Ricci scalar into bulk and boundary terms in the gravitational action, opens up a new avenue of investigation into stellar dynamics. The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves.

### [29] [Generalized entropic uncertainty relation and non-classicality in Schwarzschild black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11503)
*Rui-Jie Yao,Dong Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tighter generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for multi-measurements in many-body systems, applies it to Schwarzschild black holes, and explores the dynamics of quantum coherence and entanglement. It finds equivalence between entanglement and l₁-norm coherence for GHZ-type states and shows coherence decreases with Hawking temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance understanding of quantum non-classicality in black holes by improving uncertainty principles and analyzing quantum resources like coherence and entanglement in curved spacetime.

Method: The authors propose a novel generalized EUR for multi-measurements, derive tighter bounds, apply this to Schwarzschild black holes, and analyze the dynamical evolution of multipartite coherence and entanglement using GHZ-type states.

Result: The derived EUR shows superior tightness in black hole scenarios. Equivalence between entanglement and l₁-norm coherence for GHZ-type states is proven. Quantum coherence diminishes and uncertainty stabilizes at a maximum with rising Hawking temperature.

Conclusion: The study deepens insights into quantum resource behavior (coherence, entanglement) in curved spacetime and their vulnerability to thermal effects, contributing to quantum gravity and black hole physics.

Abstract: The uncertainty principle constitutes a fundamental pillar of quantum theory, representing one of the most distinctive features that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes.

### [30] [Precessions and parameter constraints from quasiperiodic oscillations in a rotating charged black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11525)
*R. H. Ali,Meng-He Wu,Hong Guo,Xiao-Mei Kuang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) can diagnose frame-dragging and accretion disk properties in a rotating regular magnetic black hole. By analyzing epicyclic frequencies and precession in five X-ray binaries, they constrain black hole parameters using MCMC and show their model suppresses precession frequencies compared to Kerr black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe frame-dragging effects and accretion disk physics in a rotating regular magnetic black hole's spacetime, and to constrain black hole parameters using observational QPO data from X-ray binaries.

Method: Analyzes bound orbit precession and epicyclic oscillations of test particles in the equatorial plane. Uses relativistic precession models and MCMC simulations to constrain parameters like mass, spin, magnetic charge, and nonminimal coupling (λ/M⁴ and Q/M). Examines Lense-Thirring, geodetic, and spin precession frequencies of a test gyroscope.

Result: Found that the regular magnetic black hole's parameters significantly affect epicyclic frequencies. MCMC analysis constrains BH characteristics. Their theoretical results show precession frequencies are suppressed compared to Kerr black holes.

Conclusion: QPOs are effective diagnostics for regular magnetic black holes' spacetime properties. The model provides a framework to distinguish between Kerr and non-Kerr black holes using observational data, highlighting the role of magnetic fields and nonminimal coupling in relativistic astrophysics.

Abstract: We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) as a diagnostic tool for probing frame-dragging effects and accretion disk physics in the spacetime of a rotating regular magnetic black hole (BH). Specifically, we analyze the precession of bound orbits and the epicyclic oscillations of test particles under small perturbations in the equatorial plane. We demonstrate how the BH nonminimal coupling parameter (lambda/M^4) and dimensionless magnetic charge (Q/M) significantly influence the three fundamental epicyclic frequencies. By applying the relativistic precession model and employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC), we constrain the BH characteristic parameters, including mass, spin, magnetic charge, and nonminimal coupling, using observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries: GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, and GRS 1915+105. Furthermore, we examine the Lense-Thirring, geodetic, and general spin precession frequencies of a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer around the black hole. Our theoretical results indicate that the regular charged black hole suppresses these precession frequencies compared with the Kerr black hole case.

*Si-Han Li,Hui-Chen Yang,Rui-Yang Xu,Shu-Min Wu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper shows that the quantum entanglement of four-qubit cluster states in a Schwarzschild black hole's spacetime remains constant despite increasing Hawking temperature, defying expectations that gravitational effects degrade entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the belief that black hole gravitational effects universally degrade quantum entanglement, especially for bosonic fields, by studying fermionic fields in curved spacetime.

Method: Investigated the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state (CL₄) in Schwarzschild black hole spacetime, measuring 1-3 tangle as Hawking temperature increases.

Result: The quantum entanglement (1-3 tangle) of CL₄ remained strictly constant despite rising Hawking temperature, showing 'complete freezing of maximal entanglement'.

Conclusion: CL₄ states can preserve maximal entanglement in black hole environments, acting as a high-quality quantum resource for relativistic quantum information processing.

Abstract: Gravitational effects associated with black holes are widely believed to universally degrade quantum entanglement, with the loss of maximal entanglement being particularly severe and even irreversible for bosonic fields. In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state ($CL_4$) for fermionic fields in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations. Moreover, our results indicate that, within a relativistic framework, the $CL_4$ state constitutes a high-quality quantum resource with potential applications in relativistic quantum information processing, and may significantly improve the performance of such protocols.

### [32] [On the numerical evaluation of the `exact' Post-Newtonian parameters in Brans-Dicke and Entangled Relativity theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11811)
*Thomas Chehab,Olivier Minazzoli*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses new methods to calculate exact post-Newtonian parameters in Brans-Dicke theories, showing deviations from standard parameters by over 80% in extreme cases like neutron stars. It connects these parameters to the Damour-Esposito Farèse formalism and evaluates testability of Entangled Relativity, highlighting dependence on the matter Lagrangian choice (\mathcal{L}_m=-\rho vs \mathcal{L}_m=T).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional post-Newtonian approximations for strongly gravitating bodies and explore the testability of modified gravity theories like Entangled Relativity through precise parameter calculations.

Method: The methods involve numerically computing exact Brans-Dicke parameters via Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, establishing links with α_{DEF} parameters, and applying the framework to the Sun, Earth, and neutron stars under different matter Lagrangian assumptions.

Result: Significant deviations (over 80%) between exact parameters and standard post-Newtonian values are found in high-density scenarios. The choice of \mathcal{L}_m critically impacts testability: with \mathcal{L}_m=-\rho, current experiments can constrain the theory, while \mathcal{L}_m=T yields GR-compatibility except in extreme electromagnetic field conditions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using exact parameters is essential for accurate testing of modified gravity theories. The viability of Entangled Relativity as a testable theory hinges on the adopted matter Lagrangian, urging further observational efforts targeting compact objects and precise parameter measurements.

Abstract: In context of Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theories of gravity, it has recently been obtained that the post-Newtonian parameters should be generalized in the context of strongly gravitating bodies, and that its generalization -- the so-called $\textit{exact parameters}$ -- actually depends on the pressure and energy density of a considered celestial body. Here we develop two new methods to numerically obtain the $\textit{exact parameters}$ by means of usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff computation, and find that the difference with the value of standard post-Newtonian parameters can be more than 80% in some situations. We also provide the connection with the Damour-Esposito Farèse non-pertubative parameter $α_{DEF}$. We then apply the methodology to the case of Entangled Relativity, and derive these exact parameters for the Sun and the Earth, as well as for neutron stars. We argue that current and foreseeable experiments are likely able to constrain the theory under the assumption that $\mathcal{L}_m=-ρ$, where $ρ$ is the total energy density. If $\mathcal{L}_m=T$ instead, as often advocated in the literature, then there is no deviation with respect to General Relativity and the prospects of testing Entangled Relativity become much more remote in time, as only compact objects with extreme electric or magnetic fields could lead to some deviation from General Relativity.

### [33] [pespace: A new tool of GPU-accelerated and auto-differentiable response generation and likelihood evaluation for space-borne gravitational wave detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12011)
*Rui Niu,Chang Feng,Wen Zhao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces the software tool `pespace`, designed for full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries using space-borne detectors like LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. It leverages `taichi-lang` for high-performance computing and automatic differentiation. The study demonstrates that higher gravitational waveform modes and multi-detector networks enhance parameter estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of robust data analysis software is critical for upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors operating in the milli-Hertz band. Existing tools may lack efficient parallelization, automatic differentiation, or comprehensive waveform models. This paper addresses these gaps by creating a unified framework.

Method: The method involves implementing `pespace` using `taichi-lang` for parallel computation and automatic differentiation. Waveforms `PhenomXAS` and `PhenomXHM` are reimplemented in `tiwave`. Bayesian parameter estimation is performed across three scenarios: single detector with dominant mode, single detector with higher modes, and multi-detector network with higher modes.

Result: Results show higher modes resolve parameter degeneracies, while detector networks improve source property measurements. Automatic differentiation via `taichi-lang` accurately computes Fisher matrices without manual tuning. Fisher matrix posteriors closely match Bayesian results for subsets of parameters.

Conclusion: The `pespace` framework provides an efficient, scalable solution for gravitational wave parameter estimation. It emphasizes the importance of higher modes and multi-detector observations for accurate analysis. The tool's design supports future detector network science and automated statistical methods.

Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors will expand the scope of gravitational wave astronomy to the milli-Hertz band in the near future. The development of data analysis software infrastructure at the current stage is crucial. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pespace} which can be used for the full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries with detectors including LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \texttt{PhenomXAS} and \texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.

*Idrus Husin Belfaqih,Martin Bojowald,Suddhasattwa Brahma,Erick I. Duque*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores emergent modified gravity's role in holonomy effects from loop quantum gravity, demonstrating consistency in Hawking radiation calculations. It shows how holonomy corrections slow black hole evaporation through greybody factors and introduces a net stress-energy tensor for evaporation rate analysis via energy conservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in incorporating holonomy effects from loop quantum gravity into a covariant framework, ensuring consistent black hole solutions and exploring their implications on Hawking radiation and evaporation dynamics.

Method: The study employs emergent modified gravity to model holonomy effects, computes corrected semi-classical stress-energy tensors considering backreaction, and utilizes covariant approaches to analyze Hawking thermal distributions and evaporation rates.

Result: Holonomy corrections slow evaporation when the modification function decreases monotonically, internal consistency in Hawking radiation results due to general covariance, and a net stress-energy tensor is introduced to directly compute evaporation rates via energy conservation.

Conclusion: Emergent modified gravity successfully bridges loop quantum gravity's holonomy effects with covariant dynamics, offering a robust framework for understanding quantum gravity effects on black hole evaporation and stress-energy conservation.

Abstract: Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant framework for holonomy effects in models of loop quantum gravity with consistent black hole solutions coupled to a scalar field. Several independent studies of the Hawking thermal distribution are shown here to lead to the same final result. This internal consistency is a direct consequence of general covariance, which is analogous to the situation in classical general relativity but highly nontrivial in the context of modified canonical gravity. Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states. Thanks to these results, the new concept of a net stress-energy tensor makes it possible to compute evaporation rates directly from energy conservation laws.

*Erasmo Caponio,Anna valeria Germinario,Antonio Masiello*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper unifies the concepts of photon and massive particle hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes by showing their correspondence to totally geodesic surfaces under specific Randers and Jacobi-Randers Finsler structures. It also establishes existence and multiplicity of solutions for the Lorentz force equation under fixed parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework connecting photon and massive particle hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes, bridging their geometric properties via Finsler geometries and extending understanding of solutions to the Lorentz force equation.

Method: Analyzes Killing-invariant timelike hypersurfaces, linking their types (photon/massive particle) to total geodesy of their spatial cross-sections in associated Randers and Jacobi-Randers Finsler structures. Uses geometric methods to prove existence/multiplicity results for Lorentz force equation solutions.

Result: Demonstrates equivalence between hypersurface types and geodesic properties under specified metrics. Proves existence of solutions connecting points to Killing vector field flows and periodic non-constant projections.

Conclusion: The unified Finsler geometric framework successfully characterizes both photon and massive particle hypersurfaces, offering new insights into their structure and the behavior of charged particles in stationary spacetimes.

Abstract: We revisit the notion of massive particle hypersurfaces and place it within a unified framework alongside photon hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes. More precisely, for Killing-invariant timelike hypersurfaces $T=\mathbb{R}\times S_0$, where $S_0$ is a smooth embedded surface in a spacelike slice $S$ of the stationary spacetime, we show that $T$ is a photon hypersurface or a massive particle hypersurface if and only if $S_0$ is totally geodesic with respect to certain associated Finsler structures on the slice: a Randers metric governing null geodesics and a Jacobi--Randers metric governing timelike solutions of the Lorentz force equation at fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio. We also prove existence and multiplicity results for proper-time parametrized solutions of the Lorentz force equation with fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio, either connecting a point to a flow line of the Killing vector field or having periodic, non-constant projection on $S$.

*Bekir Baytaş,Patrick Rodrigues,Nelson Yokomizo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how the spin-statistics relation in quantum field theory is affected when Poincaré symmetry is replaced by general covariance in quantum gravity, finding that gravitational fields can exhibit bosonic, fermionic, or mixed statistics in loop quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the gravitational field must adhere to bosonic statistics in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework, given that Poincaré invariance—the basis for the spin-statistics theorem—is lost in curved spacetime.

Method: Implementing general covariance via invariance under active diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity, studying the kinematical state space of the gravitational field.

Result: The kinematical states of the gravitational field include bosonic states as well as subspaces with fermionic or mixed statistics, challenging the assumption that gravity must obey bosonic statistics exclusively.

Conclusion: The loss of Poincaré symmetry in quantum gravity allows for non-bosonic statistics in gravitational fields, suggesting a broader statistical framework beyond standard expectations.

Abstract: The relation between spin and statistics in quantum field theory relies on Poincaré invariance, a symmetry that is lost in the presence of a gravitational field, and replaced in general relativity by the principle of general covariance. In a nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, beyond the picture of gravitational perturbations propagating on a flat background, it is an open question whether the gravitational field must still satisfy a bosonic statistics. By implementing the principle of general covariance through the requirement of invariance under active diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity, we find that the space of kinematical states of the gravitational field includes not only bosonic states, but also subspaces of fermionic and mixed statistics.

*Yang Zhao,Yungui Gong*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how different dark matter (DM) distribution models affect the orbital dynamics and gravitational wave signals of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). It shows that relativistic treatments incorporating radial pressure are crucial for accurate predictions, as non-relativistic models lead to significant discrepancies in detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of DM distribution treatments on EMRI dynamics and gravitational wave emissions, ensuring accurate detectability of DM halos through relativistic modeling.

Method: The study compares DM density profiles derived from mass current/energy-momentum tensor (using distribution functions) with those from an anisotropic fluid model (Einstein cluster ansatz). It analyzes orbital evolution, waveform dephasing, and detection mismatches under different models.

Result: Relativistic models with radial pressure differ significantly from non-relativistic fluid models. These differences lead to substantial changes in waveform dephasing and detectability thresholds of DM halos.

Conclusion: Radial pressure and fully relativistic DM modeling are essential for precise descriptions of EMRI dynamics and observational signatures, impacting the detectability of DM halos in gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: We investigate different treatments of dark matter (DM) distributions surrounding extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) to assess their impact on orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission. Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms. By analyzing waveform dephasing and mismatches, we show that a fully relativistic treatment of DM distributions can substantially alter the detectability thresholds of DM halos. Our results demonstrate that radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for accurately describing the dynamics and observational signatures of EMRIs embedded in DM halos.

### [38] [Primordial Black Hole Formation in Dust-Radiation Bouncing Cosmologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12057)
*Xuan Ye,Luiz Felipe Demetrio,Eduardo Jose Barroso,Shen-Feng Yan,Nelson Pinto-Neto*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates primordial black hole (PBH) formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, finding that radiation pressure and two-fluid dynamics significantly suppress PBH production despite enhanced perturbations during contraction phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether bouncing cosmologies, particularly those with dust-radiation mixtures, can produce measurable PBH abundances given their potential to amplify early universe perturbations.

Method: A unified framework combining semi-analytical methods for curvature power spectra, dynamical-system analysis of Jeans length, extended three-zone collapse modeling for two-fluid systems, and two criteria for collapse thresholds.

Result: PBH mass fractions are extremely low across all tested masses (10^-17 to 10^13 solar masses) because the critical curvature perturbation threshold (~1e-21) far exceeds achievable power spectra values. Radiation effects and multi-fluid dynamics suppress PBH formation compared to pure-dust scenarios.

Conclusion: Dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies alone are insufficient to produce significant PBH populations without additional mechanisms to enhance curvature perturbations beyond standard amplification effects.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe and may have an enhanced abundance in bouncing cosmologies, where a long contracting phase can amplify perturbations. We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(ζ_c \sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how the microscopic structure of quantum foam and nonextensive effects relate in cosmological models using Barrow--Tsallis entropy, establishing exact relationships between parameters and assessing fractional derivatives for late-time universe evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding the role of cosmological horizon's microscopic degrees of freedom in universe evolution, considering both quantum gravity and nonextensive effects from long-range interactions.

Method: Applied a general method for cosmological model parameter estimation using Barrow--Tsallis entropy, linking quantum foam parameters with nonextensive effects and evaluating fractional derivatives' applicability.

Result: Discovered exact relationships between quantum foam and nonextensive parameters, and assessed fractional derivatives' feasibility for late-time universe modeling, with parameter uncertainties tied to cosmographic data precision.

Conclusion: The derived relationships provide a clear framework connecting microscopic quantum gravity effects with macroscopic nonextensive cosmology, with future precision relying on improved cosmographic measurements.

Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges of quantum gravity is to understand how the microscopic degrees of freedom of the cosmological horizon shape the evolution of the Universe. One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters.

### [40] [Black Holes Trapped by Ghosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12101)
*Cheng-Yong Zhang,Yunqi Liu,Bin Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper reveals a previously unknown nonlinear phase in the relaxation of post-violent cosmic events, where a 'ghost' saddle-node bifurcation in phase space traps the black hole remnant, delaying linear ringdown and producing a distinct quiet period followed by a burst and delayed ringdown. This phenomenon has universal implications across various astrophysical objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the long-standing assumption that black holes rapidly enter a linear relaxation phase. The study aims to uncover new physics in the transient dynamics after extreme cosmic events, filling gaps in our understanding of gravitational wave signals and providing new observational targets.

Method: Using numerical simulations and bifurcation analysis, the authors examined the post-merger evolution of black holes. They identified a nonlinear bottleneck phase caused by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the system and delays linear behavior. They derived a power-law scaling for the delay timescale and analyzed the resulting radiation patterns.

Result: A new nonlinear regime preceding the standard ringdown was discovered, characterized by a prolonged quiescent phase followed by a burst and delayed ringdown. The saddle-node ghost structure in phase space explains this behavior, and the dynamics exhibit universality applicable to neutron stars and boson stars.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave astronomy must account for nonlinear transient phases in interpreting signals from merging compact objects. The predicted quiescence-burst signatures are testable with future observational data, offering a new lens to study black hole dynamics and multiboson star systems.

Abstract: Violent cosmic events, from black hole mergers to stellar collapses, often leave behind highly excited black hole remnants that inevitably relax to equilibrium. The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations.

*Bartosz Grygielski,Jakub Mielczarek*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces generalized spin networks in Loop Quantum Gravity using quantum channels (Kraus operators) to account for environmental effects at Planck scales, preserving gauge invariance and enabling a Hilbert space formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Loop Quantum Gravity's spin networks to include environmental effects via quantum channels, as traditional unitary holonomies may insufficiently describe Planck scale phenomena.

Method: 1) Incorporates general quantum channels (CPTP maps) into spin network structures, ensuring gauge invariance through Kraus operator transformations. 2) Defines generalized spin network states using Kraus operators. 3) Proposes a new inner product to construct a Hilbert space framework. 4) Provides examples with Wilson loops and dipole networks.

Result: Demonstrates compatibility of Kraus operator transformations with spin network gauge invariance. Constructs mathematically consistent generalized states and Hilbert space structures for non-unitary transformations in LQG.

Conclusion: Quantum channel extensions provide a viable approach to modeling environmental interactions in Loop Quantum Gravity, offering a pathway to incorporate decoherence and non-unitary processes at Planck scales without sacrificing core symmetries.

Abstract: Spin networks in Loop Quantum Gravity are traditionally described by unitary holonomies corresponding to noiseless transformations. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators. Furthermore, the associated notion of an inner product is proposed, allowing for introduction of the Hilbert space. We illustrate these constructions with examples involving a Wilson loop and a dipole network.

*Yu Liang,Yuhao Cui,Kai Lin,Sen Guo,V. H. Satheeshkumar,Yang Huang,Yang-Yi Sun,Elcio Abdalla*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the unusual Einstein cross images of galaxy HerS-3, proposing that compact stars as gravitational lenses cause the central bright spot and may lack secondary images, offering new observational criteria to distinguish regular stars from black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of HerS-3's unusual Einstein cross with a bright central spot motivated the study of gravitational lensing effects by compact stars to explain this phenomenon and differentiate their optical features from those of black holes.

Method: Analysis of gravitational lensing patterns produced by regular stars compared to black holes, focusing on the presence/absence of secondary images and brightness distribution in Einstein cross configurations.

Result: Proposed that compact stars' lensing creates central bright spots and potentially partial or complete absence of secondary images, which can serve as observational criteria for identifying regular stars.

Conclusion: The study suggests that observing lensing characteristics like missing secondary images and bright central spots could aid in identifying regular stars versus black holes in future astronomical surveys.

Abstract: Recently, astronomers discovered unusual Einstein cross images of the galaxy HerS-3, which feature a bright central spot. Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.

### [43] [DeepRed: an architecture for redshift estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11281)
*Alessandro Meroni,Nicolò Oreste Pinciroli Vago,Piero Fraternali*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline for estimating redshifts from astronomical images. It evaluates ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer architectures, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy (up to 55%) over existing methods on simulated and real datasets. Results are robust across galaxy types and observational conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current redshift estimation methods struggle with generalization across diverse morphologies (galaxies, gravitational lenses, lensed supernovae) and observational conditions. The authors aim to develop a scalable, interpretable solution that works on heterogeneous datasets.

Method: DeepRed tests multiple deep learning architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, MLP-Mixer) and ensembles. It compares against seven baselines (A1, A3, NetZ, PhotoZ, HOG+SVR) using simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) data. Performance was measured via Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation (NMAD). SHAP analysis assessed feature relevance.

Result: On simulated data (DeepGraviLens), DeepRed reduces NMAD by 46-55% vs best baseline. On KiDS, performance improved by 16-27% on lensed objects. SDSS non-lensed galaxies saw 5% improvement. SHAP analysis confirmed models focus on relevant image regions.

Conclusion: Deep learning with modern architectures provides a robust, scalable approach for redshift estimation across heterogeneous astronomical datasets, surpassing traditional and neural network baselines. The method's interpretability via SHAP strengthens trust in predictions.

Abstract: Estimating redshift is a central task in astrophysics, but its measurement is costly and time-consuming. In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development and performance of two calibration sources (W-band and D-band) for the AliCPT-1 telescope, which is designed to detect B-mode signals from gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background. These sources are crucial for calibrating optical parameters like beam patterns and polarization angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure accurate calibration of the AliCPT-1 telescope's optical performance (far field beam, sidelobes, spectral response, polarization angle, and cross-polar beam response) for reliable measurement of B-mode signals linked to inflationary gravitational waves.

Method: The authors designed and tested W-band and D-band calibration sources tailored for the AliCPT-1. They likely performed laboratory tests and deployed these sources during pre/post-observation calibration campaigns to measure beam characteristics and polarization properties.

Result: The calibration sources were successfully developed and validated, providing accurate measurements necessary for the telescope's optical characterization. This ensures reliable data collection for studying primordial gravitational waves.

Conclusion: The developed calibration sources are essential for maintaining the AliCPT-1 telescope's performance, enabling precise polarization mapping and enhancing its capability to detect elusive B-mode signals from the early universe.

Abstract: Ali Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Telescope (AliCPT-1) is the first Chinese cosmic microwave background experiment aiming to make sensitive polarization maps of the potential B-mode signal from inflationary gravitational waves. The telescope was deployed on the Tibet Ali site at 5250 m above sea level in early 2025. Before and after each observation season, the instrument performance must be carefully calibrated, including the far field beam performance, far sidelobe, spectral response, polarization angle, and cross-polar beam response. To characterize these optical performances, several calibrators have been developed. We developed a W-band source and a D-band source for the AliCPT-1 telescope's beam characterizations. We present the design and performance of the two calibration sources.

*Liangpeng Xie,Yifei Zhang,Zhengwei Li,Zhouhui Liu,Shibo Shu,Junjie Zhou,Xufang Li,Haoyu Li,He Gao,Yudong Gu,Xuefeng Lu,Yong Zhao,Congzhan Liu*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the first successful use of an annular AlMn TES in X-ray detection, achieving an energy resolution below 0.1% (FWHM of 12.1 ±0.3 eV at 17.48 keV), showcasing its potential for advanced X-ray spectrometers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlMn TESs offer simpler fabrication, tunable critical temperature, and ease of use compared to bilayer TESs, yet their application in X-ray detection was previously unexplored. The motivation was to leverage these advantages for high-resolution X-ray spectrometry.

Method: The researchers developed an annular AlMn TES structure, tested it in a dilution refrigerator with a SQUID amplifier, and measured its performance through energy resolution tests at 17.48 keV X-ray energy.

Result: The AlMn TES achieved a FWHM of 12.1 ±0.3 eV at 17.48 keV, representing an energy resolution below 0.1%, marking the first such achievement with AlMn TES in X-ray detection.

Conclusion: The results validate AlMn TES's viability for high-resolution X-ray detection, offering a promising alternative to existing technologies with its simplicity and tunable properties.

Abstract: The superconducting Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) is a critical technology for next-generation X-ray spectrometers, known for its exceptional energy resolution. In the last decade, TESs based on AlMn alloy films have been extensively used in several cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The advantages of simple fabrication process and easily tunable critical temperature make them an alternative to bilayer TESs. However, they have rarely been applied to X-ray detection until now. We developed an annular AlMn TES for X-ray detection and tested it in a dilution refrigerator with a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) amplifier, achieving an Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 12.1 +- 0.3 eV at 17.48 keV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an AlMn TES achieving an energy resolution below 0.1%, highlighting its potential for high-resolution X-ray detection.

### [46] [Testing and Validation of the Updated Pixel-Based Non-Linearity Calibration File for WFC3/IR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12110)
*K. Huynh,V. Bajaj,M. Marinelli,J. Mack,S. Shenoy,N. Grogin*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: A new pixel-based linearity correction (Shenoy et al. 2025) significantly improves WFC3/IR data linearity at high fluence levels (>50,000 e-), reduces erroneous cosmic ray flags, and enhances photometric accuracy. The updated NLINFILE reference files were implemented, with minimal impact on HST flux standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequate correction of non-linear response in WFC3/IR data at high photon fluences by the existing calwf3 pipeline's polynomial method, resulting in errors and incorrect cosmic ray identifications.

Method: Testing and implementation of a pixel-based linearity correction developed by Shenoy et al. (2025), using diverse image types/sources. Updated NLINFILE reference files (9au15283i lin.fits and a2412448i lin.fits) were deployed to calibrate WFC3/IR data in the archive.

Result: The new method improves linearity by up to 7% at fluences near saturation (80,000 e-), reduces erroneous cosmic ray flags (especially in Quad 1), and achieves 0.1-0.2% adjustments in IR zeropoints with no significant impact on flux standards compared to previous values.

Conclusion: The pixel-based correction effectively addresses high-fluence linearity issues, enhancing data quality and calibration accuracy. The updated reference files are now standard for reprocessing archived WFC3/IR observations.

Abstract: The WFC3\IR channel has an innate non-linear response to incident photons, which is corrected for in the calwf3 pipeline with the NLINFILE reference file. The 2009 solution is based on an average polynomial correction for each IR quadrant and is found to be poorly constrained at high fluence levels (e-) approaching the saturation limit. Using a variety of image types, sources, and sample sequences, we test a new pixel-based linearity correction developed by Shenoy et al. (2025). In nearly all cases, the new correction improves the linearity at fluence levels higher than 50,000 e-, with improvements up to 7% for pixels with fluences approaching the saturation limit (80,000 e-) in the last ima reads. The pixel-based solution also significantly decreases the number of cosmic rays erroneously flagged (due to non-linearity correction errors) during ramp fitting in calwf3, leading to improved photometric accuracy in the calibrated flt data and higher signal-to-noise ratios, particularly in Quad 1 (upper-left detector quadrant). Because the new solution tends to make sources brighter, we recalibrate the five HST flux standards used to compute the IR zeropoints and find a negligible impact (0.1-0.2%) on the published values by Calamida et al. (2024), smaller than the RMS dispersion (0.5%) in the observed to synthetic flux ratios for all five flux standards. The new NLINFILE 9au15283i lin.fits was delivered to CRDS in October 2025 and will be used to reprocess all WFC3/IR imaging and grism observations in the MAST archive. An updated reference file a2412448i lin.fits was delivered in February 2026, improving the results at the highest fluence levels by a few tenths of a percent.

*Robyn L. Munoz,Christian T. Byrnes,Will J. Roper*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces aurel, an open-source Python package for automating relativistic calculations. It combines symbolic and numerical methods, uses efficient caching, and supports data from analytical and Numerical Relativity sources, aiding in post-processing NR simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adopting Numerical Relativity (NR) is rising, necessitating a post-processing tool that simplifies relativistic computations, handles nonlinearities, and manages diverse data sources efficiently.

Method: aurel employs caching/dependency-tracking for efficient computation. Symbolic extensions via SymPy enhance tensorial calculations. Numerical components utilize finite-difference methods on spacetime/matter data arrays, supporting both analytical and NR simulation inputs.

Result: aurel provides a flexible framework enabling users to compute relativistic quantities (e.g., curvature, matter kinematics) efficiently using symbolic and numerical approaches. Helper functions simplify NR data integration from standard codes

Conclusion: As NR adoption grows, aurel serves as a critical post-processing tool democratizing access to relativistic calculations, bridging symbolic math, numerical data, and ease of use.

Abstract: \texttt{aurel} is an open-source Python package designed to \emph{au}tomatically calculate \emph{rel}ativistic quantities. It uses an efficient, flexible and user-friendly caching and dependency-tracking system, ideal for managing the highly nonlinear nature of general relativity. The package supports both symbolic and numerical calculations. The symbolic part extends \texttt{SymPy} with additional tensorial calculations. The numerical part computes a wide range of tensorial quantities, such as curvature, matter kinematics and much more, directly from any spacetime and matter data arrays using finite-difference methods. Inputs can be either generated from analytical expressions or imported from Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, with helper functions provided to read in data from standard NR codes. Given the increasing use of NR, \texttt{aurel} offers a timely post-processing tool to support the popularisation of this field.

### [48] [3D insights into SN 1987A: ALMA observations compared to hydrodynamical explosion simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11259)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes ALMA observations of SN 1987A, revealing 3D molecular distributions of CO and SiO. The data supports binary-merger blue supergiant progenitors but highlights inadequate Si mixing in models. The neutron-star kick's direction is inferred toward the observer at ~45°N based on ejecta dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate SN 1987A's ejecta structure and progenitor nature using high-resolution ALMA data, comparing observations with hydrodynamical models to validate explosion scenarios and mixing processes.

Method: High spatial resolution ALMA observations (0.03-0.06") at two epochs mapped 3D distributions of CO and SiO. These were compared against Prometheus-HotB models for 10 progenitors, including blue/red supergiants.

Result: CO mass distributions match binary-merger blue supergiant models; SiO discrepancies suggest insufficient progenitor-stage Si mixing. The CO-ejecta centre of mass implies a neutron-star kick direction ~45°N toward the observer.

Conclusion: Binary-merger blue supergiant progenitors best explain CO observations, but SiO challenges require improved mixing physics in models. The inferred neutron-star kick direction provides clues about SN 1987A's explosion asymmetry.

Abstract: We obtain three-dimensional distributions of CO and SiO molecules from high spatial resolution (0.03--0.06") ALMA observations of SN 1987A at two different epochs. The evolution between these two epochs is consistent with homologous expansion. From these 3D maps, we reconstruct the 3D mass distributions of the ejecta in CO and SiO molecules, which we compare with those obtained by state-of-the-art, long-time hydrodynamical supernova explosion models computed with the Prometheus-HotB code for 10 different progenitors, including both red and blue supergiants. The models which best match the mass distributions correspond to explosions of binary-merger blue supergiant progenitors; at least two such models approximately reproduce the observed CO morphology. In contrast, the SiO velocity distribution and morphology are not as well reproduced in these models, indicating insufficient mixing of Si into the outer layers already at the progenitor stage. The theoretical models suggest a strong correlation between the centre of mass of the densest carbon- and oxygen-rich ejecta and the direction of the neutron-star kick. If such a correlation also applies to the CO emission in the ejecta of SN 1987A, the kick of the compact remnant is expected to point towards the observer, at an angle of approximately $45^\circ$ to the north.

*Silvia Conforti,Luca Zampieri,Michele Fiori,Alessia Spolon,Giampiero Naletto,Aleksandr Burtovoi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents new measurements of phase lag between optical and X-ray pulsations in the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 and analyzes orbital timing to reveal a parabolic evolution of the orbital period, indicating mass loss from the companion star.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of multiwavelength pulsations in transitional millisecond pulsars and investigate orbital dynamics through timing analysis.

Method: Timing analysis of optical data from Aqueye+ (2021–2023) and X-ray data from NICER (2023), measuring phase lag and tracking $T_{\rm{asc}}$ changes.

Result: Observed 20 s/year increase in $T_{\rm{asc}}$, parabolic orbital evolution pointing to mass loss from the donor, and a phase lag of 112.3 µs confirming common emission origin.

Conclusion: The findings support synchrotron emission models for multiwavelength pulsations and indicate non-conservative mass transfer in the binary system.

Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) are old neutron stars spun up by accretion from a low-mass companion. These objects can switch between two emission regimes: rotation-powered radio pulsar and accreting X-ray pulsar. The origin of their optical and X-ray pulsations is still debated, although one model attributes them to synchrotron emission produced in a shock between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow. The small phase lag observed between optical and X-ray pulses in PSR J1023+0038 supports a common origin. We present a new measurement of the phase lag between optical and X-ray pulse profiles of PSR J1023+0038 and investigate the evolution of the time of passage at the ascending node ($T_{\rm{asc}}$) up to 2023. We performed a timing analysis of optical observations obtained with Aqueye+ between 2021 and 2023 and of X-ray data from NICER in 2023. We derive updated values of $T_{\rm{asc}}$ and measure the optical - X-ray phase lag from simultaneous observations. We find that $T_{\rm{asc}}$ increases by about 20 s per year. In January 2023, we measure a phase lag of $0.067 \pm 0.018$, corresponding to $112.3 \pm 30.7\,μ$s. Since 2017, the evolution of $T_{\rm{asc}}$ follows a parabolic trend, indicating an increase in the orbital period and orbital separation of the system. This behaviour is consistent with non-conservative Roche-lobe overflow, with the donor losing mass at a rate much higher than the accretion rate. The phase lag measurement further supports a common origin of the optical and X-ray pulsations.

### [50] [Measurement prospects for the pair-instability mass cutoff with gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11282)
*Matthew Mould,Jack Heinzel,Sofia Alvarez-Lopez,Cailin Plunkett,Noah E. Wolfe,Salvatore Vitale*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of gravitational-wave data from binary black holes challenges the prediction of a pair-instability supernova mass gap, finding that while current data support a possible mass cutoff between 40-50 M☉, future observations (O4) will reduce uncertainties and better constrain stellar models and cosmological parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the robustness of a potential mass cutoff in black-hole populations caused by pair-instability supernovae, using simulated gravitational-wave catalogs to test whether the observed GWTC-4 data reliably indicates this cutoff and to assess future observational potential.

Method: The authors generated comprehensive simulated gravitational-wave catalogs with Bayesian parameter estimation, applied parametric population models, and used the nonparametric PixelPop model to analyze the GWTC-4 data. They tested for the presence of a mass cutoff, quantified uncertainties in measuring the cutoff mass, and examined implications for nuclear reaction rates (e.g., C(a,g)O) and the Hubble parameter H₀.

Result: Confident identification of a 40-50 M☉ cutoff is uncertain in current GWTC-4-like catalogs but results are consistent with better constraints. Future O4 data could reduce cutoff mass uncertainty by 20%+, constrain the ^12C(α,γ)^16O reaction rate (S₃₀₀ ≥ ~125 keV b at 90% credibility), and improve H₀ measurements. Nonparametric analysis (PixelPop) showed mass features without requiring a sharp cutoff, but parametric models performed well in predictive tests.

Conclusion: Current gravitational-wave data alone cannot definitively confirm a pair-instability mass gap, but upcoming observations will enhance constraints. Robust astrophysical claims require rigorous testing of both parametric and nonparametric models with simulated datasets to interpret population-level inferences accurately.

Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.

*Atsushi Tanimoto,Keiichi Wada,Yuki Kudoh,Nozomu Kawakatu,Mariko Nomura,Hirokazu Odaka*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses radiative hydrodynamic simulations and XSTAR calculations to examine the covering factors of HI and HII gases, finding discrepancies between theoretical C₂₂ and X-ray observations at low Eddington ratios, suggesting extended Compton-thin gas beyond modeled regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why the covering factor depends on the Eddington ratio as observed in X-ray data, analyzing the angular distribution of HI and HII through simulations.

Method: Conducted 2D radiative hydrodynamic simulations to model HI/HII distributions, followed by 1D XSTAR photoionization calculations to compute Compton-thin (C₂₂) and Compton-thick (C₂₄) covering factors.

Result: 1) C₂₂ for HI/HII remains ~70% and HI alone ~30% irrespective of Eddington ratio. 2) C₂₄ matches HI's C₂₂. 3) C₂₄ aligns with X-ray observations. 4) C₂₂ matches observations at high Eddington but underestimates at low ratios. 5) Extended Compton-thin gas (>10 pc beyond simulations) needed to reconcile low-Eddington discrepancies.

Conclusion: The Eddington ratio dependency of covering factors observed in X-rays isn't captured in simulations for C₂₂ at low ratios, implying missing extended gas structures in current models.

Abstract: To investigate the origin of the dependence of the covering factor on the Eddington ratio suggested by X-ray observations, we examined the angular distribution of HI and HII based on two-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations. To calculate the Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ and Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI alone, we performed one-dimensional photoionization equilibrium calculations with the XSTAR code based on radiative hydrodynamic simulations. The results obtained are as follows. (1) The Compton-thin covering factor $C_{22}$ of HI and HII is independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $70\%$, while $C_{22}$ of HI alone is also independent of the Eddington ratio and is approximately $30\%$. (2) The Compton-thick covering factor $C_{24}$ of HI has the same value as $C_{22}$ of HI. (3) Our $C_{24}$ is consistent with that obtained from X-ray observations. (4) Our $C_{22}$ agrees with that obtained from X-ray observations in a high Eddington ratio, while our $C_{22}$ is smaller than that from X-ray observations in a low Eddington ratio. (5) To explain the difference between $C_{22}$ obtained from theoretical calculations and that inferred from X-ray observations, a Compton-thin gas is required in regions extending at least $10~\mathrm{pc}$ beyond the current computational regions.

Reardon,Christopher J. Russell,Ryan M. Shannon,Jacob Cardinal Tremblay,Jingbo Wang,Lei Zhang,Andrew Zic*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array's third data release to detect anisotropies in the nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), using radiometer and spherical harmonic methods. A potential hotspot at 5.26 nHz with p-value 0.016 was found but deemed likely noise, indicating no significant anisotropy yet. Future angular power spectrum measurements may help identify GWB origins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish between potential sources of the GWB (like supermassive black holes or early-Universe processes) by detecting sky-localized anisotropic signals, as isotropy cannot alone confirm the origin.

Method: Applied radiometer analysis and spherical harmonic decomposition to the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array data, calculating angular power in the lowest five frequency bins, and compared results against isotropy null hypothesis thresholds.

Result: Identified a non-significant hotspot at 5.26 nHz (p=0.016 attributed to noise fluctuations), with no statistically significant anisotropy detected across tested frequency bins.

Conclusion: Current data lacks conclusive evidence for GWB anisotropy but emphasizes the future utility of precise angular power spectrum measurements for identifying GWB origins as sensitivity improves.

Abstract: In recent years, several pulsar timing array collaborations have reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB). Such a background signal could be produced by supermassive binary black holes, early-Universe processes such as inflation and phase transitions, or a mixture of both. One way to disentangle different contributions to the GWB is to search for anisotropic signatures. In this work, we search for anisotropy in the GWB using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Our analysis employs both the radiometer method and the spherical harmonic basis to characterize the distribution of GWB power across the sky. We calculate the angular power in the lowest five frequency bins and compare it with detection thresholds determined under the null hypothesis of isotropy. In the 5.26 nHz frequency bin, we identify a hotspot in the reconstructed sky map with a $p$-value of $0.016$ (the lowest in our analysis), which we attribute to noise fluctuations. While our search reveals no statistically significant anisotropy, we expect that the precise measurement of angular power spectrum of the GWB will become instrumental in determining the origin of the nanohertz GWB signal.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The variability of NGC 4593's X-ray emissions reveals changes in the disc-corona geometry during flux transitions, showing coronal size doubles when flux increases from low to high states through reverberation delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the disc-corona geometry in Seyfert galaxies by analyzing X-ray reverberation variability beyond traditional flux-averaged methods.

Method: Used two long XMM observations (65 ksec each) with 2.5x flux difference. Extracted mean spectra, covariance spectra, and time-lag spectra. Modeled all spectra consistently, comparing low vs. high flux states.

Result: During low flux, direct continuum dominates at all frequencies; high flux shows reflection dominance. Time-lag analysis found reverberation delay increased from <96s (low) to 483±135s (high), indicating coronal expansion from <3.3 Rg to >7.2 Rg.

Conclusion: X-ray reverberation delays directly link flux changes to coronal geometry variations, showing coronal size scales with luminosity in NGC 4593.

Abstract: Understanding disc-corona geometry through X-ray reverberation variability studies in Seyfert galaxies is crucial, yet our knowledge mostly relies on flux-averaged mean spectral analysis. In this study, we investigate the origin of the large X-ray variability of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 using two \xmm{} observations, which are at least 65 ksec long and have a 0.3-10 keV X-ray flux difference by a factor of $\sim$2.5. We extracted mean spectra, Fourier-frequency resolved covariance, and time-lag spectra and performed modelling of all spectra in a self-consistent manner. From the best-fit covariance spectra, we have shown that energy-dependent covariance during low flux shows dominances of direct powerlaw continuum over reflection continuum at all Fourier frequencies (2.1 $-$ 390 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ Hz). However, during high flux, the variabilities are dominated by the reflection components most of the time. Our results are further supported by the Fourier frequency-dependent time-lag (between soft: 0.3-1 keV and hard: 1-5 keV bands) spectral modeling during high and low fluxes. A significant change is observed in the X-ray reverberation delay timescale from 483 $\pm$ 135 sec (during high flux) to $<$96 sec (during low flux), indicating a change in coronal size at least by a factor of $\sim$2 (from $<$3.3 R$_g$ to $>$7.2 R$_g$) during low to high flux transitions.

### [54] [Population synthesis predictions of the Galactic compact binary gravitational wave foreground detectable by LISA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11765)
*Jake McMillan,Adam Ingram,Cordelia Dashwood Brown,Andrei Igoshev,Matthew Middleton,Grzegorz Wiktorowicz,Simone Scaringi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper uses population synthesis modeling to predict gravitational wave (GW) signals from Galactic compact binaries detectable by LISA, showing detectability within 3 months and over 2000 individual detections possible. The study highlights the impact of common envelope efficiency (α) on GW signal characteristics and progenitor ratios, suggesting LISA could constrain α.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict the detectable GW signals from Galactic compact binaries for LISA, understand the role of astrophysical parameters like common envelope efficiency, and assess LISA's potential to constrain these parameters.

Method: Population synthesis modeling with realistic star formation history, metallicity dependence, supernova kick effects. Simulated binaries with WD, NS, or BH primaries. Calculated total GW strain power spectrum and individual detectable binaries. Varying common envelope efficiency (α) to study effects.

Result: GW signal detectable within 3 months; over 2000 individually detectable binaries in 4 years. Higher α increases the ratio of low chirp mass binaries (WD progenitors) to high chirp mass (NS/BH).

Conclusion: LISA can constrain common envelope efficiency through GW observations, addressing a key uncertainty in binary evolution models.

Abstract: We use population synthesis modelling to predict the gravitational wave (GW) signal that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect from the Galactic population of compact binary systems. We implement a realistic star formation history with time and position-dependent metallicity, and account for the effect of supernova kicks on present-day positions. We consider all binaries that have a white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), or black hole primary in the present-day. We predict that the summed GW signal from all Galactic binaries will already be detectable 3 months into the LISA mission, by measuring the power spectrum of the total GW strain. We provide a simple publicly available code to calculate such a power spectrum from a user-defined binary population. In the full 4 year baseline mission lifetime, we conservatively predict that $>2000$ binaries could be individually detectable as GW sources. We vary the assumed common envelope (CE) efficiency $α$, and find that it influences both the shape of the power spectrum and the relative number of detectable systems with WD and NS progenitors. In particular, the ratio of individually detectable binaries with chirp mass $\mathcal{M} < M_\odot$ to those with $\mathcal{M} \geqslant M_\odot$ increases with $α$. We therefore conclude that LISA may be able to diagnose the CE efficiency, which is currently poorly constrained.

### [55] [Impact of crust-core connection procedures on the tidal deformability of neutron stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11809)
*Junbo Pang,Hong Shen,Jinniu Hu*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines how different crust-core connection procedures in neutron star models affect tidal deformability, finding that while mass-radius relations remain stable, tidal deformability varies significantly (up to 20% for 1.4M⊙ stars) depending on the method used, with the direct approach being the most uncertain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of crust-core connection methods on neutron star properties, particularly tidal deformability, which is crucial for gravitational-wave observations.

Method: Three connection procedures were compared: direct, crossover, and segmented. Nonunified equation of state models around the crust-core transition were analyzed.

Result: Mass-radius relations were unaffected by connection procedures, but tidal deformability showed up to 20% variation for 1.4M⊙ stars. Direct connection produced largest uncertainties, while segmented and crossover methods were more stable.

Conclusion: Crust-core connection procedures significantly influence tidal deformability estimates, emphasizing the need for careful method selection when interpreting gravitational-wave data.

Abstract: We study the impact of crust-core connection procedures on various neutron-star properties, especially on the tidal deformability. We consider three types of connection procedures to treat the discontinuity in a nonunified equation of state around the crust-core transition: (1) the direct connection procedure, (2) the crossover connection procedure, and (3) the segmented method. Our results indicate that the mass-radius relations of neutron stars are almost unaffected by the details of the connection procedure. However, the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars are sensitive to the crust-core connection procedures. The tidal deformability is closely related to gravitational-wave measurements. For a canonical 1.4$M_\odot$ neutron star, uncertainties in the tidal deformability $Λ_{1.4}$ from different connection procedures can exceed 20\%. We find that the direct connection procedure yields significantly larger uncertainties in the tidal deformability, while the segmented method and crossover connection procedure provide relatively stable results.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are modulated by the Sun's magnetic field during their journey through the heliosphere, highlighting the effects of various solar phenomena on GCR flux, spectrum, and angular distribution up to ~30 GeV/nuc.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the solar-induced variations in GCR measurements and their dependence on particle energy, particularly how solar activity influences GCRs before they reach Earth.

Method: Review of studies on GCR variations caused by solar phenomena such as solar flares, coronal holes, sunspots, CMEs, and periodic solar cycles (diurnal, 27-day, 11-year, 22-year). Analysis of mechanisms like Forbush Decreases and gyro-radius constraints at ~100 AU.

Result: Solar modulation effects on GCRs are significant up to ~30 GeV/nuc beyond which the influence diminishes due to larger GCR gyro-radii exceeding heliosphere size (~100 AU). Periodic and transient solar events create distinct signatures in GCR data.

Conclusion: GCR variations provide a diagnostic tool for solar magnetic field dynamics and heliospheric structure, with diminishing solar influence at higher energies.

Abstract: Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) have to travel through the heliosphere before they interact with the Earth's atmosphere. During this, they are deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, causing variations in this field to imprint on the flux, spectrum and angular distribution of GCRs detected at or near Earth. Studies of these variations over the past several decades have revealed the impact of both transient phenomena such as solar flares, coronal holes, sunspot activity and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as well as their effects such as Forbush Decreases (FDs), precursors and Ground-Level Enhancements (GLEs). Periodic variations, such as due to the solar diurnal modulation, the 27-day solar rotation, the 11-year solar cycle, and the 22-year solar magnetic cycle have also been characterized. These Sun-induced phenomena are most prominent in GCR intensity variations up to $\sim$30 GeV/nuc, beyond which the influence of solar modulation decreases rapidly as the gyro-radii of GCRs exceed the characteristic size of the heliosphere ($\sim$100 AU).

### [57] [Spectro-timing origin of large amplitude X-ray variability in GRS 1915+105 using AstroSat/LAXPC and SXT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11876)
*Shree Suman,Shuvajit Khatua,Vishal Jadoliya,Prathamesh Narayan Gupta,Mayukh Pahari*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the origin of quasi-periodic X-ray variations in GRS 1915+105 using AstroSat data, finding that disc structural changes driven by radiation pressure, rather than coronal variations, cause the flux oscillations through cyclic evacuation and refilling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the origin of large-amplitude, quasi-periodic X-ray flux variations in GRS 1915+105's κ and ω classes, which remain unresolved despite previous studies.

Method: Performed flux-resolved broadband spectral modeling (0.8-20 keV) and covariance spectral analysis on four observations using AstroSat/SXT and LAXPC. Analyzed lightcurves, compared high/low flux spectral states, and measured energy-dependent variability contributions.

Result: High-flux phases show hot optically thick discs with steep Comptonization; low-flux phases show cooler/recessed discs and harder coronae. The disc temperature drops 1-2 keV with flux decreasing up to 5×. Variability originates almost entirely from disc variations, with minimal coronal contribution.

Conclusion: Radiation-pressure-driven cyclic disc evacuation/refilling explains the oscillations, with coronal response lagging disc changes. This explains the quasi-periodic behavior without requiring coronal instabilities.

Abstract: The origin of the large-amplitude, quasi-periodic X-ray flux variations in several classes of the Galactic microquasar GRS~1915+105 remains unresolved. We address this issue through flux-resolved, broadband (0.8-20 keV) spectral modelling and simultaneous covariance spectral analysis during two $κ$ and two $ω$ class observations using \textit{AstroSat}/SXT and LAXPC. The lightcurves show strong, quasi-periodic oscillations involving rapid transitions between bright bursts and deep dips on timescales of a few tens of seconds. Flux-resolved spectroscopy indicates that high-flux intervals in both classes are dominated by a hot, optically thick accretion disc with steep Comptonized emission, whereas low-flux intervals correspond to a cooler or partially recessed disc and a harder coronal continuum. These transitions involve a systematic 1-2 keV drop in disc temperature and a pronounced hardening of the Comptonized component, with flux reductions of up to a factor of five. Using covariance spectra across 0.015-5 Hz, we show that the rapid coherent variability arises almost entirely from the disc, which exhibits strong energy-dependent variations, while the Comptonized component contributes minimally. The combined results suggest that radiation-pressure-driven structural changes in the disc, with a slower coronal response, produce the observed oscillations, consistent with cyclic disc evacuation and refilling in the $κ$ and $ω$ classes.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Comprehensive ISS analysis of magnetar XTE~J1810$-$197 using six years of TMRT data at 7.0, 8.6, and 14.0~GHz, revealing scintillation properties, scattering screen location in Sagittarius Arm, and correlations with interstellar medium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the absence of pulse-to-pulse coherence at lower frequencies, determine scattering screen dynamics, and explore ISS characteristics of magnetars at higher frequencies to probe the interstellar medium.

Method: Multi-frequency (2018-2024) ISS monitoring with TMRT; analysis of scintillation parameters (Δν_d, Δτ_d, dt/dν); kinematic modeling to locate scattering screen; correlation analysis between arc asymmetry and dispersion measure gradients.

Result: Measured Δτ_d <4s at 575-725MHz (shorter than magnetar's 5.54s spin period), scattering screen located 1.6±0.1kpc in Sagittarius Arm near HII region, highest-frequency ISS arc detection at 14GHz with strong correlation to dispersion gradients, and DISS resolving scattering transition debate.

Conclusion: ISS studies of magnetars provide unique probes of interstellar medium structure in Sagittarius Arm, confirming scattering screen locations independent of magnetar outbursts, and extending frequency coverage for magnetar scintillation analysis.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive interstellar scintillation (ISS) study of the radio-loud magnetar XTE~J1810$-$197, based on six years of multi-frequency monitoring (2018$-$2024) with the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope (TMRT) at 7.0, 8.6, and 14.0~GHz. The scintillation parameters--decorrelation bandwidth $Δν_{\rm d}$, decorrelation time $Δτ_{\rm d}$, and drift rate $dt/dν$--are fully characterized. Our measured $Δτ_{\rm d}$ implies $Δτ_{\rm d} < 4$~s at 575-725~MHz under a Kolmogorov spectrum, which is shorter than the magnetar's 5.54~s spin period. This result naturally explains the previously reported absence of pulse-to-pulse coherence at these frequencies. Kinematic modeling locates the dominant scattering screen at $1.6\pm0.1$~kpc away from the Earth, within the Sagittarius Arm. The screen coincides with the HII region JCMTSE~J180921.2$-$201932 and is unrelated to the magnetar's 2018 outburst suggested by earlier studies. A scintillation arc detected at 14.0~GHz represents the highest-frequency arc observed to date. The asymmetry of arcs is linearly correlated with a dispersion-measure gradient across the screen ($r = 0.959$, $p < 10^{-8}$). We also measure its refractive scintillation timescale, which is only $1.21\pm0.19$~d. Clear DISS at 14~GHz effectively resolves the debate over a possible strong-to-weak scattering transition at this frequency. These results extend the ISS characterization of magnetars to previously unexplored frequencies and provide a precise probe of the ionized interstellar medium in the Sagittarius Arm.

*Keisi Kacanja,Kanchan Soni,Aleyna Akyuz,Alexander H. Nitz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents the first analysis of sub-solar mass compact binary searches using O4a LIGO data, setting merger rate limits and constraining primordial black hole contributions to dark matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The search aims to detect sub-solar mass neutron stars or primordial black holes, which cannot form via standard stellar evolution, potentially indicating new astrophysical phenomena or dark matter components.

Method: The study uses data from O4a with tidal effects included for low-mass neutron stars, covering primary masses 0.1-2 solar masses and secondary 0.1-1 solar masses. It analyzed merger rates and tidal deformabilities.

Result: No candidates found. Improved sub-solar BH merger rate upper limit to <1.77e4 Gpc⁻³yr⁻¹ at 90% confidence. Placed first constraints on tidal deformabilities up to 7e5 and constrained PBH dark matter fraction <2%.

Conclusion: Results expand observational limits for sub-solar binaries and restrict possible non-standard formation channels for compact objects, weakening some dark matter PBH hypotheses.

Abstract: We report the first results of a sub-solar mass compact binary search using the data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) of the Advanced LIGO detectors. Sub-solar mass neutron stars or primordial black holes are not expected to form via standard stellar evolution, and their observation would signify a new class of astrophysical object or the discovery of dark matter. Our search covers binaries with primary masses 0.1 to 2 $\textrm{M}_\odot$ and secondary masses 0.1 to 1 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. We explicitly incorporate tidal effects up to $7\times10^5$ for extremely low mass neutron stars. No statistically significant candidates are identified. The advanced sensitivity of the O4a run enables an improvement in the sub-solar mass black hole merger rate limits by more than $2 \times$ over the previous three observing runs (O1-O3b). We place a $90\%$ confidence upper limit on the merger rate $\mathcal{R}_{90}$ for sub-solar mass black holes to be $< 1.77\times10^4 \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. We place the first constraints for binary neutron stars with tidal deformabilities up to $\sim 7\times10^5$ and improve the merger rate estimate by a factor $\sim 4$ in comparison to previous O3 tidal searches for tidal deformabilities $< 10^4$. We further constrain the fraction of dark matter composed of primordial black hole $f_{\rm PBH}< 2\%$ for a chirp mass of 0.1 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. Our results significantly expand the observational search space for sub-solar binaries and provide rigorous constraints on the local abundance of compact objects that may arise from non-standard formation mechanisms.

*Malihe Mousapour Gharghabi,Jamshid Ghanbari,Mahboobe Moeen Moghaddas*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents a semi-analytical general relativistic framework incorporating rotational shear to study magnetic field amplification in black hole accretion flows, showing how rotation and compressional effects differentially enhance radial and azimuthal field components under various flow regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how magnetic field amplification in accretion disks around black holes drives high-energy phenomena like jets and magnetically arrested disks (MADs), extending classical models which neglect rotation's role.

Method: Develop a semi-analytical general relativistic model by combining compressional amplification with rotational shear effects in a Schwarzschild spacetime. Parameterize azimuthal velocity parameter ξ (0 to 1, covering radial to Keplerian flows) to analyze how rotational support influences poloidal field evolution across subsonic/supersonic flow transitions.

Result: 1. Pure radial inflow (ξ=0) maximizes B_r and B_θ amplification through compression. 2. Sub-Keplerian (ξ<1) flows enhance B_r more than B_θ. 3. Keplerian rotation (ξ=1) boosts B_θ via shear. 4. Transition to supersonic inner regions accelerates magnetic growth. 5. Sub-Keplerian phases favor radial flux advection needed for MAD formation.

Conclusion: Rotational velocity critically controls both magnetic amplification efficiency and geometry. The model connects classical theory with GRMHD simulations, offering insights for understanding astrophysical systems like X-ray binaries and AGNs observed at EHT scales.

Abstract: The amplification of magnetic fields in black hole accretion flows governs key high-energy phenomena such as magnetically arrested disks and relativistic jets. We develop a semi-analytical general relativistic framework that extends classical compressional amplification models by incorporating rotational shear, and apply it to large-scale poloidal magnetic field evolution in accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. By parameterizing the azimuthal velocity as a fraction of the Keplerian value ($ξ\in [0,1]$), from purely radial infall ($ξ=0$) to Keplerian rotation ($ξ=1$), we examine the combined effects of radial compression and shear. Purely radial flows maximize amplification of both $B_r$ and $B_θ$ due to strong compression. In rotating flows, a distinct dichotomy emerges: sub-Keplerian regimes ($ξ<1$) preferentially enhance $B_r$, whereas Keplerian rotation strengthens $B_θ$ via shear. The transition from subsonic outer regions to supersonic relativistic inner regions further accelerates magnetic growth, revealing effects absent in earlier analytical treatments. These results show that rotational support controls both amplification efficiency and magnetic geometry, with sub-Keplerian phases particularly favorable for advecting the radial flux required for MAD formation. This work provides an analytical bridge between classical accretion theory and modern GRMHD simulations, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGNs, and EHT-scale systems.

### [61] [A simple model for extracting astrophysics from black hole images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12195)
*Alexandra G. Guerrero,Daniel E. Holz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses EHT images of M87* to constrain the black hole mass and accretion disk properties, finding that the accretion disk extends near the horizon but rules out the innermost stable orbit for a non-rotating black hole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to exploit EHT's high-resolution images to simultaneously determine the mass of M87* and understand the accretion disk's inner edge, addressing uncertainties in black hole astrophysics using image parameters.

Method: The team developed a simple model linking accretion disk intensity profiles to observational features. They applied it to both the original EHT M87* image and the PRIMO reanalyzed image, incorporating brightness asymmetry data.

Result: Using two datasets, they constrained the black hole mass to ~6.4-6.6 billion solar masses and found the accretion disk inner edge between 3M-5.3M or extending to the horizon. Results exclude the Schwarzschild innermost stable orbit and horizon-touching emission for PRIMO.

Conclusion: EHT images can constrain black hole mass and accretion physics without resolving the photon ring. The accretion disk terminates closer than classical orbits, implying potentials roles for black hole spin or relativistic effects. Future higher-resolution data would refine these estimates.

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is providing unprecedented high-resolution images of supermassive black holes. These images are fundamentally related to properties of the luminous accretion disks, since black holes themselves produce no light. We develop a simple prescription to relate observational features of black hole images to a toy model for the intensity profile of the associated accretion disk. We apply our model to the original EHT image of M87*, as well as to the reanalyzed image from the PRIMO algorithm, providing generic, simultaneous constraints on the mass of the black hole and properties of the accretion disk emission. While current images lack the resolution to confidently detect the photon ring, the consideration of multiple image parameters are found to contain enough information to provide constraints on the inner edge of the accretion disk along with the black hole mass. Using observed features of the original EHT image, we constrain the mass of M87* to be $6.6^{+1.2}_{-1.0}\times 10^9 M_\odot$ to 68$\%$ confidence, and find that emission may extend all the way to the black hole horizon. When instead using constraints from the PRIMO algorithm's image along with constraints on the brightness asymmetry provided by the original EHT analysis, we find M87*'s mass to be $ 6.4^{+0.7}_{-0.7}\times 10^9 M_\odot$ to 68$\%$ confidence, with the inner edge of the accretion disk between $3M$ and $5.3M$. Both analyses rule out an inner edge of the accretion disk coinciding with the innermost stable circular orbit for a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the narrow ring width reported in the PRIMO image also confidently rules out emission increasing all the way down to the black hole horizon. Further assumptions on the mass of M87* and connections between the accretion disk cutoff and physical radii allow for rudimentary black hole spin estimates.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of the TDE AT2024tvd's late-time SED supports its classification as a supermassive black hole with an extreme black hole-to-host mass ratio, indicating it may be a wandering black hole stripped of its host galaxy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nature of the off-nuclear TDE AT2024tvd, its energy distribution, and its implications for black hole demographics and cosmological predictions.

Method: Used X-ray and UV/optical data in a relativistic accretion disk model with Comptonization to fit the SED and infer black hole mass and disk parameters, then compared with scaling relations and host galaxy observations.

Result: Confirmed a supermassive black hole mass (~10^6 solar masses), no detectable host galaxy down to log(10^7.6 solar masses), and an extreme mass ratio (>3%), suggesting it is a wandering black hole stripped of its host.

Conclusion: The study aligns with simulations that wandering black holes lose detectable hosts. The modeling approach provides reliable parameters and challenges previous interpretations by emphasizing a physically consistent solution.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2024tvd during its late-time plateau phase, combining X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry. Using a fully relativistic, compact accretion disk model with self-consistent inner-disk Comptonization, we reproduce the observed SED without significant residuals. The inferred black hole mass ${\rm log}{10}(M{\bullet}/M_\odot) \approx 6.0 \pm 0.2$, and the inferred disk parameters place AT2024tvd within known TDE-disk scaling relations ($L_{\rm bol}^{\rm disk}/L_{\rm Edd} \propto T_{\rm p}^4 \propto M_{\bullet}^{-1}$, $L_{\rm plat} \propto M_{\bullet}^{2/3}$, $R_{\rm out}/r_{\rm g} \propto M_{\bullet}^{-2/3}$). Our results show that: (i) there is no \textit{detected} star cluster or dwarf galaxy associated with the source, down to a mass limit of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm gal}/M_{\odot}) \leq 7.6$; (ii) the black hole is a wandering supermassive, rather than intermediate-mass, black hole; and (iii) the source represents an extreme case of black hole-to-host mass ratio, with $M_{\bullet}/M_{\rm gal} > 3\%$, consistent with a heavily tidally stripped nucleus. The latter aligns with cosmological simulations predicting that surviving host remnants of most wandering black holes should not retain a detectable stellar overdensity when located at small halo-centric distances. We discuss differences with previous analyses of this source and highlight why our modeling approach provides a more physically consistent solution with more reliable parameter inference.

### [63] [Ubiquitous yet forgotten: broad absorptions in the optical spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12282)
*D. Mata Sanchez,T. Munoz-Darias,J. Casares,M. A. P. Torres,M. Armas Padilla*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents the first population study of broad absorptions in the optical spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) during outbursts, finding these features are common in black hole LMXBs, particularly in systems with orbital periods under 11 hours. The absorptions align with a disc-based origin, anti-correlating with luminosity and showing stable line ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the under-studied phenomenon of broad absorptions in optical spectra of LMXBs, understand their fundamental properties, and contextualize their origin within accretion/ejection processes.

Method: Constructed a spectroscopic database of six LMXBs during outbursts, analyzing their evolution and properties of broad absorptions across different X-ray states and system parameters.

Result: Broad absorptions are ubiquitous in black hole LMXBs, independent of inclination or compact object type but favoring short orbital periods (<11h). They occur in Balmer series, stronger at shorter wavelengths, with depth anti-correlated to luminosity and consistent line ratios. Support a disc origin beneath a chromospheric emission region.

Conclusion: Broad absorptions likely originate from a stable, optically thick accretion disc layer. Their visibility is affected by emission line filling and veiling by X-ray reprocessed continuum, suggesting continuous presence during outbursts despite variable detection.

Abstract: Optical outburst spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries enable studies of extreme accretion and ejection phenomena. While some of their spectroscopic features have been analysed in detail, the appearance of broad absorptions in the optical regime has been traditionally neglected. In this work, we introduce the first population study dedicated to these features with the aim to understand their fundamental properties and discuss them in the context of their origin. We complement the study with a spectroscopic database of six low-mass X-ray binaries during outburst, in order to assess their evolution. We find that broad absorptions are ubiquitous, with the majority of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries exhibiting them in spite of a typically scarce outburst coverage. Their detection does not depend on the orbital inclination or the compact object nature, but they seem favoured in systems with orbital periods shorter than < 11 h. They predominantly occur in the hydrogen Balmer series, being stronger at shorter wavelengths, and they are detected across all X-ray states. We find that the normalised depth of these broad absorptions is anti-correlated with the system luminosity, and that they show constant line ratios over the whole sample. Based on these properties, we favour a scenario where BAs arise from a stable, optically thick layer of the accretion disc, below the hotter chromosphere-like region producing the emission line components. Our study is consistent with the continuous presence of broad absorptions during the whole outburst, with their visibility being conditioned by the emission lines filling the broad absorption profile and veiling by the X-ray reprocessed continuum.
