Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky\nTransient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of\ntransients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims.\nWe investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous\nsupernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \\sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the\nlower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in\na faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \\simeq -14.5$ AB.\nMethods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and\nimaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the\ndata are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons\nwith other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN\n2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The\nbolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5\nx10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy\nmodeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a\nSLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling\nshows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive\nsource ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve\nevolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the\nexplosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\\rm ej} \\sim 0.24 ~M_\\odot$) took place in a\nlow mass ($M \\sim 10^{6.66}~M_\\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation\nrate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions.\nGiven its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its\nlight-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe\nTypes. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu\nand SN 2018gep.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
