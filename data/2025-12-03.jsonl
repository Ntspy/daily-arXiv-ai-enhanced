We find that the optimal frequency range for achieving cyclic deconvolution for most pulsars is between $\\sim$80$-$300 MHz, making low frequency observatories like uGMRT, LOFAR, and MWA the best-suited instruments for the technique. Moreover, we find that, as quantified by the total number sources with sufficient cyclic merits that are observed within the full deconvolution regime, uGMRT is likely the best current instrument for cyclic spectroscopy among the nine telescopes we considered, with LOFAR being the second best, and future telescopes like SKA-Low serving as the most likely eventual successors. The relatively high cyclic merit of the Crab Pulsar in the frequency ranges considered for GBT, MWA, LOFAR, and uGMRT suggests that some faster-spinning canonical pulsars may be able to achieve cyclic deconvolution, and we discuss potential follow-up analyses on other non-recycled pulsars. We conclude by advocating for near real-time cyclic spectroscopy backends to be considered for current and upcoming low frequency telescopes to increase the accessibility of this technique."}

Pushing into the sub-0.1mm regime is required to probe ultra-slow tidal dissipation, long-period librations, uHz-band gravitational waves. We develop a complete amplitude-modulated continuous-wave (AM-CW) framework for high-power LLR, including measurement models, estimators, a unified covariance description, and an observatory CONOPS. CW LLR is treated as RF phase metrology on a bright CW optical carrier: 2-way range and 1-way line-of-sight range-rate obtained from the phase and phase slope of a GHz-class modulation tone. The joint estimators are characterized by a covariance matrix decomposed into photon, atmospheric, instrumental, oscillator, nonlinearity contributions, mapped into subsystem requirements, including a closed-form range-rate bias from modulation-frequency slew across the ~2.56s round trip and synthetic-wavelength constraints on multi-tone nonlinearity. Using realistic photon budgets for a 1 kW, 1064 nm CW transmitter on a 1-m telescope ranging to 10cm corner-cube retroreflectors, we show that the photon-statistical floor for 2-way range at a GHz-class modulation frequency is at the level of a few-10 um in ~100s. With allocations to residual atmosphere and instrument, the resulting single-station 2-way precision is ~80 um, with range-rate sensitivities of ~0.1-1 um/s. Differential LLR between reflectors separated on the Moon by ~1000km can deliver 20-50 um and few (0.1-1) um/s differential range and range-rate. These precisions are realized across three representative regimes that span detected photon rates of (5-7) x 10^3-10^5 s^{-1} and are translated directly into hardware and CONOPS requirements for next-generation high-power AM-CW LLR."}

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories."}

In this work, we conduct the first search for high-energy neutrino emission from a new source class, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are also theoretically motivated. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis on our constructed catalog of 693 SMBHB candidates and 10 years of IceCube public data. Our results show positive correlations, with higher significance in more physically motivated scenarios and the highest significance at 3.0$σ$. In addition, we also study potential connections between SMBHBs' high-energy neutrino and nano-Hz gravitational-wave emissions, the latter being the main target of pulsar timing arrays. Our results provide the first evidence of SMBHBs being high-energy neutrino emitters."}

Employing a phenomenological environmental black-hole model with the hyperboloidal framework, we identify near-coalescence of both QNM eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, and directly demonstrate that the resonance produces enhanced mode contributions in the time domain, resulting in characteristic departures from exponentially damped oscillations. Our formulation further reveals that the EP frequency, given by the averaged value of the resonant modes, emerges as the physically relevant observable in the near-EP regime, and offers a robust foundation for modeling and extracting resonant ringdown signals."}

Because the plasma in the jet-launching region is accelerated to relativistic velocities, and because the jet in M87 is nearly aligned with the line of sight (offset by ~17 degrees), a slow-light treatment is important for accurately modeling the observable structure. While fast-light images exhibit prominent helical or loop-shaped features in the jet - which we associate with narrow bundles of magnetic field lines - these features become stretched and smoothed-out in slow-light images. Our slow-light images instead exhibit a double-edged, cone-like morphology that is more consistent with observations of M87 than corresponding fast-light images. We find that the radius at which the plasma transitions from sub-relativistic to relativistic velocities is imprinted on slow-light images via a transition from loop-dominated at small distances from the black hole to edge-dominated at a larger distance, with the loop-edge transition occurring at larger distances for lower black hole spins. The jet image dynamics also vary with black hole spin, with low-spin models producing jets that exhibit substantial \"wobbling\", while high-spin models produce jets that are straighter and more stable in time. The spin-dependent jet morphology and variability are revealed by slow-light imaging because slow-light effects become more enhanced as the plasma velocity becomes more relativistic, and because the plasma acceleration is itself a strong function of the spin."}

Unlike standard SANE/MAD setups that impose a coherent large-scale poloidal loop, our \"sub-SANE\" initial conditions use multiple same-polarity small-scale magnetic loops. Rapid reconnection erases magnetic memory and enables large-scale dynamo to emerge early from MRI turbulence. We perform two such sub-SANE simulations at different BH spins ($a = 0.5, 0.9375$) and compare them with conventional SANE runs. The sub-SANE disks show regular large-scale dynamo cycles with periods of about ten orbits. Decomposition of the induction equation shows that the turbulent dynamo term is stronger in 3D compared to 2.5D and balances advection in the saturated state, confirming sustained large-scale field generation. These dynamo-generated fields are advected inward with minimal time lag, producing correlated peaks in both poloidal and toroidal field strengths from $r_{\\rm max}$ to the horizon. Early in the evolution, these peaks imprint directly onto the jet's electromagnetic energy flux, indicating that the jet mirrors the dynamo wave. Though jets form at early times, the sub-SANE runs eventually undergo jet shutdown. We show that this occurs when the magnetic field at the horizon loses coherence, as quantified by a decline in the signed-to-unsigned flux ratio $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm BH}$ below $\\approx 0.6$. In contrast, the SANE reference case with similar accretion rate and horizon magnetic flux maintains high magnetic coherence because its initial large-scale field persists, allowing its jet to survive. Our results show that both dynamo-driven field evolution and horizon magnetic-field coherence critically regulate jet longevity, establishing a direct dynamo-jet connection in GRMHD disks."}

TDEs have also enabled the discovery of a few Massive Black Holes (MBHs) with inferred masses of $10^4$--$10^6\\,M_\\odot$, often associated with the nuclei of dwarf galaxies or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Here we present AT2022zod, an extreme and short-lived optical flare in an elliptical galaxy at z=0.11, residing within 3kpc of the galaxy's centre. Its luminosity and ~30-day duration make it unlikely to have originated from the host galaxy's central supermassive black hole (SMBH), which estimate to have a mass around $10^8\\,M_\\odot$. Assuming that the emission mechanism is consistent with known observed TDEs, we find that such a rapidly evolving transient could either be produced by a MBH in the intermediate-mass range or, alternatively, result from the tidal disruption of a star on a non-parabolic orbit around the central SMBH. We suggest that the most plausible origin for AT2022zod is the tidal disruption of a star by a MBH embedded in a UCD. As the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time comes online, we propose that AT2022zod serves as an important event for refining search strategies and characterization techniques for intermediate-mass black holes."}

Inelastic channels generate anti-Hermitian contributions that can be consistently deduced from the unitarity relation underlying the optical theorem, leading to non-local separable potentials and a compact unitarization scheme in the non-relativistic regime. We present two alternative derivations of the anti-Hermitian kernel, from the continuity equation and by integrating out inelastic channels. We further extend this framework to treat non-analytic and non-convergent behavior of inelastic amplitudes in the complex momentum plane and to incorporate bound states. For non-convergent amplitudes, we demonstrate a simple renormalization procedure in which anti-Hermitian separable potentials necessarily induce Hermitian separable counterterms, yielding finite cross sections consistent with unitarity.

However, its light curves deviate substantially from previous theoretical expectations. Motivated by these unique features, we have developed a novel model that successfully reproduces its peculiar evolution. Our model delineates five stages: (1) Initial Stage of inefficient circularization; (2) Slow-Rising Stage with a faint X-ray precursor disk fed by successive self-crossings; (3) Fast-Rising Stage, where delayed stream-disk interaction at momentum flux matching drives a sharp luminosity rise; (4) Plateau Stage with super-Eddington accretion, outflow, reprocessing, and a clear polar line-of-sight; and (5) Decline Stage of sub-Eddington accretion and ongoing reprocessing. Our fit indicates the disruption of a $M_* \\approx 0.4~M_\\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star with a penetration factor $β\\approx 1.0$. Our model, which incorporates key TDE processes, establishes EP240222a-like light curves as typical IMBH-TDE signatures.

The study highlights how the pressure anisotropy, the propagation speeds of sound, and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff balance condition are interconnected, showing that the star remains in mechanical equilibrium only when the gravitational, hydrostatic, electric, and anisotropic contributions counterbalance one another appropriately. The dynamical stability of the configuration is further supported by the requirement $Γ> \\tfrac{4}{3}$ for the adiabatic index, indicating resilience against small radial perturbations.

Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations."}

We investigate how well a non-SM value of $λ_{hhh}$ can be determined indirectly via its loop contributions within a global EFT fit. Using an inert doublet extension of the SM Higgs sector as an example for a scenario of physics beyond the SM that could be realised in nature, we find that theoretical uncertainties related to the treatment of loop contributions and the truncation of the EFT expansion, which are usually neglected, play an important role in determining the sensitivity to $λ_{hhh}$ in a global fit. The results obtained from such an indirect determination of $λ_{hhh}$ without taking these additional uncertainties into account would be too optimistic, leading to an artificially high resulting precision for $λ_{hhh}$.

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \\approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime.

We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources. Next-generation detectors should enable the detection of multiple BNS subpopulations and their redshift evolution, providing valuable insight into their formation pathways."}

We delineate the theoretical constraints on the model, requiring the scalar potential to be bounded from below in all field directions, ensuring perturbative unitarity of scattering amplitudes, and demanding that the electroweak vacuum corresponds to the global minimum of the potential. We find that the electroweak vacuum is not generically guaranteed to be the global minimum: several charge-breaking stationary points may coexist with -- and potentially lie below -- it in potential depth. For the electroweak-like vacuum with vanishing quadruplet expectation value, the condition of global stability reduces to two simple mass inequalities involving the doubly- and triply-charged scalars. In contrast, for the general electroweak vacuum with nonzero doublet and quadruplet expectation values -- compatible with neutrino-mass generation -- no comparably simple analytic condition emerges, and the stability must be assessed for each specific choice of scalar couplings. Nonetheless, by combining the analytic condition governing the relative depth of the two electroweak stationary points with the mass inequalities ensuring the stability of the electroweak-like configuration against charge breaking, we obtain a practical criterion for determining when the general electroweak vacuum is globally stable."}

Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence."}

Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024)013], (a) We obtain a formula for the deflection angle of bound massive particles in SAS spacetimes by dividing bound orbits that azimuthally overlap with themselves into multiple non-overlapping segments. This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles."}

We use dimensional reduction techniques to obtain the finite-temperature effective potential and study the possible first-order phase transitions. We match these transitions to steady-state hydrodynamical solutions in order to determine the corresponding gravitational-wave spectra.

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories."}

In the cosmological setup, this leads to correction to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the Universe. In this paper, we investigate the implications of zero-point length $l_0$-corrected gravity for gravitational baryogenesis and early universe thermodynamics, deriving constraints on $l_0$ from observational baryon asymmetry data. We observe that under the condition of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, $l_0$ generates $\\dot{\\mathcal{R}}\\neq 0$ during radiation epoch, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar. This yields a baryon asymmetry parameter $η\\propto l_0^2 T_D^9/M_{\\rm Pl}^7$.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the zero-point length correction in the Friedmann equation, effectively slows the expansion rate at high energies, resulting in a modified time-temperature relationship where the Universe maintains higher temperatures for longer time during early epochs compared to standard cosmology. Our results establish zero-point length cosmology as a testable framework connecting quantum gravity to cosmological observables, with implications for early universe thermal history and fundamental length scales."}

This finding contradicts the conventional expectation that a heavier exchanged mass in the interaction implies suppressed relativistic effects.

Stars and dust in galaxies are expected to be the main source of the EBL. However, recent direct measurements performed beyond Pluto's orbit (less affected by foregrounds than those performed from the Earth) hint at an EBL level in the optical band larger than the one expected from the integrated contribution of known galaxy populations. One approach that could solve this controversy uses Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. These photons can interact with the EBL producing electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint on the observed VHE spectrum. This technique, however, requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can compromise the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, we used Monte Carlo simulations and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes to study the impact that the assumptions adopted in the literature have on the estimate of the EBL density, and how using more generic ones would modify the results. Our results show how the EBL density constraints obtained highly depend on the intrinsic spectral shape assumed for the source. We have studied two different methods to reduce the assumptions on the intrinsic spectral shape to get more robust results. This will be especially important for upcoming with new VHE facilities, where systematic uncertainties are expected to play a more significant role compared to statistical ones."}

It unifies Dyson-Schwinger dynamics of quark propagation, functional renormalization-group evolution of the scale-dependent effective action, and Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio thermodynamics for chiral and deconfinement order parameters. It also includes a holographic Maxwell-Chern-Simons sector that supplies baryonic and topological response within a single, renormalization group consistent framework. Within this construction the axial-anomaly channel is evolved rather than tuned. The holographic topological susceptibility feeds directly into the flow of the determinantal interaction. As a result, anomaly-induced flavor mixing weakens as deconfinement sets in. This behavior drives the chiral condensate and the Polyakov loop toward a self-dual fixed point. At this point their renormalizations coincide, their residual mixing vanishes, and a unified order parameter controls criticality. The theory is anchored to continuum-extrapolated lattice thermodynamics and conserved-charge fluctuations at vanishing baryon density. This anchoring is implemented through a lattice-calibrated Polyakov sector. The framework respects exact thermodynamic identities by enforcing stationarity at each scale. It also recovers the ideal-gas limit at high temperature and the Goldstone limit at low temperature. Solving the coupled Dyson-Schwinger, renormalization-group, and holographic equations yields the critical end point as an output rather than an assumption. The critical end point appears at temperatures around one hundred forty megaelectronvolts and baryon chemical potentials of a few hundred megaelectronvolts. The theory predicts a small positive curvature of the crossover line near zero density."}

Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations."}

Medium-induced radiation effects, implemented in leading-order direct and fragmentation photon processes, are computed for pPb collisions at the LHC. At backward rapidity, photons are sensitive to fully coherent energy loss (FCEL), while at forward rapidity, fully coherent energy gain (FCEG) plays a crucial role due to the dominance of the $qg \\to qγ$ scattering channel. In contrast, for virtual photon production, the impact of fully coherent radiation is marginal, making Drell-Yan (DY) one of the best ways to probe nuclear PDFs.

The detection of GW190425 by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) suggests a subpopulation of massive BNSs, possibly formed through unstable \"case BB\" mass transfer with short merger delays. We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources. Next-generation detectors should enable the detection of multiple BNS subpopulations and their redshift evolution, providing valuable insight into their formation pathways."}

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \\approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime.

Most famously, Yang made transformative contributions to the current Standard Model of elementary particle interactions. The proposal of Yang and T. D. Lee, that left-right symetry (parity) is violated in weak particle decays, established that the primary currents involved in weak interactions are left handed. The work of Yang and R. L. Mills gave a framework for force carriers coupling to these currents that are non-Abelian generalizations of the electromagnetic photon, which unlike the electrically neutral photon, carry ``charges'' to which they self-couple . Two decades of work by others on quantization and mass-generation mechanisms then culminated in the Standard Model."}

We systematically classify all these processes that change lepton flavor by one unit and formulate their decay widths in terms of the dim-6 LEFT Wilson coefficients. By applying constraints on these Wilson coefficients derived from current experimental limits on BNV two-body nucleon decays, we obtain stringent and robust bounds on the rates of these triple-lepton modes. These bounds vary significantly from one dim-6 operator to another under consideration. Our results for the $Δ(B-L)=0$ modes differ by several orders of magnitude from previous phase-space estimates in the literature, thereby providing a more reliable assessment of their potential occurrence. In addition, we provide improved bounds on $Δ(B+L)=0$ modes compared to the existing experimental limits."}

Next I discuss the status of the theory predictions of the various $N$ decay rates. In scenarios in which $N$ interacts with SM particles only through sterile-active neutrino mixing, the dependence of the lifetime on the relevant mixing angles is important to determine whether $N$ decays in the detector or outside. To calculate the inclusive decay rate into semi-hadronic final states reliably one needs to include radiative QCD corrections.

Starting from a broad U(1)'_ell extension in which leptons carry family-dependent charges (q_e, q_mu, q_tau) while quarks remain neutral, quantum consistency is ensured through a minimal set of vectorlike leptons, chiral under U(1)'_ell but vectorlike under the SM, together with singlet scalars responsible for symmetry breaking and the masses of both Z_ell and the heavy leptons. In the heavy-mediator limit, we integrate out Z_ell at tree level and derive compact, analytic SMEFT Wilson coefficients for four-lepton operators and Higgs-current structures, including hypercharge-U(1)'_ell kinetic mixing proportional to Tr(Y Q'). Renormalization-group evolution down to the electroweak scale and matching onto LEFT produce closed-form expressions directly applicable to e+e- -> l+l-, neutrino trident production, nu e scattering, parity-violating Moeller observables, and muon-decay parameters. A single parameter combination, Lambda_eff = M_Zell / (g_ell * sqrt(|q q'|)), governs all leading EFT signatures, offering a unified way to map UV charge assignments onto precision observables.

The models incorporate energy-dependent exponential slopes, power-law prefactors, and localized Gaussian modifications which are built to reproduce the observed dip region, supplemented in some cases by logarithmic $t$-dependent slopes. Simple additive sub-leading exponential contributions that represent charge conjugation and isospin roles are introduced in the models to increase applicability and quality of fit across elastic differential cross section data of $np$, $n\\bar{p}$, $pp$, and $p\\bar{p}$ elastic scattering. The models reproduce the characteristic features of the elastic scattering data such as the dip-bump structure, shrinkage of the forward peak, and controlled curvature that is localized around the dip. Parameters of the models are found by fitting the experimental data of elastic $np$ differential cross section in an energy range of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 3.36 GeV to 26.02 GeV, across a momentum range of $0.065 \\leq \\mid t\\mid \\leq 5.341 \\textrm{GeV}^{2}$. The parameter values and their ranges, obtained by $χ^{2}$ minimization are found within their assumed expected bounds with the $np$ data fitting. The total cross section, the slope parameter, the interaction radius, the total elastic cross section, the inelastic cross section, the ratios $σ_{el}/σ_{tot}$, and $σ_{inel}/σ_{tot}$ are predicted by the models for the $np$ scattering at all the energies, which show accurate quantitative agreement with their reference values. The results show that the proposed models not only provide accurate quantitative description of $np$ elastic differential cross section but also yield estimates of the observables that are consistent with theoretical expectations from Regge phenomenology and high-energy scattering constraints."}

These clear signs of BSM physics motivate extensions introducing new particles and symmetries. Theoretical questions like the flavor puzzle and the strong CP problem further guide BSM frameworks. This thesis explores BSM scenarios based on two guiding principles: constructing unified frameworks that address multiple open problems in (astro)particle physics and cosmology, and emphasizing their experimental testability through detailed phenomenological analyses. This approach uncovers deep connections between seemingly disconnected sectors, offering a more complete view of fundamental physics. We investigate dark sector models for the origin of neutrino masses, proposing a novel setup: dark linear seesaw, which radiatively links neutrino mass generation to DM candidates and predicts charged lepton flavor violation. In these scenarios, dark sector particles can constitute WIMP DM, testable via direct detection experiments. We study spontaneous CP violation induced by a complex scalar singlet, acting as a common origin of low- and high-energy CP violating effects relevant for leptogenesis. We also analyze a Nelson-Barr model that solves the strong CP problem, generates a realistic CKM matrix radiatively, and yields scalar WIMP DM. Additionally, we present unified axion frameworks in which a colored sector radiatively generates neutrino masses. These models predict distinctive axion couplings to photons and fermions and accommodate axion DM in both pre- and post-inflationary cosmologies. Finally, we explore minimal flavored Peccei-Quinn symmetries that link the flavor puzzle, neutrino masses and DM within a predictive and testable framework."}

For the core of the halo, the dark matter fermions are degenerate, while for the halo we have considered two possibilities: the fermions have thermalized as a perfect fluidor they will follow a standard cold dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White profile. The core density profile is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and their properties are determined by the fermion mass, the central density and the interaction strength. The mass of the fermion and the strength of the fermion self-interaction is fixed by doing a $χ^2$ analysis to fit that fit the rotational curves of Low Surface Brightness galaxies. It was found that the fermion mass should be in the range $38.73~\\rm{eV}< m_{f} < 42.11~\\rm{eV}$ and the interparticle strength in the range $269.69 < y <348.48$ at $68$ C.L. in order to reproduce the rotational curves adequately, in the case when the halo is modeled as a thermalized ideal gas. Similar values are obtained if the halo is modeled following a Navarro-Frenk-White case, namely $41.54 ~\\rm{eV} < m_{f} <49.87 ~\\rm{eV}$ and $5606.06< y < 17484.84$. Once fixed the values of the mass of the fermion $m_f$ and the interaction strength $y$, we tested the core-halo model with data from the Milky Way and the SPARC database. We have found good agreement between the data and the core-halo models, varying only one free parameter: the central density. Thus a single fermion can fit hundreds of galaxies. Nevertheless, the dark matter halo surface density relation or the halo total mass and radius depend strongly on the model for the halo."}

The electromagnetic transitions are calculated from the ground and $P$-wave states to ground states, as well as from the second shell states to both the ground and $P$-wave final states. These decays play a crucial role in confirming the existence of certain resonances when strong decays are not allowed. %A relevant case is the $Ω_c^{0}$ spin excitation with $\\bf J^P ={\\frac{3}{2}}^{+}$ denoted as $Ω_c^{*0}$. This state cannot decay strongly, but has a nonvanishing predicted electromagnetic decay width in the $Ω_c^{0} γ$ channel. The $Ω_c^{*0}$ was precisely observed in this channel. Moreover, electromagnetic decay widths are particularly useful for identifying resonances when states have the same mass and total decay width. A relevant case is the $Ω_c (3327)$ state, whose branching ratios between the strong decay channels are comparable; thus, the radiative decay widths may help assign this state. We also make the assignment of the recently discovered $Ξ'_c(2923)^{+}$ baryon, which is consistent with being the isospin partner of the $Ξ'_c(2923)^{0}$. This study presents, for the first time, the calculation of electromagnetic decays for $D_ρ$-wave states, $ρ-λ$ mixed states, and $ρ$-mode radially excited states in the charm sector.
