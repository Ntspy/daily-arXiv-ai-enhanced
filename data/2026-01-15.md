### [1] [BRST Symmetry Violation and Fundamental Limitations of Asymptotic Safety in Quantum Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08886)
*Farrukh A. Chishtie*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The asymptotic safety program faces foundational issues due to symmetry violations in quantum gravity, including breakdown of general covariance and BRST symmetries above certain energy scales. The study critiques its viability through multiple analyses and suggests an alternative framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the validity of the asymptotic safety approach and address its inherent theoretical and experimental inconsistencies.

Method: Combines canonical quantization and path integral calculations to assess symmetry preservation; analyzes gauge dependence, truncation convergence, experimental consistency, matter content compatibility, and unitarity in asymptotic safety.

Result: Identifies critical failures in asymptotic safety, such as symmetry violations, non-convergent truncations, conflicts with electroweak tests, and unitarity issues. Proposes the Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity as a viable alternative free of these pathologies.

Conclusion: Asymptotic safety cannot be theoretically justified due to symmetry breakdowns and pragmatically unreliable due to convergent and experimental inconsistencies. The proposed framework offers a superior alternative.

Abstract: The asymptotic safety program assumes that quantum gravity becomes renormalizable through ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based couplings. We demonstrate that this approach {encounters fundamental symmetry violations} across multiple independent criteria, all traceable to a single fundamental cause: the breakdown of general covariance and BRST symmetries above the gravitational cutoff scale. Rigorous canonical quantization proves that general covariance cannot be maintained quantum mechanically in dimensions greater than two, while recent path integral calculations reveal persistent gauge parameter dependence in quantum gravitational corrections, signaling BRST symmetry violation. These dual proofs establish that the metric tensor ceases to exist as a valid quantum degree of freedom above $Λ_{\text{grav}}$$\sim$$10^{18}$ GeV, rendering the search for ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based theories {problematic from a foundational physical perspective}. We provide comprehensive analysis demonstrating that asymptotic safety exhibits persistent gauge parameter dependence where fixed-point properties vary with arbitrary gauge choices, non-convergent truncation schemes extending to the 35th order showing no approach to stable values, experimental {tensions} with electroweak precision tests by orders of magnitude, matter content requirements incompatible with the Standard Model, absence of concrete graviton predictions due to gauge and truncation dependence, unitarity {challenges} through ghost instabilities and propagator negativity, and fundamental Wick rotation obstructions preventing reliable connection between Euclidean calculations and physical Lorentzian spacetime. We contrast this with the Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity framework that systematically avoids all asymptotic safety pathologies.

### [2] [Traversable Wormhole Solutions in f (Q, Lm) Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08888)
*K. Suhasini,G. Ravi Kiran,N. S. Kavya,C. S. Varsha,V. Venkatesha*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores traversable wormholes in $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity using four shape functions, finding exotic matter violation and viable wormhole solutions with non-minimal coupling effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity supports traversable wormholes and how non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter influences their properties.

Method: Derive field equations for Morris-Thorne wormholes with vanishing redshift function, apply four shape functions, check traversability conditions (flaring-out, asymptotic flatness), analyze energy conditions, and use embedding diagrams.

Result: All shape functions satisfy viability conditions with null energy condition violation near the throat (exotic matter). Non-minimal coupling affects both geometry and matter, confirming $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity's potential for wormhole construction.

Conclusion: The framework successfully constructs traversable wormholes, highlighting the role of non-minimal matter-geometry coupling in modifying both spacetime geometry and material requirements.

Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity, a symmetric teleparallel theory featuring non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter. Adopting a linear functional form $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m) = -α\mathscr{Q} + 2\mathscr{L}_m + β$, we derive the field equations for a static, spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne wormhole geometry with vanishing redshift function. Four distinct shape functions are considered: $b(r)=\sqrt{r_0 r}$, $b(r)=r_0\left(\dfrac{r}{r_0}\right)^γ$ (with $0<γ<1$), and $b(r)=\dfrac{r_0 \ln (r+1)}{\ln (r_0+1)}$. The geometric viability of each configuration is verified through standard traversability conditions, including the flaring-out requirement and asymptotic flatness. We analyze the energy conditions and demonstrate that, consistent with known results in wormhole physics, the null energy condition is violated in the vicinity of the throat, indicating the presence of exotic matter. In addition, we employ embedding diagrams to visualize the spatial geometry of the wormhole solutions, providing a clear geometric interpretation of the flaring-out condition at the throat. Our results suggest that $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework for constructing traversable wormholes, with the non-minimal matter-geometry coupling influencing both the geometry and the matter sector.

### [3] [Liouville theory on a horizon: point particle/scalar field duality and Page-like curve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08895)
*J-B. Roux*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper establishes a duality between point particles and massive scalar propagators, recovers black hole entropy in the EFT framework, and introduces quantum corrections to Hawking radiation with a Page-like curve, suggesting information leaks from the horizon via radiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unresolved questions in quantum gravity, particularly the information paradox, by exploring how information is encoded on black hole horizons and its implications for Hawking radiation and entropy.

Method: The authors analyze the consequences of a recent quantum gravity theory, deriving dualities through propagator comparisons, calculating entropy recovery using effective field theory methods, and modeling quantum corrections to Hawking radiation to produce a Page curve.

Result: The study confirms entropy calculations align with EFT approaches, demonstrates information leakage via Hawking radiation, and shows a modified radiation profile matching the Page curve, resolving paradoxes in black hole information loss.

Conclusion: Quantum gravitational effects enable information preservation without firewall paradoxes, redefine the role of bulk-boundary interactions in entropy, and offer a consistent framework for reconciling Hawking radiation with quantum information conservation.

Abstract: We show that the consequences of a recent paper on quantum gravity are 1) a duality between point particles and massive scalar propagators, 2) the recovery of the entropy of a boundary (a black hole) in the same form as that of the EFT approach to Quantum Gravity and 3) a quantum correction to Hawking radiations and a Page-like curve. In this recent paper, information about what lies inside a boundary is encoded onto it, meaning that in this approach the information directly leaks from the horizon to the bulk in the form of Hawking radiations.

### [4] [Dirac Sources for Nonmetricity and Torsion in Metric-affine Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09013)
*James T. Wheeler*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores coupling metric-affine gravity (GL(4) gauge theory) to a Dirac field by leveraging Lie algebra gl(4) isomorphisms with Clifford algebras Cl(3,1) and Cl(2,2), providing a framework for torsion and nonmetricity sourcing via Dirac fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coupling Dirac spinors to GL(4) gravity, which lacks Lorentz spinor representations, by utilizing Clifford algebra isomorphisms to establish a compatible interaction.

Method: The authors use the gl(4) Lie algebra's isomorphism with Cl(2,2) and Cl(3,1) to construct a real Clifford-valued connection. By expanding the GL(4) connection in the Cl(2,2) basis, they derive coupled equations where Dirac sources independently affect torsion and nonmetricity components after isolating the Lorentz subgroup so(3,1).

Result: Successful derivation of source terms for torsion and nonmetricity from Dirac fields in metric-affine gravity, demonstrating how Clifford algebra representations enable such couplings without embedding in a spin structure.

Conclusion: The approach provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for matter-gravity interaction in metric-affine theories, opening paths for future studies on quantum effects and cosmological implications of torsion/nonmetricity sourced by fermions.

Abstract: Metric-affine gravity (GL(4) gauge theory) in 4-dimensions is coupled to a spacetime Dirac source field using the isomorphisms of the Lie algebra gl(4) to the Clifford algebras Cl(3,1) and Cl(2,2). A simple transformation relates the generators of Cl(3,1) to a real representation of Cl(2,2), while the real representation of Cl(2,2) serves directly as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(4). Therefore, although GL(4) does not contain a spinor representation of the Lorentz group, expanding its Lie algebra in the Cl(2,2) basis gives a Clifford valued connection with well-defined coupling to Dirac spinors. Variation of the expansion coefficients gives new Dirac sources for both torsion and nonmetricity, separated by identifying the so(3,1) basis within the gl(4) basis.

### [5] [Wada Boundaries in Generic Polynomial PP-Wave Spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09101)
*Pedro Henrique Barboza Rossetto,Vanessa Carvalho de Andrade,Daniel Müller*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper analyzes geodesics in pp-wave spacetimes with polynomial profiles (degrees 3–10), showing their dynamics are analogous to a classical particle in a 2D harmonic polynomial potential. It demonstrates Wada property in escape basins for all degrees and finds basin entropy increases with polynomial degree, indicating higher unpredictability. Basin boundary entropy confirms fractal boundaries for n > 3, conjecturing Wada persists for n > 10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamic properties of geodesics in pp-wave spacetimes and their relationship with classical particle systems, particularly focusing on escape basins' structure and unpredictability measures.

Method: Analyzing escape basins for polynomial degrees 3–10, computing basin entropy (S_b) and boundary basin entropy (S_bb), applying the ln(2) criterion for fractality, and using the equivalence to a 2D harmonic polynomial potential for modeling.

Result: All considered polynomial degrees exhibit Wada property in escape basins. Basin entropy increases monotonically with degree, indicating enhanced unpredictability. Fractal basin boundaries confirmed for n > 3 via S_bb meeting ln(2) criterion.

Conclusion: The Wada property is robust across polynomial degrees up to 10, with fractal boundaries for higher degrees. Conjecture extends Wada property beyond n =10, suggesting intrinsic dynamical complexity.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the geodesics of pp-wave spacetimes with polynomial profiles of degrees $3\leq n\leq10$, which are dynamically equivalent to the motion of a classical particle in a two-dimensional harmonic polynomial potential. By analysing the escape basins associated with different asymptotic outcomes, we show that all basins exhibit the Wada property for every polynomial degree considered. We further compute the basin entropy $S_{b}$, finding that it increases monotonically with the polynomial degree, indicating enhanced unpredictability of the final state of the system. The boundary basin entropy $S_{bb}$ is also evaluated, and the $\ln(2)$ criterion confirms that the basin boundaries are fractal for $n>3$. We conjecture that the Wada property persists for polynomial degrees $n>10$.

*Masaki Michiwaki,Tsutomu Kobayashi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Systematically constructs ghost-free scalar-tensor theories with third-order scalar derivatives, ensuring only physical degrees of freedom propagate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend existing scalar-tensor theories by incorporating higher-order derivatives while maintaining theoretical consistency and avoiding ghost instabilities.

Method: Using ADM formalism spatially covariant Lagrangians, imposes degeneracy and consistency conditions to eliminate ghosts and restrict degrees of freedom.

Result: Derives new theories beyond generalized disformal Horndeski and U-DHOST, describing their properties under generalized disformal transformations.

Conclusion: Successful framework for higher-order scalar-tensor theories maintains theoretical stability and offers richer structures for cosmological applications.

Abstract: We systematically construct ghost-free scalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian includes up to third-order derivatives of the scalar field. Using a spatially covariant action written in terms of the ADM variables, we impose degeneracy and consistency conditions that ensure the propagation of only one scalar and two tensor degrees of freedom. The resultant theories extend the generalized disformal Horndeski and U-DHOST theories. We discuss the transformation properties of these theories under generalized disformal transformations.

### [7] [Chiellini-Integrable Cosmologies with Phantom Divide Crossing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09271)
*Soumya Chakrabarti,Nandan Roy*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents analytical cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field, showing late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing without instabilities, reducing Hubble tension compared to ΛCDM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether scalar field models can explain late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing analytically, addressing shortcomings of ΛCDM like the Hubble tension.

Method: Solved damped Ermakov-Painlevé II equations under Chiellini's condition, using BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer, and Pantheon+SHOES data for statistical analysis.

Result: Found solutions with H₀ ≳ 70 km/s/Mpc, smooth phantom crossing, and reduced Hubble tension compared to ΛCDM without pathological instabilities.

Conclusion: Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies offer a viable, analytically tractable alternative to ΛCDM for modeling cosmic acceleration and dark energy dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate exact cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity. For an extended Higgs-like scalar self-interaction, we find that the resulting field equations belong to the damped Ermakov-Painlevé II class and construct novel analytical solutions within the framework of the Chiellini integrability condition. We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \gtrsim 70 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $Λ$CDM cosmology. The results indicate that Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies are capable of providing a robust and analytically controlled framework for modeling late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing, offering a viable alternative to phenomenological dark-energy parametrizations.

### [8] [Sub-Leading Logarithms for Scalar Potential Models on de Sitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09309)
*S. P. Miao,N. C. Tsamis,R. P. Woodard*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how loop corrections in inflationary cosmology grow due to the production of long wavelength scalars and gravitons. It shows that the stochastic formalism can capture leading and first sub-leading logarithms in the effective potential, validated in a specific model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the secular growth of loop corrections during inflation and determine the applicability of Starobinsky's stochastic formalism beyond leading logarithms.

Method: The authors analyze loop corrections in scalar potential models, specifically using stochastic formalism applied to parts of the 1-loop effective potential. They test this approach in a de Sitter background with a massless scalar field possessing quartic self-interaction.

Result: The stochastic formalism successfully captures the first sub-leading logarithm at 2-loops, confirming its utility beyond leading-order terms in inflationary scenarios.

Conclusion: Stochastic methods can systematically handle sub-leading contributions in inflationary loop corrections, providing a robust framework for calculating quantum effects during inflation.

Abstract: The continual production of long wavelength scalars and gravitons during inflation injects secular growth into loop corrections which would be constant in flat space. One typically finds that each additional factor of the loop counting parameter can induce up to a certain number of logarithms of the scale factor. Loop corrections that attain this number are known as ``leading logarithms''; those with fewer are sub-leading. Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models. We show that the first sub-leading logarithm is captured by applying the stochastic formalism to a certain part of the 1-loop effective potential. This is checked at 2-loops for a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction on de Sitter background.

### [9] [Probing dynamical embeddings in a five-dimensional spacetime in light of DESI BAO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09429)
*Abraão J. S. Capistrano,Emanuelly Silva,Rafael C. Nunes,Orlando Luongo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Nash gravity, based on Nash's embedding theorem, uses extrinsic curvature perturbations to address cosmological tensions like Hubble and S8 without extra fields. It fits data well, offering H0 = 69.32 ± 0.72 km/s/Mpc and S8 ≈ 0.76, potentially resolving tensions at 2σ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative to ΛCDM that resolves H0 and S8 tensions by incorporating geometric perturbations from Nash's theorem, avoiding additional fields.

Method: Applied Nash gravity model using CMB (Planck), BAO (DESI DR2), and SN Ia data to test against ΛCDM. Evaluated model fit through statistical analysis of these datasets.

Result: Nash gravity provides a good fit, yielding higher H0 (69.32 ± 0.72) and lower S8 (~0.76), alleviating tensions. Performs better than ΛCDM in some cases at 2σ level.

Conclusion: Nash gravity is a viable alternative to ΛCDM, offering geometric explanations for cosmological tensions without dark sector modifications. Further tests with future data are encouraged.

Abstract: We here investigate the observational viability of Nash gravity as an alternative to the standard $Λ$CDM cosmology. Based on Nash's embedding theorem, the model introduces orthogonal perturbations via variations in the extrinsic curvature, generating scalar-type metric perturbations directly from geometry, without the need to introduce additional fields. We confront the model with current observational data, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, and recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) compilations. Our analysis shows that Nash gravity provides a good fit to the data, yielding a slightly higher value for the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 69.32 \pm 0.72$ km/s/Mpc, compared to the $Λ$CDM model, thus offering a potential alleviation of the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, the model naturally predicts a suppressed growth of structure, with $S_8 \approx 0.76$ across various joint analyses, potentially alleviating the so-called $S_8$ tension, assuming that this discrepancy is not solely due to systematic effects in other independent measurements. In some cases, Nash gravity achieves a better fit to the data than the $Λ$CDM paradigm at the $2σ$ level.

### [10] [Tidal dynamics and stellar disruption in charged Kalb-Ramond black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09482)
*Ednaldo L. B. Junior,Herlan N. Lemos,Marcos V. de S. Silva*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies tidal forces, geodesic deviation, and tidal disruption in Kalb-Ramond-ModMax black hole spacetimes. The parameters γ and l modulate electromagnetic nonlinearity and Lorentz symmetry violation, respectively. Key findings include tidal instability in the phantom sector and modified tidal disruption conditions influenced by these parameters, suggesting observational probes of exotic physics in strong gravitational fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Kalb-Ramond-ModMax effects (controlled by γ and l) affect tidal forces and disruptions, potentially offering a way to detect Lorentz violation and nonlinear electrodynamics in astrophysical scenarios.

Method: Analytic calculations and perturbative analysis of tidal forces (radial/angular), geodesic deviation, and Roche radius-horizon relations in Kalb-Ramond-ModMax spacetimes for both canonical (α=1) and phantom (α=-1) sectors.

Result: Radial tidal compression transitions occur between horizons with parameter control; phantom sector shows tidal instability; l shifts Roche radius relative to horizon, altering Hills mass criteria; disruptions depend on black hole mass scale with γ significant only for ultramassive systems.

Conclusion: Kalb-Ramond-ModMax effects are minor for supermassive black holes but may be observable in intermediate systems and stellar disruptions, providing a testbed for exotic physics in strong-field regimes.

Abstract: We investigate tidal forces, geodesic deviation, and tidal disruption in the black hole spacetime described by the Kalb-Ramond-ModMax solution, where electromagnetic nonlinearity is governed by the parameter $γ$ and Lorentz symmetry violation by the parameter $l$. In the canonical sector ($α=1$), the radial tidal force exhibits a transition marked by a sign inversion between the horizons $r_{-}$ and $r_+$, signaling internal regimes of radial compression analogous to those of charged black holes; the parameter $l$ controls the strength and location of this transition, while $γ$ regulates the nonlinear electromagnetic contribution. The angular tidal force is predominantly compressive, $l$ shaping the effective geometry, and $γ$ acting as a damping factor. In the phantom sector ($α=-1$), tidal forces and geodesic deviation diverge, indicating a tidal instability, with $l$ and $γ$ affecting only the magnitude of the response. We further show that $l$ shifts the relation between the horizon radius $r_+$ and the tidal disruption radius $r_{\rm Roche}$, thereby modifying the critical (Hills) mass defined by $r_{\rm Roche}=r_+$. Tidal disruption of neutron stars occurs inside the horizon for supermassive black holes, whereas Sun-like stars are disrupted outside the horizon, with $γ$ becoming relevant only for ultramassive black holes with masses $\sim 10^{8}M_{\odot}$. Our results demonstrate that Kalb-Ramon-ModMax effects are largely suppressed for supermassive black holes, but may be relevant for intermediate-mass systems and observable tidal disruption events, offering an indirect probe of Lorentz violation and nonlinear electrodynamics in the strong-field regime.

### [11] [The pseudo-complex Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker model and the time dependence of the Hubble constant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09593)
*L. Maghlaoui,P. O. Hess,F. Weber,C. A. Zen vasconcellos*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pseudocomplex version of the FLRW model within pseudocomplex General Relativity (pcGR), where dark energy emerges from pseudocomplex geometry. This results in a time-dependent Hubble parameter, with DESI BAO data yielding β=1.0426. The model predicts H₀ ≈ 0.94×10⁻¹⁷ (km/s²)/Mpc, a deceleration parameter q=-0.9361, and a redshift drift of ~-11.1 cm/s at z=4 over 20 years, aligning with ΛCDM but offering a geometric origin for dark energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative geometric explanation for dark energy without introducing ad-hoc components like the cosmological constant. The motivation is to provide a non-traditional framework (pcGR) that naturally incorporates Hubble acceleration and time-dependent expansion parameters within General Relativity.

Method: The authors derive the pseudocomplex FLRW equations in pcGR, relate the Hubble acceleration via the parameter β, and fit it using DESI BAO data. They compute the deceleration parameter q and predict redshift drift using the Sandage-Loeb relation.

Result: Fits give β=1.0426, leading to a time-varying Hubble parameter and H₀=0.94×10⁻¹⁷ (km/s²)/Mpc. The predicted redshift drift matches ΛCDM expectations for z=4 sources. pcGR's geometrically sourced acceleration avoids the cosmological constant.

Conclusion: The pseudocomplex geometry in pcGR successfully models accelerated expansion and Hubble acceleration geometrically. The predictions align with current observations, offering a testable framework for future high-precision spectroscopy to validate the non-vanishing H₀.

Abstract: The pseudocomplex version of the FLRW model is presented within the framework of pseudocomplex General Relativity (pcGR). In this approach, dark energy arises as a geometric consequence of the pseudocomplex structure, leading to a time dependent Hubble parameter rather than a strictly constant H0. The relation between the tiderived and constrained using recent DESI BAO data. Fitting beta yields a best-fit value beta = 1.0426, corresponding to a deceleration parameter q = -0.9361 and a present day Hubble acceleration me derivative of the Hubble parameter and a single geometric parameter beta in the effective dark energy equation of state is derived and constrained using recent DESI BAO data. Fitting beta yields a best-fit value beta = 1.0426, corresponding to a deceleration parameter q = -0.9361 and a present day Hubble acceleration H0 sim 0.94 x10-17 (km/s2)/Mpc. Using the exact Sandage Loeb relation, the predicted redshift drift over 20 years for a source at z = 4 is Delta-v sim -11.1 cm/s, in close agreement with the Lambda CDM prediction. In pcGR, however, the non-vanishing H0 is a direct geometric prediction, providing a clear and testable target for future high-precision spectroscopic observations.

*Ciro De Simone,Sebastian H. Völkel,Kostas D. Kokkotas,Vittorio De Falco,Salvatore Capozziello*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study evaluates the accuracy of eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting quasinormal modes of scalar fields on deformed Kerr spacetimes. Using a 2+1D numerical framework, the research quantifies theoretical uncertainties in ringdown dynamics for various parameters, compares errors with statistical uncertainties in gravitational wave observations, and finds differing effects of near-horizon deformations on prograde vs. retrograde modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test fundamental physics with gravitational waves by assessing approximate methods for computing quasinormal modes in rotating black holes beyond general relativity, ensuring precise modeling for future high-precision black-hole spectroscopy.

Method: The study combines the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations with a 2+1D numerical time-evolution framework to simulate scalar field perturbations on deformed Kerr spacetimes. This allows systematic analysis across multiple angular harmonics, spin parameters, and spacetime deformations.

Result: Theoretical uncertainties from approximations were quantified and compared against projected statistical uncertainties in gravitational wave observations. The analysis revealed that near-horizon deformations differentially affect prograde and retrograde modes, explained through geometrical principles.

Conclusion: Eikonal and post-Kerr approximations have identifiable limitations that must be considered for high-precision tests of black hole physics. The findings guide the applicability of these methods and highlight the importance of numerical approaches for accurate mode spectrum predictions in spacetimes deviating from Kerr.

Abstract: The accurate computation of quasinormal modes from rotating black holes beyond general relativity is crucial for testing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. In this study, we assess the accuracy of the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting the quasinormal mode spectrum of a scalar field on a deformed Kerr spacetime. To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation.

### [13] [A Closed-Form Surrogate for the Equivalent Diameter of the Kerr Shadow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09655)
*Arseny Pantsialei*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a closed-form surrogate model to accurately estimate the equivalent diameter of Kerr black-hole shadows across a wide range of spins and viewing angles, achieving sub-percent accuracy without numerical computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a computationally efficient method for determining black-hole shadow sizes, avoiding time-consuming numerical ray tracing, which is essential for applications like parameter inference and rapid model comparisons.

Method: The method combines an exact polar limit with a 15-parameter polynomial inside an exponential correction. Coefficients are determined via ordinary least squares on a reference grid derived from the critical-curve area. It separates the polar contribution analytically and models inclination dependence compactly.

Result: The surrogate achieves median absolute percent errors of 0.01-0.023% and worst-case errors under 1.64% across all tested parameters. It enables fast evaluations suitable for repeated use in astrophysical analysis.

Conclusion: The surrogate model offers accurate, rapid shadow size calculations for Kerr black holes, significantly streamlining computational workflows in astronomy and astrophysics.

Abstract: We present a closed-form surrogate for the equivalent diameter of the Kerr black-hole shadow, defined as the diameter of the circle with the same area as the shadow's critical curve. The construction enforces the exact face-on (polar) limit by explicitly separating an analytically computed polar contribution based on the spherical photon-orbit branch where the horizontal impact parameter vanishes. The remaining inclination dependence is captured by a compact 15-parameter polynomial placed inside an exponential correction. The coefficients are determined by ordinary least squares on a deterministic reference grid generated from the Kerr critical-curve area. Over the practical domain of dimensionless spin from 0 to 0.998 and inclination from just above 0 degrees up to 90 degrees (with the exactly polar point treated analytically), the surrogate achieves sub-percent accuracy. On the training grid the median absolute percent error is 0.0105 percent with a worst case of 0.782 percent, and on a denser out-of-sample validation set (including inclinations down to 0.5 degrees) the median, 95th-percentile, and worst-case errors are 0.023 percent, 0.471 percent, and 1.64 percent, respectively. The resulting expression provides fast evaluations of the shadow size without numerical ray tracing, making it convenient for repeated calls in parameter inference and rapid model comparisons.

*Ozan Sargın*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates inflationary dynamics in a β-exponential potential model coupled with quadratic R+R² gravity using the Palatini formalism, deriving a k-inflation theory. It finds parameter regions matching ACT/Planck observations for spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how scalar fields coupled to quadratic gravity affect cosmic inflation, focusing on extra-dimensional physics and consistency with latest cosmological data.

Method: Used Palatini formalism to derive Einstein-frame k-inflation theory from the β-exponential potential model. Scanned parameter space to predict spectral index n_s and tensor-to-scalar ratio r, comparing against ACT DR6 constraints.

Result: Identified parameter ranges where model predictions for n_s and r align with ACT/Planck data. Compliant regions are graphically represented in the study.

Conclusion: The β-exponential potential model coupled with R+R² gravity, under constant-roll conditions, can successfully describe observed inflationary parameters, supporting its viability in explaining early universe dynamics.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inflationary dynamics of the $β$-exponential potential model, where a scalar field couples to quadratic $(R + R^2)$ gravity. In this model, the inflaton is the field that determines the size of the extra dimension. We employ the Palatini formalism to derive the resulting Einstein-frame generalized $k$-inflation effective theory, which we analyze under the assumption that the constant-roll condition is satisfied.
  We scan the parameter space for inflationary predictions, specifically the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, ensuring consistency with the results from ACT DR6. The compliant regions are depicted accordingly. For a suitable range of the model parameters, the values obtained for the inflationary observables align with the most recent observations by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration and/or the Planck mission.

*Sophie Bini,Krzysztof Król,Katerina Chatziioannou,Maximiliano Isi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The analysis of GW231123, a gravitational-wave event from merging massive, highly spinning black holes, reveals that its key properties (large masses, high spin magnitudes, and precession) are robust against model systematics and Gaussian noise. Simulations using the NRSur7dq4 model confirm these results, showing consistent support for the inferred parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliable interpretation of GW231123's astrophysical implications, the study addresses challenges in parameter inference due to limited signal cycles and model-dependent biases.

Method: The team simulated signals with the NRSur7dq4 surrogate model, tested against real data, and evaluated parameter variations under different noise realizations. Comparisons between simulated and observed data quantified model systematics and noise impacts.

Result: Systematic biases in parameter estimation were replicated in simulations. Mass, spin magnitudes (median χ₁ ≥0.7), and precession (median χₚ ≥0.68) were consistent across noise realizations, while χeff showed more fluctuation. Detector differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusion: The high masses and spin magnitudes inferred for GW231123 using NRSur7dq4 are robust against model and noise uncertainties, validating the significance of these parameters for astrophysical studies.

Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptional gravitational-wave event consistent with the merger of two massive, highly-spinning black holes. Reliable inference of the source properties is crucial for accurate interpretation of its astrophysical implications. However, characterization of GW231123 is challenging: only few signal cycles are observed and different signal models result in systematically different parameters. We investigate whether the interpretation of GW231123 is robust against model systematics and Gaussian detector noise. We show that the model systematics observed in GW231123 can be reproduced for a simulated signal based on the numerical-relativity surrogate model NRSur7dq4. Simulating data using the maximum-likelihood NRSur7dq4 waveform for GW231123 and no noise realization, we closely recover the systematics observed for the real signal. We then explore how the headline properties of GW231123 are impacted by Gaussian detector noise. Using the NRSur7dq4 maximum-likelihood waveform and different noise realizations, we consistently find support for large masses, high spin magnitudes (median $χ_1\geq 0.7$), and high spin precession (median $χ_\mathrm{p}\geq 0.68$). The spin in the direction of the angular momentum ($χ_\mathrm{eff}$) fluctuates more. Finally, again comparing to simulated signals, we show that any differences in the GW231123 inference based on each separate detector are not statistically significant. These results show that the properties of GW231123, and most importantly the high mass and high spin magnitudes inferred by NRSur7dq4, are robust.

TL;DR: This paper describes an initial pathfinder search using JWST data from the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web surveys to detect high-redshift supernovae (up to z~5). It identified 68 SNe, including rare events like a z>3 CCSN and a z>2 Type Ia, demonstrating the potential for future dedicated surveys to study early cosmic transients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transient astronomy in the early Universe (z>2) is underexplored due to observational limitations. The study aims to leverage JWST's capabilities in rest-frame optical/near-IR to uncover high-redshift transients, crucial for understanding stellar evolution and cosmology.

Method: Combined data from PRIMER and COSMOS surveys (total ~133 arcmin²) yielding annual-cadence difference images. Analysis uses host galaxy photometric redshifts, SN classification, colors, and magnitudes to prioritize candidates despite limited epochs.

Result: Discovery of 68 SNe with host redshifts up to z<5, including notable cases like SN 2023aeab (z>3 CCSN) and SN 2023aeax (z>2 Type Ia SN). Results suggest wider JWST surveys can find younger/bluer transients.

Conclusion: The pathfinder shows JWST's potential for time-domain surveys to measure SN rates and population characteristics in the early Universe, urging investment in dedicated multi-epoch JWST programs for deeper exploration.

Abstract: Transient astronomy in the early Universe (z > 2) remains largely unexplored, lying beyond the rest-frame optical spectroscopic reach of most current observatories. Yet this regime promises transformative insights, with high-redshift transients providing direct access to the early Universe and enabling studies of how stellar populations and cosmology evolve over cosmic time. JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of ~133 arcmin^2 (~0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z < 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z > 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z > 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe.

### [17] [The effect of inverse Compton losses on particle acceleration in three-dimensional relativistic reconnection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09052)
*Ian Bowyer,Dimitrios Giannios,Lorenzo Sironi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the effect of inverse Compton cooling on relativistic magnetic reconnection, finding that cooling impacts trapped electrons' energy spectra but not the reconnection dynamics or free phase energization. This suggests a two-zone radiation model is needed for astrophysical sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how radiative cooling (inverse Compton) affects particle acceleration and reconnection processes in relativistic systems, particularly distinguishing between free-phase and trapped-phase electron behaviors.

Method: 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations including inverse Compton losses in the weakly cooled regime where γ_rad > σ, comparing results with prior uncooled simulations.

Result: Cooling does not alter reconnection rate or free-phase energization (spectrum ~γ⁻¹), but induces a steeper ~γ⁻³ spectrum for trapped electrons above γ_cool. This supports the two-zone acceleration model proposed in arXiv:2302.12269.

Conclusion: Radiative emission models must distinguish between free particles (rapid acceleration) and trapped particles (passive cooling) to accurately depict relativistic reconnection-powered sources like gamma-ray bursts or active galactic nuclei.

Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is a key mechanism for dissipating magnetic energy and accelerating particles in astrophysics. In the absence of radiative cooling, recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that high-energy particles gain most of their energy in the upstream region, during a short-lived "free phase" where they meander between the two sides of the layer; when they get captured/trapped by the downstream flux ropes, they undergo a "trapped phase", where no significant energization occurs. Here, we perform a suite of 3D PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection including inverse Compton (IC) losses in the weakly cooled regime in which the radiation-reaction-limited Lorentz factor $γ_{\rm rad}$ exceeds the magnetization $σ$. We show that electron cooling losses do not appreciably alter the reconnection rate, the structure of the layer, and the physics of particle acceleration in the free phase, so the spectrum of free electrons is $dN_{\rm free}/dγ\propto γ^{-1}$, as in the uncooled case. The spectrum of trapped electrons above the cooling break $γ_{\rm cool}$ (in the range $γ_{\rm cool}<γ<γ_{\rm rad}$) is $dN/dγ\propto γ^{-3}$, steeper than the scaling $dN/dγ\propto γ^{-2}$ of uncooled simulations. This confirms that no significant particle energization occurs during the trapped phase. Our results validate the model by arXiv:2302.12269 for particle acceleration in 3D relativistic reconnection, and imply that radiative emission models of reconnection-powered astrophysical sources should employ a two-zone structure, that differentiates between free, rapidly accelerating particles and trapped, passively cooling particles.

### [18] [Upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1909-3744 data from the second IPTA data release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09054)
*Jing Zou,Jingbo Wang Jianping Yuan,De Zhao,Yirong Wen,Wei Li,Na Wang,Yong Xia*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study conducted an extensive search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence pulsar timing data from IPTA-DR2. They applied dispersion measure and scattering corrections to reduce noise, identifying a residual periodic noise of 340 ns. Derived upper limits on GW strain were tighter than previous results by a factor of 1.52.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve constraints on gravitational wave signals from individual sources using advanced pulsar timing data with multi-frequency observations and refined corrections for interstellar medium effects.

Method: High-cadence observations of PSR J1909-3744 at multiple radio frequencies using three telescopes (NRT, PKS, GBT). Applied dispersion measure and scattering corrections to mitigate noise, then analyzed timing residuals to set upper limits on GW strain.

Result: Observed periodic timing residuals of 340 ns. Set upper GW strain limits of 1.9×10⁻¹⁴ (71 nHz) and 2.3×10⁻¹³ (1 μHz) for average sources, and tighter limits (6.2×10⁻¹⁵ and 8.9×10⁻¹⁴) for optimal sources. Improved limits by 1.52× over prior EPTA-based results.

Conclusion: The IPTA-DR2 data and advanced corrections significantly enhanced sensitivity to individual GW sources. These constraints provide critical benchmarks for astrophysical models predicting such gravitational wave signals.

Abstract: We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence observations of PSR J1909\(-\)3744 obtained during an intensive observing campaign with the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release (IPTA-DR2) between July 2010 and November 2012. The observations, conducted at three different radio frequencies with the Nançay Radio Telescope (NRT) and Parkes Telescope (PKS) and five frequencies with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), enabled precise corrections for dispersion measure effects and scattering variations. After these corrections, the timing residuals showed an unmodeled periodic noise component with an amplitude of 340 ns. Our analysis yields upper limits on the GW strain from individual sources, constraining it to be below \(1.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at 71 nHz and \(2.3 \times 10^{-13}\) at 1 \textmu Hz for average sky locations, while for optimal source locations the limits improve to \(6.2 \times 10^{-15}\) and \(8.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at the same frequencies, respectively. Our new limits are about a factor of 1.52 more stringent than those of Perera et al. based on an earlier EPTA data.

### [19] [Pre-Supernova Eruptions Triggered by Sudden Energy Deposition in Low-Mass Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09063)
*Shuai Zha,Han Lin,Xuefei Chen,Zhanwen Han*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates pre-supernova eruptions in low-mass (9-10 solar masses) core-collapse supernova progenitors, finding that the ejecta mass scales with energy input and highlighting faint precursor light curves that could aid in understanding stellar evolution before explosion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how explosive nuclear burning in degenerate layers leads to eruptive mass loss before supernova explosions and to assess observability of these pre-SN events.

Method: Hydrodynamic simulations with SNEC and radiative transfer calculations with STELLA were used, parameterizing energy deposition as a fraction of binding energy for He layer and H-rich envelope.

Result: Ejecta mass scales with energy input via a power law (~index 3.5); precursor light curves show ~10^39 erg/s luminosity over hundreds of days with IR brightness but remain fainter than observed envelope ejection events.

Conclusion: These pre-eruption diagnostics offer new tools for studying low-mass CCSN progenitors, with publicly shared data to support further research.

Abstract: In low-mass core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors, nuclear burning beyond oxygen can become explosive under degenerate conditions, triggering eruptive mass loss before the final explosion. We investigate such pre-SN eruptions using \texttt{SNEC} hydrodynamic simulations and realistic stellar models, parameterizing the nuclear energy deposition as a fraction of the binding energy of the combined He layer and H-rich envelope. For the lowest-mass model (9 $M_\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\sim$3.5). Across 9-10 $M_\odot$, this relation shows limited scatter within a factor of $\sim$2.6, enabling an estimation of the gained energy from $M_{\rm ej}$. The shock passage also flattens the bound envelope, which can affect the SN light curve morphology and provide another diagnostic for the eruption. Then, we compute the associated precursor light curves for the 9 $M_\odot$ model with the multi-group radiative-transfer code \texttt{STELLA}. These signals are typically faint, with bolometric luminosities of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lasting hundreds of days. Their cool black-body spectra make them brighter in the infrared, yet several magnitudes fainter than observed pre-SN precursors at the threshold for full envelope ejection. To aid future studies, we make our post-eruption stellar profiles and precursor light curves publicly available.

### [20] [Detection of a puzzling dual-superorbital hard X-ray modulation in the X-ray binary GX 301-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09226)
*Haoyang Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study identifies dual superorbital modulations (115-day and 65-day periods) in GX 301-2 using multi-method timing analysis, proposing that the stronger 115-day signal represents the true superorbital period while the 65-day period arises from its beat with the orbital period. The findings support a corotating interaction regions (CIR) origin in the stellar wind, though theoretical gaps remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the physical origin of superorbital modulations (SMs) in wind-fed X-ray binaries like GX 301-2, particularly addressing their dual-period behavior and relation to orbital periods.

Method: Analyzing Swift/BAT 157-Month survey data via Lomb-Scargle periodogram, weighted wavelet Z-transform, and Gaussian processes to detect and characterize superorbital periods, followed by evaluation of physical scenarios (e.g., CIRs in stellar winds).

Result: Identification of dual SMs at 115-day (~5σ) and 65-day (~4σ) periods. The 115-day period aligns with the orbital-superorbital period relation, interpreted as the true superorbital period. The 65-day period is a beat with the orbital period. The CIR model is favored but requires further validation.

Conclusion: Dual superorbital modulations in GX 301-2 are explained by CIR interactions in the stellar wind. While the observed orbital-superorbital period relation is consistent with this, theoretical understanding of the mechanism remains incomplete. Continued observational monitoring and CIR model development are recommended.

Abstract: The superorbital modulations (SMs) observed in wind-fed X-ray binaries remain a puzzling phenomenon in astrophysics. To investigate this behavior observationally, we analyzed the long-term hard X-ray light curve from the Swift/BAT 157-Month Hard X-ray Survey in X-ray binary GX 301-2. Using three timing analysis methods--the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the weighted wavelet Ztransform, and Gaussian processes--we identify a rare dual-SM behavior in this source: the 115-day modulation exceeds the 5$σ$ global significance level, whereas the 65-day signal only marginally reaches the 4$σ$ level. Because the 115-day period is more consistent with the previously reported linear relation between orbital and superorbital periods, we interpret 115 days as the actual superorbital period, while the weaker and less stable 65-day period is its beat modulation with the orbital period.By assessing the applicability of different physical scenarios to our results, we suggest that this dual-SM behavior is most plausibly associated with corotating interaction regions (CIRs) in the stellar wind. This framework can also account for the observed linear orbital-superorbital relation, despite the unclear physical mechanism that sets the apparent ratio between the CIR and orbital periods across sources. Further long-term monitoring of this system, together with continued theoretical development of the CIR scenario, will be essential for clarifying the origin of wind-fed SMs.

### [21] [How Plasma Properties of the Fanaroff-Riley Jet can Shape its Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09349)
*Priyesh Kumar Tripathi,Indranil Chattopadhyay,Raj Kishor Joshi,Ritaban Chatterjee,Sanjit Debnath,M. Saleem Khan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study uses 3D-MHD simulations to explore how jet injection parameters and plasma composition influence the FR I/II dichotomy in extragalactic jets, finding that mixed plasma compositions favor FR I morphologies while electron-proton jets show transitional behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The FR I/II dichotomy's origins—whether due to ambient medium differences, jet properties, or both—are unclear. Simulations are needed to systematically test these factors.

Method: Large-scale 3D-MHD simulations of low-power supersonic jets in stratified ambient media. Varying injection parameters (speed, magnetic field) and plasma compositions (hadronic vs. mixed electron-positron-proton).

Result: Mixed plasma jets develop FR I structures under same parameters. Electron-proton jets transition between FR I and FR II morphologies during evolution.

Conclusion: Both plasma composition and jet-ambient interactions play key roles in determining FR morphology transitions.

Abstract: Extragalactic jets are broadly classified into two categories based on radio observations: core-brightened jets, known as Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR I), and edge-brightened jets, classified as Type II (FR II). This FR dichotomy may arise due to variation in the ambient medium and/or the properties of the jet itself, such as injection speed, temperature, composition, magnetization, etc. To investigate this, we perform large-scale three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D-MHD) simulations of low-power, supersonic jets extending to kiloparsec scales. We inject a jet beam carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field into a denser, unmagnetized, and stratified ambient medium through a cylindrical nozzle. Our simulations explore jets with varying injection parameters to investigate their impact on morphology and emission properties. Furthermore, we examine jets with significantly different plasma compositions, such as hadronic and mixed electron-positron-proton configurations, to study the conditions that may drive transitions between FR I and FR II morphologies. We find that, under the same injection parameters, mixed plasma composition jets tend to evolve into FR I structures. In contrast, electron-proton jets exhibit a transition between FR I and FR II morphologies at different stages of their evolution.

TL;DR: The paper presents a catalog of 4539 fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed by CHIME between 2018 and 2023, including data from 3641 sources. It provides sky locations, exposure time, sensitivity, and detailed spectral analysis, reprocessed with an improved framework to validate previous findings and enable future studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compile and analyze a large FRB dataset for understanding their origins, properties, and potential as astrophysical/cosmological probes, while ensuring consistency and improving analysis methods.

Method: Used CHIME telescope data from 2018-2023 to detect FRBs, reprocessed all events with a uniform analysis framework, generated dynamic spectra, and measured parameters like dispersion measure and flux density.

Result: Catalog of 4539 FRBs from 3641 sources, validated previous inferences, confirmed detection rate consistency, and provided initial property distributions.

Conclusion: The catalog serves as a foundational resource for studying FRB characteristics, their viability as cosmological probes, and upcoming analyses to explore FRB nature and applications.

Abstract: We present a catalog of 4539 fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope between 25 July 2018 and 15 September 2023. These bursts originate from 3641 unique sources, including 981 bursts from 83 known repeating sources. For each FRB, the catalog provides a $O(10')$ estimate of sky location along with corresponding measurements of cumulative exposure time and survey sensitivity over the observing period. It includes a total-intensity dynamic spectrum between 400 and 800 MHz at 0.983 ms resolution. From this spectrum, we constrain a model of the burst morphology and measure key parameters such as arrival time, intrinsic temporal width, dispersion measure, scattering time, and flux density. This second catalog includes all FRBs from the first catalog, with every event reprocessed using a uniform and improved analysis framework. We show that previously published inferences remain valid under the updated measurements. We assess consistency of the detection rate across observational parameters, present initial distributions of burst properties, and outline ongoing and future studies that will use this catalog to investigate the nature of FRBs and their utility as astrophysical and cosmological probes.

### [23] [How Beaming Shapes the Demographics of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09425)
*Ying-Han Mao,Xiang-Dong Li*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines how different beaming models affect ULX population properties, finding the log-modified model better matches observations and enhances observable neutron star ULXs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) often exceed Eddington limits, necessitating beaming explanations. The dependence of beaming on accretion rate is critical but poorly constrained, motivating the comparison of models.

Method: Binary population synthesis was used to create X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for classical and log-modified beaming models at varying metallicities.

Result: The classical model predicts more intrinsic bright ULXs but underpredicts observables due to strong beaming. The log-modified model provides a shallower XLF slope and higher observable neutron star ULX fractions.

Conclusion: Beaming prescriptions significantly impact ULX population statistics; the log-modified model better aligns with observations and better accounts for neutron star contributions.

Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are off-nuclear compact objects with apparent luminosities above 10^39 erg/s, often exceeding the Eddington limit for stellar-mass black holes. Beaming is a commonly invoked mechanism to explain their extreme brightness, and the dependence of the beaming factor on accretion rate is a critical parameter. In this work, we investigate how different beaming prescriptions affect the predicted properties of ULX populations. Using binary population synthesis, we construct synthetic X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for both classical and log-modified beaming models at solar and sub-solar metallicities. The classical model predicts a larger intrinsic number of bright ULXs, but strong beaming reduces their observable fraction, resulting in fewer visible ULXs compared to the log-modified model. The log-modified prescription yields a shallower slope at high-luminosity, aligning better with observed XLFs, and increases the fraction of observable neutron star ULXs above 10^39 erg/s. These results underscore the significant role of the beaming law in shaping ULX statistical distributions and assessing neutron star contributions to the population.

TL;DR: The paper presents a piecewise power-law model to accurately characterize the frequency spectrum of the NANOGrav 15-year gravitational-wave background signal, offering a balance between model simplicity and physical realism for better understanding its cosmological origins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the source of the detected gravitational-wave background, whether from supermassive black-hole binaries or early Universe particle physics, by improving spectral analysis accuracy.

Method: The authors use a Bayesian model average of piecewise power-law models with varying numbers of internal nodes (constant, broken, doubly broken power laws) to reconstruct the GWB spectrum, balancing flexibility with physical plausibility.

Result: Their PPL approach provides a more accurate spectral characterization than standard models, especially for cosmologically sourced signals, and produces data products enabling quick refits of GWB models.

Conclusion: The method enhances the ability to distinguish between potential GWB sources by capturing spectral features critical for cosmological interpretations, advancing efforts to resolve the signal's origin.

Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) data set provides evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies, which is expected to originate either from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries or new particle physics in the early Universe. A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models.

TL;DR: The study examines how strong magnetic fields and rotation affect strange quark star structure using a density-dependent MIT bag model, achieving gravitational masses up to 2.8 solar masses, aligning with observations like PSR J0952-0607 and GW190814.

Motivation: To investigate the impact of magnetic fields and rotation on structural parameters of strange quark stars and validate their compatibility with observed compact object masses.

Method: Used the MIT bag model with a density-dependent bag constant and Landau quantization for magnetic fields up to 5e17 G, solved equations with LORENE library, analyzed varying magnetic fields and rotation frequencies.

Result: Models showed higher gravitational masses (up to 2.8 M☉) compared to fixed bag constant models, with max deformation of 1.55 in fast-rotating, strongly magnetized cases, matching observed pulsars and LIGO/Virgo events.

Conclusion: Density-dependent bag constant and magnetic effects enhance SQS mass predictions, supporting SQS as viable candidates for high-mass compact objects like PSR J0952-0607 and GW190814.

Abstract: We investigate the structural parameters of strange quark stars (SQS) under the influence of strong magnetic fields and varying rotational frequencies. The equation of state is computed using the MIT bag model with a density-dependent bag constant and considering the Landau quantization effect regarding the strong magnetic fields up to $5\times10^{17}\,$G in the interior of SQS. Employing the LORENE library, we calculate the structural parameters under different magnetic field strengths and rotational frequencies. Our models are compared in terms of maximum gravitational mass, deformation parameter, binding energy, and compactness. Our equation of state model demonstrates that the gravitational masses are higher than those computed using a MIT bag model with a fixed bag constant. We find the gravitational masses beyond $2.3 \,M_\odot$, which are compatible with the masses of observed compact objects, such as the ``black widow'' pulsar \emph{PSR J0952-0607}, and the \emph{GW190814} event detected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The deformation parameter and maximum gravitational mass of SQS are characterized by fitted functions accounting for variations in both magnetic field strength and rotational frequency. We find the maximum deformation parameter of 1.55 and the maximum gravitational mass of $2.8\, M_\odot$ in the fast-rotating strongly magnetized model.

*Fatemeh Kayanikhoo,Mateusz Kapusta,Miljenko Čemeljić,Wlodek Kluzniak,Leszek Zdunik*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explores the gravitational mass and Keplerian frequency of rapidly rotating strange quark stars using a density-dependent MIT bag model equation of state. It finds a minimum mass requirement for high rotational frequencies and aligns results with observed pulsar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how rotational effects influence the structural properties of strange quark stars, particularly the minimum mass needed to sustain high rotational speeds near the mass-shedding limit under a variable bag constant model.

Method: The MIT bag model with density-dependent bag constant is applied. The LORENE library calculates structural parameters for rotational frequencies between 1100-1300 Hz. Comparisons are made against fixed bag constant models to assess Keplerian frequency dependencies.

Result: A minimum mass is required for SQS to avoid mass shedding at high rotation. The Keplerian frequency shows a linear relation with gravitational mass (slope 0.08 kHz/M☉) under this model. Results on mass limits match observations for extreme pulsars.

Conclusion: Density-dependent bag constants strongly influence rotational constraints on quark stars. The model predicts mass thresholds consistent with observational data, supporting its validity for extreme astrophysical compact objects.

Abstract: We employ the MIT bag model with density-dependent bag constant for the equation of state (EOS) to estimate the gravitational mass and Keplerian frequency of rapidly rotating strange quark stars (SQS). In a companion paper we discuss the structural parameters of such rotating stars under the influence of strong magnetic fields. We use the LORENE library to compute the structural parameters at different rotational frequencies in the range of 1100-1300~Hz for a non-magnetized SQS. While there is no minimum limit for the mass of slowly rotating self-bound stars, by computing the maximum rotational frequency, known as the mass-shedding limit, we show that SQS must have a minimum mass to sustain high rotational frequencies. The mass-shedding frequency in our EOS model is lower than that estimated from the MIT bag model EOS with a fixed bag constant. The Keplerian frequency in our model depends linearly on the gravitational mass at the mass-shedding limit (and similarly on the minimum mass) with the slope of 0.08~${\rm kHz}/M_\odot$. We obtain mass limits aligned with the observational data for both the heaviest and the lightest observed pulsars.

### [27] [Blowouts of Nascent Wind Bubbles in Pulsar-Driven Supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09552)
*Mingxi Chen,Kazumi Kashiyama,Masato Sato*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explores how rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron stars (NS) formed in core-collapse events can drive blowout phenomena, producing distinct multi-band light curves. For stripped-envelope supernovae, NSs with $B_{dip} ≥ 10^{13}$ G and $P_{NS} ≤ a few ms$ cause blowout; weaker fields yield UV/optical double-peaked curves like in LSQ14bdq, while stronger fields create X-ray precursors and hypernovae. Ultra-stripped SNe and merger events produce rapid X-ray transients. This motivates multi-wavelength observations to study energetic NS formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamical and radiative impacts of energetic NS winds on supernova ejecta, determine observational signatures linked to NS properties, and constrain NS formation scenarios through multi-wavelength observations.

Method: Developed a semi-analytic framework based on multidimensional simulations to model post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, scanned NS/ejecta parameter spaces, computed survey-ready light curves for different scenarios (standard SNe, ultra-stripped SNe, mergers).

Result: 1. Blowout occurs for NSs with $B_{dip} ≥10^{13}$ G and $P_{NS} ≤ few ms$ in typical stripped SNe. 2. Weak-field NSs produce double-peaked UV/optical light curves matching LSQ14bdq. 3. Strong-field NSs create X-ray precursors and hypernovae. 4. Ultra-stripped SNe/mergers yield fast X-ray transients ($10^{2-4}$ s duration, $10^{42-48}$ erg/s luminosity).

Conclusion: Energetic NSs significantly influence supernova dynamics and produce detectable multi-band signatures. Coordinated UV/optical/X-ray surveys can constrain NS parameters and validate theoretical models of NS formation in core-collapse events.

Abstract: Formation of a rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (NS) may occur in various classes of core-collapse events. If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on multidimensional numerical studies, we construct a minimal semi-analytic framework to follow the post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, map the blowout conditions by scanning the ejecta and NS parameters, and compute survey-ready multi-band light curves. For stripped-envelope SNe with an ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} \sim 10\,M_\odot$ and an explosion energy of $E_\mathrm{sn} \sim 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, blowout occurs for NSs with magnetic field strengths of $B_{\mathrm{dip}} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{G}$ and spin periods of $P_\mathrm{NS} \lesssim \mathrm{a\ few}\,\mathrm{ms}$. Relatively weak-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \lesssim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ produce luminous double-peaked UV/optical light curves, as observed in the superluminous SN LSQ14bdq, while stronger-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \gtrsim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ result in hypernovae preceded by X-ray blowout precursors. We also examine weaker and lower-mass SN explosions representing ultra-stripped SNe and accretion- or merger-induced collapse events, in which blowout is more readily achieved over a broader range of NS parameters, producing fast X-ray transients with durations of $ 10^{2\mbox{--}4}\,\mathrm{s}$ and peak luminosities of $10^{42\mbox{--}48}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. Our results encourage coordinated UV, optical, and X-ray observations which constrain the formation of the most energetic NSs in the universe.

TL;DR: Detection of a thermonuclear X-ray burst from 4U 0614+091 with SVOM, showing unusual burst oscillations with a significant frequency drift, suggesting a very short orbital period.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the X-ray burst and burst oscillations from 4U 0614+091, investigate the frequency drift, and infer orbital parameters.

Method: Time-resolved spectroscopy with SVOM's ECLAIRs instrument; detected burst oscillations during decay phase; measured frequency and drift using spectral timing analysis.

Result: Measured frequency ν=413.674±0.002 Hz with drift ṅ=(-4.7±0.3)×10⁻³ Hz/s. Orbital period inferred to be <20 minutes based on Doppler shift interpretation.

Conclusion: The detected frequency drift implies an unusually short orbital period, placing 4U 0614+091 among the most compact low-mass X-ray binaries known.

Abstract: On 2025 January 10, a thermonuclear (Type I) X-ray burst from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary \textit{4U~0614+091} was detected with the ECLAIRs instrument on board the \textit{SVOM} mission. We present here a time-resolved spectroscopic analysis of the burst, along with the detection of burst oscillations within a 51-second interval during the decay phase. The oscillation frequency is measured to be $ν= 413.674 \pm 0.002\,\mathrm{Hz}$, consistent with previous reports. However, we detect a significant downward frequency drift over the burst duration, characterized by $\dotν = (-4.7 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz\,s^{-1}}$. This frequency evolution is atypical compared to those observed in similar burst oscillation sources. We tentatively attribute the observed drift to a Doppler shift induced by orbital motion. Under this interpretation, the inferred orbital period must be shorter than 20 minutes, placing \textit{4U~0614+091} among the most compact known low-mass X-ray binaries.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The study evaluates the capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to detect surface biosignatures on exoplanets, emphasizing the need for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and continuous spectral coverage to distinguish biogenic pigments from non-biological signals under various atmospheric conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to determine how the HWO can effectively identify potential signs of life on rocky exoplanets within the solar neighborhood. Specifically, it aims to assess measurement requirements and instrumental needs for detecting surface biosignatures, which serve as supportive evidence for atmospheric biosignatures and can detect primitive forms of photosynthesis that do not produce oxygen.

Method: The Surface Biosignatures Task analyzed detection requirements by simulating scenarios based on Earth's historical atmospheric compositions (Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern). They evaluated signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and coronagraph design parameters, such as spectral coverage continuity, to ensure biopigment features could be distinguished from abiotic backgrounds.

Result: Key findings indicate an SNR of 20-40 is necessary across 500-1100 nm for detecting biopigments under conditions of 15% coverage and 50% cloud cover. Continuous spectral coverage with multiple coronagraph channels is critical. Limited wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4-0.7 microns) are insufficient for reliable differentiation from non-biological features.

Conclusion: The study concludes that HWO's design must prioritize high SNR and uninterrupted spectral coverage to accurately detect and verify surface biosignatures. This supports the mission's goal of assessing biogenicity and exploring life's potential beyond Earth, even in cases where atmospheric oxygen is absent.

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first NASA Astrophysics flagship mission with a key science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The upcoming exoplanet census by 2040 will shift the focus from detection to understanding planetary system formation and evolution across Galactic environments. A large-scale spectroscopic survey of planet-host stars is proposed to address this need, requiring advanced facilities capable of analyzing faint stars and providing detailed stellar parameters and abundances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: By the 2040s, the exoplanet field will have detected hundreds of thousands of planets, making detection no longer the main challenge. The critical issue becomes comprehending how planetary systems form, evolve, and diversify in different stellar and Galactic environments.

Method: Proposing a high-resolution spectroscopic survey targeting tens of thousands of planet-host stars across various Galactic regions (thin/thick disks, bulge, halo, clusters) plus non-host controls. It must provide homogeneous stellar parameters, abundances, ages, and kinematics, extending to faint magnitudes beyond current spectroscopic facilities' capabilities.

Result: Enabling systematic study of relationships between planetary systems and their host stars' chemical/kinematic properties, star formation environments, and Galactic history. This data will unlock the next-generation framework for understanding planetary system diversity.

Conclusion: Such a survey is essential to transform petabytes of planet detections into a deeper astrophysical understanding, requiring next-gen spectroscopic facilities not yet planned, pushing for their development as a cornerstone of future exoplanet research.

Abstract: By the 2040s, the exoplanet field will have moved from the discovery of a few thousand planets to hundreds of thousands, thanks to Gaia DR5, TESS, PLATO, Roman, and their successors. At that stage, the key bottleneck will no longer be planet detection, but our ability to understand how planetary systems form, evolve, and diversify across different stellar and Galactic environments.
  To address this, we need a large-scale, high-resolution spectroscopic survey of planet-host stars, spanning a broad range of Galactic environments (thin and thick disks, bulge, halo, clusters, associations), and including a well-defined control sample of non-hosts. Such a survey must deliver homogeneous stellar parameters, detailed abundance determinations, ages, and kinematics for tens of thousands of hosts, extending to the faint magnitudes probed by future missions but are beyond the reach of existing and currently planned spectroscopic facilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the challenges of locating electromagnetic counterparts of GW events due to large localization areas and the necessity for efficient scheduling in wide-field surveys like ZTF.

Method: LUMOS formulates field selection and scheduling as a maximum coverage problem using MILP, optimizing observation time slots and constraints to maximize cumulative probability.

Result: Outperforms gwemopt in 1199 O4 events with 84.7% higher mean cumulative probability; framework adaptable to other missions like M4OPT.

Conclusion: MILP-based scheduling methods like LUMOS enhance the effectiveness of multi-messenger astronomy observations, demonstrating broader applicability to both ground and space-based missions.

Abstract: The detection of gravitational-wave events by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA has opened new avenues for multi-messenger astrophysics; however, electromagnetic counterparts remain elusive due to large localization uncertainties. Wide-field optical surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) play a crucial role in follow-up, but efficient scheduling is essential. In this work, we present LUMOS, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach that selects fields via a maximum coverage problem and schedules observations to maximize cumulative probability while respecting observability constraints. Using 1199 GW events from O4, we compare the LUMOS scheduler with gwemopt, showing an 84.7 percent higher mean cumulative probability and better performance in nearly all cases. While designed for ZTF, LUMOS's framework parallels the M4OPT toolkit for space missions, highlighting the broader applicability of MILP-based scheduling to both ground- and space-based follow-up.

TL;DR: The study uses machine learning to analyze Hubble Space Telescope data and identifies key parameters influencing background variations in different filters, such as Solar elevation and Earth limb angle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the drivers of background variations in Hubble's SBC observations, which are not well constrained and affect data quality.

Method: Analysis of 8,000 archival SBC observations with a machine learning model predicting background levels using 23 observational parameters.

Result: Identified key parameters like Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle, SBC temperature, and Galactic latitude as dominant factors for background variation.

Conclusion: Machine learning effectively models SBC background behavior, aiding in optimizing observation planning and data reduction strategies.

Abstract: Recent analysis of 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data has shown that background levels can vary considerably between observations, with most filters showing over an order of magnitude variation. For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude.

Result: Identified explicit correspondences between measured EDMs and SME coefficients, providing a foundation for future experiments to constrain Lorentz violation parameters.

Conclusion: The developed methodologies offer a pathway for setting the first limits on certain SME coefficients through upcoming EDM measurements, advancing tests of Lorentz and CPT symmetry.

Abstract: We investigate Lorentz- and CPT-violating effects in neutron and storage-ring electric dipole moment (EDM) experiments within the framework of the Standard-Model Extension (SME). For neutron EDM experiments, perturbation theory is applied to derive leading-order contributions to the spin precession frequency arising from Lorentz and CPT violation. For storage-ring experiments, a generalized Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation is used to determine the corresponding spin-precession modifications. The analysis establishes explicit correspondences between measured EDMs and specific SME coefficients, providing a basis for setting the first limits on several previously unconstrained coefficients for Lorentz violation in future studies.

TL;DR: The paper explores how Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) can accommodate dark matter (DM) as QCD-singlet fields under the SU(3)^3 quark flavor symmetry, explaining leptonic flavor observables like K+ → π+ νν̄ or B+ → K+ νν̄. It shows a unified explanation for both excesses requires non-minimal setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address experimental anomalies in K+ → π+ νν̄ and B+ → K+ νν̄ within MFV, while providing a stable DM candidate and testing the consistency of MFV with flavor physics.

Method: Constructs DM-MFV models with QCD-singlet fields transforming under SU(3)^3, analyzes their interaction potentials, and confronts predictions with experimental data on LFV processes.

Result: Single DM multiplet setups can explain either K+ or B+ excesses but not both. A unified explanation requires extended models beyond the minimal configuration.

Conclusion: MFV-based flavored DM frameworks offer a testable bridge between DM phenomenology and precision flavor physics, necessitating future experiments to clarify discrepancies.

Abstract: Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) provides a compelling framework for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, in which new QCD-singlet fields transforming under the global $\mathrm{SU}(3)^3$ quark flavor symmetry can naturally be stable and act as dark matter (DM) candidates. We show that the DM-MFV framework naturally accommodates the excess in either $K^+ \to π^+ ν\barν$ or $B^+ \to K^+ ν\barν$, while a unified explanation of both channels simultaneously cannot be achieved within a minimal setup containing only a single dark matter multiplet with nearly degenerate masses. Overall, our findings underscore the intricate interplay between MFV-based model building, flavored dark matter scenarios, and precision flavor experiments, highlighting flavored dark matter as a framework that is both theoretically robust and experimentally testable.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel search strategy using the LHCb VELO detector to detect quirks through their unique back-to-back, planar hit patterns, targeting parameter regions not covered by ATLAS and CMS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quirks are heavy particles connected by a flux tube from a hidden confining force, remaining unconstrained in many parameter spaces. Existing searches have limitations, so the paper aims to exploit LHCb's unique forward geometry and software trigger to detect these particles.

Method: The authors use simulated VELO detector geometry and geometric selections to model quirk pair signatures (back-to-back, planar hits with little transverse recoil) and project sensitivity for detection.

Result: Simulations show LHCb VELO could access parameter regions unexplored by previous ATLAS/CMS experiments, offering a complementary discovery path for quirks through its specialized setup.

Conclusion: The proposed LHCb VELO methodology provides a unique experimental approach to detecting quirks, expanding the search for these particles beyond existing collider experiments' capabilities.

Abstract: Quirks are heavy particles connected by a flux tube from a hidden confining force that remain weakly constrained in large regions of their parameter space. This flux tube acts as a string that, at short enough distance, stretches as the quirk pair separates, then pulls the pair back together leading to interesting dynamics. We propose a novel search using the LHCb Vertex Locator (VELO), whose forward geometry and software-based trigger are uniquely suited to detecting the characteristic back-to-back, planar hit patterns produced by quirk pairs with little transverse recoil. Using detailed simulations of the VELO geometry, together with simple geometric selections, we present different sensitivity projections, demonstrating that LHCb can probe parameter regions inaccessible to existing ATLAS and CMS searches and offering a powerful, complementary path toward discovering quirks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new strategy to detect heavy neutrinos with non-universal couplings at the LHC using an s-channel production mechanism and machine learning, enhancing sensitivity across a wide mass range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe heavy neutrino interactions beyond the Standard Model, particularly addressing the challenge of detecting these particles over a broad mass range with improved sensitivity compared to existing methods.

Method: A combined approach using s-channel production at lower masses and vector boson fusion at higher masses, supplemented by gradient-boosted decision trees for signal/background classification, tested under 3000 fb⁻¹ luminosity.

Result: The method achieves sensitivity to mixing parameters |V_{ℓN}|² between 10⁻⁵ and 1 for neutrino masses from 50 GeV to 10 TeV, improving discovery potential at the LHC.

Conclusion: This strategy provides a complementary and enhanced pathway for LHC searches of heavy neutrinos, extending detectability across both low and high-mass regimes with machine-learning optimization.

Abstract: We propose a new strategy to probe heavy neutrinos with non-universal fermion couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using a novel production mechanism and machine-learning algorithms. Focusing on proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6~\mathrm{TeV}$, we investigate final states containing a charged lepton, missing transverse energy, and two jets. For heavy neutrino masses below $\mathcal{O}(1~\mathrm{TeV})$, production is dominated by the $s$ channel process. At higher masses, vector boson fusion becomes the dominant production mechanism, with cross sections that decrease slowly as the heavy neutrino mass increases. We simulate both signal and Standard Model background events and employ gradient-boosted decision trees to optimize event classification. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$, expected for the high-luminosity, and considering realistic statistical and systematic uncertainties, we find that heavy neutrinos in the mass range $50~\mathrm{GeV}$--$10~\mathrm{TeV}$ can be probed with sensitivity to the mixing parameter $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ spanning from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ to 1. This approach enhances the discovery potential for heavy neutrinos and provides a complementary pathway to existing search strategies.

Motivation: To address the origin of cosmic baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance while maintaining the axion solution to the strong CP problem, without relying on inflationary details.

Method: Integrates the Peccei-Quinn mechanism with a Type-I seesaw sector, using Hubble-induced masses and PQ-violating operators to drive early-time axion rotation. Analyzes parametric ranges for right-handed neutrino masses and Hubble scales compatible with observed conditions.

Result: Identifies viable parameter regions for axion cogenesis that preserve the strong CP solution and avoid excessive isocurvature perturbations, demonstrating kinetic misalignment as a robust and predictive mechanism independent of inflationary physics.

Conclusion: Kinetic axion misalignment provides a unified, predictive pathway for simultaneous baryogenesis and dark matter generation, consolidating core cosmological puzzles within a single axion-driven framework.

Abstract: We propose a generic axion--driven cogenesis scenario in which both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance originate from the kinetic misalignment. The framework unifies the Peccei--Quinn (PQ) mechanism with a Type--I seesaw sector, where Hubble--induced masses and higher-dimensional PQ--violating operators drive early--time axion rotation. Working within the DFSZ axion model augmented by heavy neutrinos, we identify the parametric window of right-handed neutrino masses, determined by its decay rate, and the range of Hubble scales compatible with successful cogenesis, while maintaining the axion solution to the strong CP problem and satisfying current limits on axion isocurvature perturbations. Our results establish kinetic axion misalignment as a robust and predictive mechanism for axion cogenesis, independent of the inflationary microphysics.

### [40] [Light neutrinophilic WIMP in the $U(1)_{\rm B-L+xY}$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09310)
*Tatsuya Aonashi,Shigeki Matsumoto,Yu Watanabe,Yuki Watanabe*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neutrinophilic framework for sub-GeV thermal dark matter using an additional U(1) gauge symmetry, addressing constraints from cosmic microwave background observations while allowing relic abundance matching and potential solutions to small-scale structure issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore sub-GeV dark matter as a thermal relic while evading stringent constraints from CMB observations that disfavor standard s-wave annihilation into Standard Model particles.

Method: Introduces a new U(1)_{B−L+xY} gauge symmetry where the dark matter annihilates predominantly into neutrinos, suppressing interactions with charged leptons and avoiding hadronic final states.

Result: Identifies viable parameter regions for sub-GeV dark matter with proper relic abundance via freeze-out, retaining self-interactions to address small-scale structure problems, while complying with cosmological and experimental constraints.

Conclusion: This framework provides a viable path for sub-GeV thermal dark matter, offering a solution to CMB constraints and potential improvements in resolving cosmological structure tensions.

Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter is an appealing thermal target because it can still be produced via the standard freeze-out mechanism; at such low masses, achieving freeze-out naturally points to the presence of a light mediator, which shifts the most promising discovery avenues from the energy frontier to the intensity frontier. Realizing this picture is nonetheless challenging, since CMB observations tightly constrain energy injection from dark-matter annihilation at recombination and therefore strongly disfavor simple $s$-wave annihilation into visible Standard-Model final states. In this work, we propose a concrete neutrinophilic framework for sub-GeV thermal dark matter (''light WIMPs'') based on an additional gauge symmetry $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{L}+x\mathrm{Y}}$; for an appropriate choice of $x$, the new gauge boson couples predominantly to dark matter and neutrinos while its couplings to charged leptons are suppressed, so that sub-GeV dark matter annihilates almost exclusively into neutrinos, with hadronic modes kinematically closed. We map the parameter space in which the observed relic abundance is reproduced via standard thermal freeze-out in a conventional cosmological history, and show that sizable regions remain viable after imposing current cosmological, indirect-detection, and terrestrial constraints; in part of the allowed parameter space, the dark matter also exhibits sufficiently large self-interactions to potentially alleviate small-scale structure tensions.

*Chentao Tan,Zhun Lu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates near-threshold photoproduction of heavy vector mesons ($J/ψ$ and $Υ$) using a GPD spectator model, validates results with experimental data, and provides predictions for future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand gluon dynamics in protons at low energies and validate GPD factorization framework against recent experimental data.

Method: Computed gluon GPDs via a spectator model where the proton emits a gluon and keeps a spectator particle. Parameters were tuned to match global PDF data. Compared results with GlueX/J/$ψ$-007 experiments and predicted $Υ$ cross sections.

Result: Good agreement with existing $J/ψ$ data (differential/total cross sections). Predictions for $Υ$ production offered for future EIC tests.

Conclusion: GPD framework effectively describes near-threshold photoproduction. Experimental validation reinforces model's reliability, highlighting its applicability for studying gluon distributions and future quarkonium physics.

Abstract: We study the near-threshold exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons (quarkonia $J/ψ$ and $Υ$) off the proton within the framework of generalized parton distribution (GPD) factorization. The gluon GPDs are computed using a spectator model in which the proton emits a gluon and the remaining constituents are treated as a single spectator particle. Model parameters are determined by fitting the gluon unpolarized and helicity collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) from global analyses. We compare our results with the latest near-threshold $J/ψ$ production data from the GlueX and $J/ψ$-007 experiments at Jefferson Laboratory, finding good agreement for both differential and total cross sections. Predictions are also provided for $Υ$ photoproduction, which can be tested at future Electron-Ion Colliders.

### [42] [Explicit rephasing to Kobayashi-Maskawa representation and fundamental phase structure of CP violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09389)
*Masaki J. S. Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a rephasing transformation to convert any unitary matrix into the Kobayashi-Maskawa parameterization, identifying all independent CP phases in the mixing matrix. It demonstrates that Majorana phases can be represented through fermion-specific phases and their relative phases, with a specific expression for the KM phase when neglecting certain matrix elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the structure of CP violation in fermion mixing matrices and systematically identify all independent CP phases, particularly in the context of Majorana neutrinos and the Kobayashi-Maskawa framework.

Method: The authors construct an explicit rephasing transformation applicable to any unitary matrix, transforming it into the KM parameterization. They analyze the resulting phases and derive expressions for Majorana phases using fermion-specific diagonalization matrices, focusing on scenarios where certain matrix elements (3-1 components) are neglected.

Result: The study shows that Majorana phases arise from fermion-specific KM phases and their relative phases. A concise formula for the KM phase is derived when ignoring U_{31} elements, expressed as a sum of two arguments involving ratios of matrix elements from diagonalization matrices.

Conclusion: The rephasing transformation provides a unified framework to characterize CP phases in mixing matrices. The derived expressions simplify analyzing CP violation effects, especially in scenarios where specific matrix elements are negligible, offering insights into neutrino physics and flavor mixing.

Abstract: In this letter, we construct an explicit rephasing transformation that converts an arbitrary unitary matrix into the Kobayashi--Maskawa (KM) parameterization and identify all independent CP phases in the mixing matrix as the arguments of its matrix elements. Furthermore, by applying this rephasing transformation to the fermion diagonalization matrices $U^{f}$, we show that the Majorana phases are represented by fermion-specific phases $δ^{ν, e}_{\rm KM}$ and their relative phases. In particular, by neglecting the 3-1 elements $U_{31}^{ν,e}$ of the diagonalization matrices for the two fermions, the KM phase $δ_{\rm KM}$ is concisely expressed by fermion-specific rephasing invariants involving two relative phases $δ_{\rm KM} = \arg \left [1 + ({U^{e * }_{21} U^ν_{21} / U^{e * }_{11} U^ν_{11} }) \right ] + \arg \left [ - { U_{32}^{e *} U_{32}^ν / U^{e * }_{22} U^ν_{22} } \right] $.

Result: Successfully derives perturbation theory corrections without sums over intermediate states, showing the effectiveness of the supersymmetric approach.

Conclusion: The supersymmetric expansion algorithm offers a promising alternative to conventional Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory, streamlining calculations through integral-based expressions.

Abstract: In this work we show that results of Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory can be easily obtained using the recently proposed supersymmetric expansion algorithm. Our formalism avoids the sums over intermediate states and yield directly corrections to the energy and eigenstates in terms of integrals weighted by the probability densities for the edge states of the involved supersymmetric Hamiltonians.

*Giovanni Pelliccioli,Emanuele Re*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents the first comprehensive study of spin correlations in WZ production at the LHC, considering NLO QCD corrections and SMEFT dimension-six operators affecting the electroweak triple-gauge coupling. It performs quantum tomography of the diboson system, linking results to purity and spin-entanglement measures, and highlights issues with SMEFT truncation effects on spin interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how NLO QCD effects and SMEFT modifications influence spin correlations in WZ production, and assess the validity of truncated SMEFT expansions in interpreting quantum tomography data.

Method: Performed full quantum-state tomography of WZ systems using spin-density matrices, incorporating NLO QCD corrections and dimension-six SMEFT operators. Analyzed purity and entanglement measures to quantify effects from both QCD and SMEFT contributions.

Result: Found significant impacts from both NLO QCD and SMEFT dimension-six operators on spin correlations. Demonstrated that truncating SMEFT at dimension-six can lead to misleading spin interpretations of tomography results.

Conclusion: Spin observables in WZ production are sensitive probes of both QCD and BSM physics via SMEFT. Caution is needed when interpreting SMEFT effects due to truncation limitations, suggesting future work must consider higher-dimension operators for accurate analyses.

Abstract: We perform for the first time a full study of spin correlations in inclusive WZ production at the LHC with leptonic decays in the presence of NLO QCD corrections and of effects from a dimension-six operator in the SMEFT modifying the electroweak triple-gauge coupling. We carry out the complete quantum-state tomography of the di-boson system and relate its results to common purity and spin-entanglement markers, highlighting the sizeable impact of both QCD corrections and SMEFT insertions. Additionally, we show how a naive truncation at dimension-six in the SMEFT expansion of the spin-density matrix can lead to a cumbersome spin interpretation of the quantum-tomography results.

### [45] [Modulus stabilization of modular flavor models in Jordan frame supergravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09542)
*Fei Wang,Ying Kai Zhang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a modular flavor model in Jordan frame supergravity with non-minimal scalar-curvature coupling, deriving constraints on the frame function and Kähler potential. It shows that scalar potentials differ significantly in the Einstein frame, potentially leading to a runaway vacuum at the $i\infty$ fixed point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional single modulus stabilization mechanisms by incorporating modular invariance and analyzing frame transformations between Jordan and Einstein frames, ensuring consistent stringy constraints.

Method: The authors use supergravity framework with non-minimal coupling $Φ(τ,\barτ)R$, derive the Kähler potential via $Φ=-3\exp[-K/3]$, perform scale transformations between frames, and numerically analyze modulus stabilization in simplified scenarios.

Result: The scalar potential in the Einstein frame exhibits distinct behavior from conventional models, with a potential stationary point at $i\infty$ creating a runaway vacuum. Numerical analysis supports stabilization feasibility under specific conditions.

Conclusion: Modular invariance imposes stringent constraints on frame functions and potentials, yielding non-traditional stabilization dynamics. This approach offers a novel pathway for understanding modulus stabilization in string-inspired scenarios, highlighting differences between Jordan and Einstein frame dynamics.

Abstract: We propose to discuss the modular flavor model and the stabilization of single modulus field in the Jordan frame supergravity with non-minimal scalar-curvature coupling of the form $Φ(τ,\barτ)R$. Modular invariance and positivity of the scale factor constrain stringently the form of the frame function, consequently the Kahler potential by the relation $Φ(τ,\barτ)=-3\exp[-K(τ,\barτ)/3]$. We discuss some general properties of scalar potentials after the scale transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. We find that the shape of the resulting scalar potential in the Einstein frame is quite different from that of ordinary single modulus stabilization mechanism. The scalar potential could be stationary at the $i\infty$ fixed point, leading to a runaway type vacuum. We also discuss numerically the modulus stabilization for some simplified scenarios.

*Mohammad Mahdi Altakach,Priyanka Lamba,Fabio Maltoni,Kazuki Sakurai*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how beam polarization in lepton-lepton collisions affects the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs (e.g., $t\bar{t}$, $τ^+τ^-$), focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, and quantum information measures. It derives analytical expressions for spin-density matrices under various helicity configurations, incorporating Standard Model and new-physics effects. The study highlights enhanced sensitivity to non-standard interactions and demonstrates the utility of quantum observables in probing top-quark interactions at future colliders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage beam polarization to uncover richer spin configurations and improve sensitivity to new physics beyond the Standard Model in heavy-fermion production, particularly in $t\bar{t}$ systems at future linear colliders.

Method: Analytic derivation of spin-density matrices for various helicity configurations using an effective field theory framework, including Standard Model terms and new physics operators (scalar, vector, tensor four-fermion interactions). Quantum measures like Bell-inequality violation, purity, and magic are analyzed.

Result: Beam polarization significantly enhances the detectability of non-standard interactions and quantum properties. The study shows quantum observables (spin correlations/entanglement) offer a powerful probe of top-quark interactions and impose stronger constraints on new physics scales in $t\bar{t}$ production scenarios.

Conclusion: Beam polarization provides enhanced sensitivity to new physics and quantum effects in heavy-fermion systems. Quantum information-based observables are recommended for experimental programs at future colliders to better constrain top-quark interactions and new physics contributions.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $τ^+τ^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information--theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.

*Er-Hao Shang,Jun-Nan Lu,Gui-Jun Ding,Stephen F. King*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines minimal modular fixed point models with two right-handed neutrinos (2RHNs) and three modular fixed points, identifying viable models using S₄' and A₅ symmetries. These models offer precise predictions for neutrino masses and mixing matrices, introducing new sum rules distinct from traditional Littlest Seesaw frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore highly predictive neutrino mass models that align with experimental data, extending beyond existing Littlest Seesaw Models by incorporating modular symmetry frameworks and testing their viability against latest oscillation data.

Method: An exhaustive scan of all models under the 2RHN framework with S₄' or A₅ symmetry, analyzing neutrino mass parameters and mixing matrices, and comparing results to global neutrino oscillation data. The study introduces generalized Dirac columns leading to novel mixing angle sum rules.

Result: Multiple viable modular form alignments and fixed points were found. New sum rules for solar/reactor angles were identified, differing from TM1 predictions. Predictions for atmospheric angles and CP phases align with current data and future experimental sensitivities (JUNO, T2HK, DUNE).

Conclusion: Modular symmetry models with S₄'/A₅ symmetry provide a promising approach for neutrino physics, offering testable predictions that can be validated by upcoming experiments. The generalized Dirac column structures reveal fresh insights beyond conventional frameworks.

Abstract: We perform a general analysis of minimal modular fixed point models based on two right-handed neutrinos (2RHNs) and three modular fixed points, and find that the only viable possibilities are based on modular $S_4'$ and $A_5$ symmetry. Such models are highly predictive, with neutrino masses and the lepton mixing mixing matrix being fixed by three real parameters, as in the Littlest Seesaw Models. We perform an exhaustive scan over all possible models in this class and find many viable fixed points and modular form alignments, after confronting them with the latest neutrino oscillation global fits. The resulting models have the new feature that the two Dirac columns take more general forms than traditional Littlest Seesaw models, resulting in new sum rule relations between the solar and reactor angles, beyond those associated with TM1 (where the first column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix is preserved), which are compared to present and future projected JUNO results. We also compare the predictions of these models for the atmospheric angle and CP violating phase to current global fits and future T2HK and DUNE sensitivities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate determination of Higgs properties at LHC and future colliders requires precise calculation of decay modes, especially incorporating higher-order corrections beyond leading order.

Method: Computed two-/three-body Higgs decays at NLO in QCD and electroweak interactions using SMEFT. Four-body decays were treated with NWA, implemented in public Monte Carlo program NEWiSH.

Result: Obtained NLO SMEFT predictions for Higgs decays. Demonstrated New Physics sensitivity and electroweak correction impacts for HL-LHC, Tera-Z, and Higgstrahlung scenarios.

Conclusion: NEWiSH provides essential NLO SMEFT simulation capability for interpreting precision Higgs measurements, enabling improved constraints on beyond-Standard Model physics.

Abstract: The calculation of precise predictions for Higgs decays is a necessary ingredient for determining Higgs properties at the LHC and future colliders. We compute all two- and three-body Higgs decays at next-to-leading order (NLO) in both QCD and electroweak interactions using the dimension-6 Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Results for four-body Higgs decays that are accurate to NLO QCD/electroweak order in the SMEFT are obtained using the narrow width approximation. Our results are contained in a flexible Monte Carlo program, NEWiSH, that is publicly available and we illustrate the impact of the NLO electroweak corrections for HL-LHC, Tera-Z, and Higgstrahlung projections.
