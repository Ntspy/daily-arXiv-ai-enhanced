### [1] [SGNL: Scalable Low-Latency Gravitational Wave Detection Pipeline for Compact Binary Mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04730)
*Yun-Jing Huang,Chad Hanna,Leo Tsukada,Amanda Baylor,Patrick Godwin,Prathamesh Joshi,James Kennington,Cody Messick,Surabhi Sachdev,Ron Tapia,Zach Yarbrough*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: SGNL is a new gravitational-wave search pipeline that offers improved scalability and lower latency compared to GstLAL, achieved through modern frameworks like Streaming Graph Navigator and PyTorch GPU acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address GstLAL's limitations in computational scalability and latency, necessitating a more modern, modular, and efficient pipeline design.

Method: Reimplementation of matched-filtering using Streaming Graph Navigator for flexible pipeline design and PyTorch for GPU acceleration, along with a novel pre-synchronized Low-Latency Online Inspiral Detection algorithm.

Result: SGNL matches GstLAL's detection performance in mock data challenges but reduces median latency by 42% (5.4s vs 9.3s).

Conclusion: SGNL successfully provides both computational advantages and lower latency, offering a viable upgrade path for gravitational-wave detection systems.

Abstract: We present SGNL, a scalable, low-latency gravitational-wave search pipeline.
It reimplements the core matched-filtering principles of the GstLAL pipeline
within a modernized framework. The Streaming Graph Navigator library, a
lightweight Python streaming framework, replaces GstLAL's GStreamer
infrastructure, simplifying pipeline construction and enabling flexible,
modular graph design. The filtering core is reimplemented in PyTorch, allowing
SGNL to leverage GPU acceleration for improved computational scalability. We
describe the pipeline architecture and introduce a novel implementation of the
Low-Latency Online Inspiral Detection algorithm in which components are
pre-synchronized to reduce latency. Results from a 40-day Mock Data Challenge
show that SGNL's event recovery and sensitivity are consistent with GstLAL's
within statistical and systematic uncertainties. Notably, SGNL achieves a
median latency of 5.4 seconds, a 42\% reduction compared to GstLAL's 9.3
seconds.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific
inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior
inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged
observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution
(and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly
inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based
on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions
yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal
posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias.
To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint
source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.

### [3] [Optimizing broadband microwave absorbers for applications in the 70-200 GHz range](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05309)
*Gaganpreet Singh,Rustam Balafendiev,Mahesh Singh Bist,Thomas J. L. J. Gascard,Gagandeep Kaur,Vid Primožič,Jon E. Gudmundsson*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper investigates square-tiled microwave absorbers, showing that unit cell size relative to wavelength is crucial for performance, while material properties have less impact. Designs achieve 99.5-99.9% absorption at 70-200 GHz. Impedance tapers (exponential, Klopfenstein, linear) perform similarly with optimal unit cell sizes of 1-4 mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how material properties, frequency, geometry, and unit cell size affect microwave absorber performance, particularly focusing on absorption efficiency and specular reflectance.

Method: Conducted numerical simulations and measurements to analyze square-tiled microwave absorbers. Tested various unit cell sizes, material properties, and impedance tapers (exponential, Klopfenstein, linear) across 70-200 GHz frequency range.

Result: Unit cell size relative to wavelength is critical for absorption performance. Absorbers achieved 99.5-99.9% absorption at 70-200 GHz with low specular reflectance not ensuring high absorption. Different tapers perform similarly when cell size is optimized (1-4 mm). Experimental data validated simulations.

Conclusion: Absorber design must prioritize unit cell scaling over material selection. Exponential, Klopfenstein, and linear tapers are effective with optimal cell sizes, enabling high absorption in millimeter-wave applications.

Abstract: We present results of an extensive suite of numerical simulations that probe
square-tiled microwave absorber performance as a function of material
properties, frequency, geometry, and unit cell size. The work, which probes
both specular reflection and total absorption, highlights the critical
importance of the absorber scale size relative to the incidence wavelength
while suggesting that material properties have a comparatively weaker impact on
overall performance. We show that some absorber designs can achieve 99.5-99.9%
frequency-averaged absorption across the 70 to 200 GHz range for normal
incidence and that low specular reflectance does not necessarily guarantee
optimal absorption performance. Our results indicate that exponential,
Klopfenstein, and linear impedance tapers provide comparable performance as
long as a unit cell size of 1 to 4 mm is chosen. Simulation results are
validated against measurements of specular reflectance.

*Aayush Saxena*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper uses variational autoencoders to automatically discover galaxy populations from JWST spectra, revealing distinct astrophysical classes without prior classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an unsupervised method capable of identifying unique galaxy types from large spectroscopic datasets like JWST, enabling automated discovery without relying on predefined classifications.

Method: Application of variational autoencoders (VAEs) on high-redshift JWST spectra data to cluster and identify distinct galaxy populations in an unsupervised manner.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the capability to discover new and exciting galaxy types through automated analysis, highlighting potential for future large-scale surveys.

Conclusion: VAE-based unsupervised learning is effective for uncovering hidden galaxy populations, offering a powerful tool for analyzing extensive spectroscopic data from missions like JWST.

Abstract: We apply variational autoencoders to automatically discover galaxy
populations using publicly available high-redshift \textit{JWST} spectra
without prior classification knowledge. Our unsupervised method identifies
distinct astrophysical classes of unique and exciting galaxy types,
demonstrating automated discovery capabilities for large spectroscopic surveys.

### [5] [$\texttt{unimpeded}$: A Public Nested Sampling Database for Bayesian Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05470)
*Dily Duan Yi Ong,Will Handley*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'unimpeded', a Python library and data repository that provides pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC chains for cosmological model analysis, enabling efficient Bayesian inference, model comparison, and tension quantification using normalized posteriors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many researchers find computational requirements for Bayesian evidences and normalized posteriors prohibitive, limiting comprehensive model comparison and tension quantification. Traditional MCMC methods only provide unnormalized posteriors suitable for parameter estimation, not full Bayesian analysis.

Method: The tool uses Cobaya and CAMB to compute pre-processed datasets with nested sampling and MCMC across 8 cosmological models and 39 datasets. It includes tension statistics calculators for six metrics and an API for accessing data stored on Zenodo.

Result: The library enables rapid analysis of cosmological models via pre-computed results, eliminating the need for resource-intensive computations. It supports pairwise dataset comparisons and systematic model evaluation against multiple probes.

Conclusion: Unimpeded democratizes access to advanced Bayesian cosmological analysis by providing a scalable, reproducible framework. It advances model comparison and data tension studies, akin to the Planck Legacy Archive but incorporating nested sampling for a more complete Bayesian treatment.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is central to modern cosmology. While parameter estimation
is achievable with unnormalised posteriors traditionally obtained via MCMC
methods, comprehensive model comparison and tension quantification require
Bayesian evidences and normalised posteriors, which remain computationally
prohibitive for many researchers. To address this, we present
$\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository
providing DiRAC-funded (DP192 and 264) pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC
chains with their normalised posterior samples, computed using
$\texttt{Cobaya}$ and the Boltzmann solver $\texttt{CAMB}$.
$\texttt{unimpeded}$ delivers systematic analysis across a grid of eight
cosmological models (including $\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions) and 39 modern
cosmological datasets (comprising individual probes and their pairwise
combinations). The built-in tension statistics calculator enables rapid
computation of six tension quantification metrics. All chains are hosted on
Zenodo with permanent access via the unimpeded API, analogous to the renowned
Planck Legacy Archive but utilising nested sampling in addition to traditional
MCMC methods.

### [6] [SRGt 062340.2-265751 confirmed as a nova-like cataclysmic variable with a possible magnetic nature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04738)
*V. A. Cúneo,A. D. Schwope,J. Kurpas,A. Avakyan,J. Brink,D. A. H. Buckley,C. Maitra,M. Veresvarska*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of SRGt 062340.2-265751, a cataclysmic variable, using XMM-Newton, eROSITA, and ASAS-SN data reveals an orbital period of ~3.6 hours, tentative magnetic white dwarf spin periods (~43 and 36 minutes), and multi-temperature thermal plasma spectra. The system resembles a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like object with possible intermediate polar characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize SRGt 062340.2-265751, which was previously identified via eROSITA's X-ray variability but lacked detailed multi-wavelength analysis. The study aims to determine its orbital parameters, accretion behavior, and potential magnetic field properties.

Method: Spectral and timing analyses using XMM-Newton X-ray/UV data, eROSITA all-sky survey data (eRASS1-4), and ASAS-SN optical photometry. Model fitting of energy spectra and period searches were conducted for timing features.

Result: Detected 3.6-hour orbital period; 43-minute and 36-minute X-ray modulations suggesting magnetic white dwarf spin; multi-temperature X-ray spectra (0.23, 0.94, 5.2 keV); UV-to-IR SED consistent with a disc-dominated nova-like system. X-ray luminosity ~1e32 erg/s. ASAS-SN confirms VY Sculptoris-type behavior.

Conclusion: SRGt 062340.2-265751 is classified as a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like system with possible intermediate polar features due to magnetic signatures. This supports emerging links between magnetic cataclysmic variables and classical nova-like systems.

Abstract: SRGt 062340.2-265751, a cataclysmic variable identified by SRG/eROSITA due to
its significant X-ray variability, remains poorly characterised despite
multi-wavelength follow-up. We present spectral and timing analyses from the
first dedicated X-ray and ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton,
complemented by SRG/eROSITA data from four all-sky surveys (eRASS1-4) and
ASAS-SN optical photometry. Our timing analysis reveals a
>8$\sigma$-significant modulation at 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 hours, likely representing
the orbital period. Long-term ASAS-SN monitoring confirms the source as a VY
Sculptoris-type nova-like system, while short-timescale X-ray and ultraviolet
variability, down to a few minutes, suggests a possible underlying magnetic
white dwarf. Two additional significant X-ray modulations at 43 $\pm$ 1 min and
36.0 $\pm$ 0.7 min tentatively point to the spin period of an intermediate
polar. The best-fit XMM-Newton energy spectra reveal a multi-temperature
thermal plasma ($kT$ = 0.23, 0.94, and 5.2 keV), while the SRG/eROSITA spectra
are consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma of a few keV. We
estimate unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of $\gtrsim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$
(0.2-12 keV). Broadband spectral energy distribution modelling, from
near-ultraviolet to infrared, indicates a disc-dominated system consistent with
a nova-like classification. We discuss these results in the context of the
source's confirmed nova-like classification and its possible magnetic nature, a
scenario increasingly supported by discoveries of intermediate polars
exhibiting VY Sculptoris-type nova-like features.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse
supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering
(CEvNS). The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino)
accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of
10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment
required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This
indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to
revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because
the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra
and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights
nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard
neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion
modeling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient signals exhibiting diverse strengths
and emission bandwidths. Traditional single-pulse search techniques are widely
employed for FRB detection; yet weak, narrow-band bursts often remain
undetectable due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in integrated profiles. We
developed DANCE, a detection tool based on cluster analysis of the original
spectrum. It is specifically designed to detect and isolate weak, narrow-band
FRBs, providing direct visual identification of their emission properties. This
method performs density clustering on reconstructed, RFI-cleaned observational
data, enabling the extraction of targeted clusters in time-frequency domain
that correspond to the genuine FRB emission range. Our simulations show that
DANCE successfully extracts all true signals with SNR~>5 and achieves a
detection precision exceeding 93%. Furthermore, through the practical detection
of FRB 20201124A, DANCE has demonstrated a significant advantage in finding
previously undetectable weak bursts, particularly those with distinct
narrow-band features or occurring in proximity to stronger bursts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We report a measurement of the cosmic ray helium energy spectrum in the
energy interval 0.16 -- 13 PeV, derived by subtracting the proton spectrum from
the light component (proton and helium) spectrum obtained with observations
made by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) under a
consistent energy scale. The helium spectrum shows a significant hardening
centered at $E \simeq$ 1.1 PeV, followed by a softening at $\sim$ 7 PeV,
indicating the appearance of a helium `knee'. Comparing the proton and helium
spectra in the LHAASO energy range reveals some remarkable facts. In the lower
part of this range, in contrast to the behavior at lower energies, the helium
spectrum is significantly softer than the proton spectrum. This results in
protons overtaking helium nuclei and becoming the largest cosmic ray component
at $E \simeq$ 0.7 PeV. A second crossing of the two spectra is observed at $E
\simeq$ 5 PeV, above the proton knee, when helium nuclei overtake protons to
become the largest cosmic ray component again. These results have important
implications for our understanding of the Galactic cosmic ray sources.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray from Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is regarded as the most
ideal tool to perform in-situ measurement of cosmic ray (CR) density and
spectra in our Galaxy. We report the first detection of $\gamma$-ray emissions
in the very-high-energy (VHE) domain from the five nearby GMCs with a stacking
analysis based on a 4.5-year $\gamma$-ray observation with the Large High
Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) experiment. The spectral energy
distributions derived from the GMCs are consistent with the expected
$\gamma$-ray flux produced via CR interacting with the ISM in the energy
interval 1 - 100 $~\rm$ TeV. In addition, we investigate the presence of the CR
spectral `knee' by introducing a spectral break in the $\gamma$-ray data. While
no significant evidence for the CR knee is found, the current KM2A measurements
from GMCs strongly favor a proton CR knee located above 0.9$~\rm$ PeV, which is
consistent with the latest measurement of the CR spectrum by ground-based
experiments.

Abstract: We report a long-term, high-cadence timing and spectral observation of the
X-ray pulsar SMC X-1 using NinjaSat, a 6U CubeSat in low-Earth orbit, covering
nearly a full superorbital cycle. SMC X-1 is a high-mass X-ray binary
exhibiting a 0.7 s X-ray pulsar and a non-stationary superorbital modulation
with periods ranging from approximately 40 to 65 days. Its peak luminosity of
$1.3\times10^{39}$~\lumcgs\ makes it a local analogue of ultraluminous X-ray
pulsars powered by supercritical accretion. We find that the spin-up rate
during the high state remains consistent with the long-term average, with no
significant correlation between spin-up rate and flux. This result indicates
that the modulation is primarily geometric rather than accretion-driven. The
hardness ratio and spectral shape are stable throughout the entire superorbital
cycle, supporting obscuration by optically thick material or energy-independent
scattering. In addition, the 2--20 keV pulse profile varies with superorbital
phase, which may be explained either by variable covering fraction due to
geometric obscuration, or by free precession of the neutron star. This
represents the first complete measurement of spin-up rate and spectral
evolution across a single superorbital cycle in SMC X-1, highlighting the
scientific capability of CubeSat-based observatories.

### [13] [Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Energies Using LHAASO Observations of GRB221009A via DisCan Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05062)
*Yu-Chen Hua,Xiao-Jun Bi,Yu-Ming Yang,Peng-Fei Yin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates potential Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) effects using the DisCan algorithm on LHAASO observations of GRB 221009A. Analyses of high-energy photon data from WCDA and KM2A detectors set stringent lower limits on the quantum gravity energy scale at ~10¹⁹ GeV for first-order and ~10¹¹ GeV for second-order scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test predictions of quantum gravity theories that suggest LIV causes energy-dependent light speed, observable as temporal distortions in photons from distant astrophysical sources like GRBs. Previous methods may have been limited, prompting the use of the DisCan algorithm for more accurate searches.

Method: Applied the DisCan algorithm to LHAASO's GRB 221009A data from WCDA (ultra-high energy Cherenkov detector) and KM2A (extensive air shower array). Used Shannon entropy to analyze photon arrival times, considering energy resolution and temporal binning uncertainties across 0.2-13 TeV. Calculated 95% C.L. lower bounds on E_QG for subluminal/superluminal first and second-order LIV scenarios.

Result: Set lower limits: First-order subluminal E_QG > 2.11×10¹⁹ GeV; superluminal >1.38×10¹⁹ GeV. Second-order subluminal E_QG >1.49×10¹¹ GeV; superluminal >1.37×10¹¹ GeV. These represent improved constraints compared to prior studies using other GRBs or experiments.

Conclusion: No evidence for LIV detected in GRB 221009A data within the observed energy range. The results tighten the allowable parameter space for quantum gravity theories predicting LIV, particularly for higher-order effects. Future observations of brighter/farther GRBs could further test these limits.

Abstract: The Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity
theories would manifest as an energy-dependent speed of light, which may
potentially distort the observed temporal profile of photons from astrophysical
sources at cosmological distances. The dispersion cancellation (DisCan)
algorithm offers a powerful methodology for investigating such effects by
employing quantities such as Shannon entropy, which reflects the initial
temporal characteristics. In this study, we apply the DisCan algorithm to
search for LIV effects in the LHAASO observations of GRB 221009A, combining
data from both the WCDA and KM2A detectors that collectively span an energy
range of $\sim 0.2-13$ TeV. Our analysis accounts for the uncertainties from
both energy resolution and temporal binning. We derive $95\%$ confidence level
lower limits on the LIV energy scale of $E_{\rm{QG}}/10^{19}~\text{GeV}>21.1$
(13.8) for the first-order subluminal (superluminal) scenario, and
$E_{\rm{QG}}/10^{11}~\text{GeV}> 14.9$ (13.7) for the second-order subluminal
(superluminal) scenario.

### [14] [Formation of millisecond pulsar-helium star binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05075)
*Zhu-Ling Deng,Xiang-Dong Li,Yong Shao,Ying-Han Mao,Long Jiang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Roche lobe overflow (RLO) accretion before the common envelope (CE) phase influences the spin evolution of neutron stars (NS) in recycled pulsar-helium star binaries. Using stellar evolution and population synthesis codes, the authors show that super-Eddington accretion during RLO can spin NSs to millisecond periods, contributing to their recycling. Calculations also provide estimates for the birthrate and population of such systems in the Galaxy based on CE efficiency parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses uncertainties in the spin period acceleration mechanism of recycled pulsars, particularly the role of pre-CE RLO accretion. Previous studies focused on hypercritical accretion during the CE phase, but the specific mechanism for spin-up remains unclear due to CE's complexity. This paper seeks to clarify how RLO before the CE phase impacts NS spin characteristics.

Method: The authors employed the MESA stellar evolution code and BSE binary population synthesis code to model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. They calculated distributions of orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic field. Parameters included CE efficiency (α_CE between 0.3-3).

Result: RLO accretion prior to CE can spin NSs to millisecond periods via super-Eddington accretion. The Galaxy's birthrate of these systems ranges from 9.0×10^-5 to 1.9×10^-4 yr^-1, with estimated populations of 626-2684 systems depending on α_CE values.

Conclusion: Pre-CE RLO plays a significant role in NS spin-up, challenging the traditional focus on CE-phase hypercritical accretion alone. The findings refine models of binary evolution and pulsar recycling mechanisms, offering new insights into the formation of NS-He star systems.

Abstract: PSR J1928+1815, the first recycled pulsar-helium (He) star binary discovered
by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, consists of a
10.55 ms pulsar and a companion star with mass $1-1.6\,M_{\sun}$ in a 0.15-day
orbit. Theoretical studies suggest that this system originated from a neutron
star (NS) intermediate-mass or high-mass X-ray binary that underwent common
envelope (CE) evolution, leading to the successful ejection of the giant
envelope. The traditional view is that hypercritical accretion during the CE
phase may have recycled the NS. However, the specific mechanism responsible for
accelerating its spin period remains uncertain due to the complex processes
involved in CE evolution.In this study, we investigate the influence of Roche
lobe overflow (RLO) accretion that takes place prior to the CE phase on the
spin evolution of NSs. Our primary objective is to clarify how this process
affects the spin characteristics of pulsars. We utilized the stellar evolution
code \texttt{MESA} and the binary population synthesis code \texttt{BSE} to
model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. We calculated the
distributions of the orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic
field for NS + He star systems in the Galaxy. Our results indicate that RLO
accretion preceding the CE phase could spin up NSs to millisecond periods
through super-Eddington accretion. Considering a range of CE efficiencies
$\alpha_{\rm CE}$ from 0.3 to 3, we estimate the birthrate (total number) of NS
+ He star systems in our Galaxy to be 9.0$\times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ (626
systems) to 1.9$\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2684 systems).

Zafar*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents the analysis of GRB 240419A, noting its high redshift (z=5.178), early optical polarization measurements showing a decreasing polarization from ~7% to ~5% over ~3000 seconds with a stable position angle, and multi-wavelength afterglow characteristics consistent with a forward shock. These observations suggest an ordered magnetic field with large-scale turbulent components, challenging microscopic turbulence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve inconsistencies in past GRB polarization observations and clarify jet magnetic field configurations by studying early polarization in a high-redshift GRB.

Method: The team performed early-time polarimetry (three epochs) and multi-wavelength monitoring (X-ray to near-IR) of GRB 240419A's afterglow. They analyzed polarization evolution and light curve features.

Result: Measured polarization levels decreased from 6.97% to 4.81% with stable position angle. Afterglow linked to forward shock dominance, suggesting ordered magnetic fields plus large-scale turbulence. No jet break observed limits comparisons to some theoretical models.

Conclusion: The stable polarization signature indicates magnetic field order influenced by large-scale MHD instabilities, not microscopic turbulence. Further polarization studies are needed to fully characterize jet dynamics.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely bright phenomena powered by
relativistic jets arising from explosive events at cosmological distances. The
nature of the jet and the configuration of the local magnetic fields are still
unclear, with the distinction between different models possibly provided by the
detection of early-time polarisation. Past observations do not agree on a
universal scenario describing early-time polarisation in GRB afterglows, and
new studies are necessary to investigate this open question. We present here
the discovery of GRB\,240419A, its redshift determination of $z=5.178$, its
early-time optical polarimetry observations, and the multi-wavelength
monitoring of its afterglow. We analysed three epochs of polarimetric data to
derive the early-time evolution of the polarisation. The multi-wavelength light
curve from the X-rays to the near-infrared band was also investigated to give a
broader perspective on the whole event. We find a high level of polarisation,
$P=6.97^{+1.84}_{-1.52}$\,\%, at 1740~s after the GRB trigger, followed by a
slight decrease up to $P=4.81^{+1.87}_{-1.53}$\,\% at 3059~s. On the same
timescale, the polarisation position angle is nearly constant. The multi-band
afterglow at the time of the polarisation measurements is consistent with a
forward shock (FS), while the earlier evolution at $t-t_0\lesssim700$ s can be
associated with the interplay between the forward and the reverse shocks or
with energy injection. The detected polarised radiation when the afterglow is
FS-dominated and the stable position angle are consistent with an ordered
magnetic field plus a turbulent component driven by large-scale
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. The lack of a jet break in the light curve
prevents a comparison of the polarisation temporal evolution with theoretical
expectations from magnetic fields amplified by microscopic-scale turbulence,

Abstract: The detection of GW231123, a gravitational-wave (GW) event with exceptionally
massive and rapidly spinning black holes, suggests the possible formation
within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, which provides a favorable
environment for potentially generating an observable electromagnetic (EM)
counterpart. We conduct a search for such a counterpart by crossmatching the GW
localization with a comprehensive catalog of AGN flares from the Zwicky
Transient Facility. Our analysis yields six plausible optical flare candidates
that are spatially and temporally coincident with GW231123 and exhibit
significant deviations from their AGN baseline flux. Although these candidates
represent a crucial first step, their true nature remains inconclusive.
Confirming any one of these flares via future observations would provide a
landmark validation of the AGN formation channel and unlock the multi-messenger
potential of this extraordinary merger.

### [17] [A Mass-Independent Damping Timescale in Black Hole Accretion Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05268)
*Haoyang Zhang,Shenbang Yang,Li Zhang,Benzhong Dai*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates long-term hard X-ray variability in black hole and neutron star systems using Swift data, finding characteristic damping timescales (CDTs) independent of black hole mass, which challenges existing scaling laws. This is linked to disk-corona interactions via thermal conduction, suggesting a role in jet modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underlying structure of accretion disks and understand deviations from existing scaling laws by analyzing long-term X-ray variability across diverse accretion systems.

Method: Analyzing 157-month Swift/BAT light curves of 39 Seyfert galaxies, 17 blazars, 82 X-ray binaries, and one tidal disruption event using a damped random walk model to measure CDTs.

Result: CDTs ranged from months to years and showed mass independence, contradicting expected scaling relationships. This was attributed to conductive timescales from disk-corona interactions influencing jet emission.

Conclusion: Thermal conduction in disk-corona interactions drives hard X-ray variability, providing evidence for a connection between disk, corona, and jets, challenging previous assumptions about accretion disk dynamics.

Abstract: The scaling laws reveal the underlying structural similarities shared by
astrophysical systems across vastly different scales. In black hole accretion
systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales
(CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the
underlying physical structure of accretion disks. We investigate, for the first
time, the long-term hard X-ray variability of black hole and neutron star
accretion systems using light curves from the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert
Telescope 157-month catalog. Applying a damped random walk model, we measure
CDTs for 39 Seyfert galaxies, 17 blazars, 82 X-ray binaries, and one tidal
disruption event. Unexpectedly, these CDTs span months to years but with a
mass-independent feature, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This
puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from
disk--corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes
characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in
blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving
hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the
disk--corona--jet connection.

Abstract: The IceCube Observatory comprises a cubic-kilometer particle detector deep in
the Antarctic ice and the cosmic-ray air-shower array IceTop at the surface
above. Previous analyses of the cosmic-ray composition have used coincident
events with IceTop detecting the electromagnetic shower footprint as well as
GeV muons, while the sensors submerged in the ice measure the TeV muons from
the same events. The energy range of previous composition analyses, however,
has been limited to 3 PeV primary energy and above, whereas the IceTop
all-particle energy spectrum has been extended down to 250 TeV. This
contribution presents a method to reconstruct the combined spectrum of
cosmic-ray protons and helium nuclei, starting at 200 TeV primary energy. The
resulting H+He spectrum closes the gap in the measurements of light cosmic rays
between IceCube as well as KASCADE and experiments measuring in the TeV energy
range, such as DAMPE and HAWC.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of massive, rapidly spinning binary black
holes mergers provide increasing evidence for the dynamical origin of some
mergers. Previous studies have interpreted the mergers with primary mass
$\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ as being dominated by hierarchical, second-generation
mergers, with rapidly spinning primaries being the products of previous black
hole mergers assembled in dense stellar clusters. In this work, we reveal
confident evidence of another subpopulation with rapid and isotropic spins at
low mass containing the two exceptional events GW241011 and GW241110,
consistent with a hierarchical merger hypothesis. Our result suggests the mass
distribution of the second-generation black holes is peaked at low primary
masses of $\sim16\,M_\odot$ rather than $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ in the
pair-instability gap. Such low-mass second-generation black holes must be
formed from the merger of even lighter first-generation black holes, implying
that dense, metal-rich stellar environments contribute to the binary black hole
population. By separating the contamination of higher-generation black holes,
our result reveals the primary mass distribution of first-generation black
holes formed from stellar collapse, which shows a significant dip between
$\sim12\,M_\odot$ to $\sim20\,M_\odot$. This may indicate a dearth of black
holes due to variation in the core compactness of the progenitor.

TL;DR: DAMPE satellite observations reveal charge-dependent spectral softenings in cosmic ray nuclei (carbon, oxygen, iron) at ~15 TV rigidity, consistent with acceleration limits from a nearby source and confirming theoretical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To observationally verify the charge-dependent maximum energy limit in cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms, which was previously unconfirmed due to measurement challenges.

Method: Analysis of 9 years of DAMPE data to measure spectra of carbon, oxygen, iron, and updated proton/helium spectra, detecting universal spectral softenings at ~15 TV. Also examined large-scale anisotropies for correlations.

Result: First direct detection of distinct spectral softenings in heavy nuclei spectra; softening occurs universally at ~15 TV rigidity with no mass dependence (p>99.999%). Correlated anisotropy structures observed.

Conclusion: Spectral softenings indicate nearby cosmic ray source with acceleration limits (Peters cycle), providing first observational confirmation of charge-dependent cosmic ray energy limits predicted theoretically.

Abstract: In most particle acceleration mechanisms, the maximum energy of the cosmic
rays can achieve is charge dependent. However, the observational verification
of such a fundamental relation is still lack due to the difficulty of measuring
the spectra of individual particles from one (kind of) source(s) up to very
high energies. This work reports direct measurements of the carbon, oxygen, and
iron spectra from ~ 20 gigavolts to ~ 100 teravolts (~ 60 teravolts for iron)
with 9 years of on-orbit data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer
(DAMPE). Distinct spectral softenings have been directly detected in these
spectra for the first time. Combined with the updated proton and helium
spectra, the spectral softening appears universally at a rigidity of ~ 15
teravolts. A nuclei mass dependent softening is rejected at a confidence level
of > 99.999%. Taking into account the correlated structures at similar energies
in the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays, one of the most natural
interpretations of the spectral structures is the presence of a nearby cosmic
ray source. In this case, the softening energies correspond to the acceleration
upper limits of such a source, forming the so-called Peters cycle of the
spectra. The results thus offer observational verification of the long-standing
prediction of the charge-dependent energy limit of cosmic ray acceleration.

*A. Pasetto,O. Vilchis,A. Bonafede,E. F. Jiménez-Andrade,K. Rajpurohit,E. Murphy*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study presents high-frequency VLA radio data of the MACS J0717.5+3745 relic, revealing a change in magneto-ionic structure compared to low-frequency observations. This suggests internal depolarization linked to re-acceleration of fossil particles from AGN jets, potentially reshaping understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms in relics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether radio relics originate from accelerated thermal electrons or fossil particles influenced by merger shocks, and to provide observational support for theoretical models via spectropolarimetry.

Method: High-frequency (X-band) VLA radio observations analyzing polarized QU-fitting spectropolarimetry of MACS J0717.5+3745, comparing data with existing lower-frequency records.

Result: Observed structural differences in polarized emission between high and low frequencies, indicating possible internal depolarization and evidence of particle re-acceleration by AGN jet fossils within the relic's environment.

Conclusion: High-frequency spectropolarimetric data are critical for tracing shock fronts and investigating magneto-ionic properties, urging further exploration of such data to refine acceleration models in cluster mergers.

Abstract: We present high-frequency, full-polarisation Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
radio data at X-band of the radio relic: MACS J0717.5+3745. Radio relics trace
shock waves in the intracluster medium (ICM) produced during mergers.
Understanding the physical characteristics of relics is important for
determining their nature, whether for example they are thermal ICM electrons
that are accelerated, or whether they are fossil electrons re-accelerated by a
merger event. Radio spectropolarimetric analysis, such as the Stokes
QU-fitting, provides a diagnostic of the nature and structure of the magnetized
plasma internal or external to the source, with important implications for
theoretical models. The high-frequency polarisation analysis presented here
shows, for the first time, a change in the magneto-ionic structure compared to
the low-frequency data available in the literature. These high-frequency,
polarised data could be interpreted also with an internal depolarisation
behaviour and this new finding may be used to investigate possible particle
acceleration mechanism. If that is true, the change in the behaviour of the
polarised signal could be tracing physical properties of a population of
non-thermal particles that are undergoing to a re-acceleration of particles in
the relic by large-scale internal shocks of Active Galactic Nuclei jet fossil
particles ejected from the central Narrow Angle Tail radio galaxy. New upcoming
broad-band VLA X- and Ku-bands data will clarify this. Finally, we conclude
that high-frequency, high-sensitive, spectropolarimetric radio data should be
explored further, as they can effectively trace shock fronts and thereby
provide insights into the intrinsic magneto-ionic properties of radio
components.

Abstract: Several gamma ray bursts have recently been associated with a kilonova
emission. We study the mechanisms which could account for this effect, by means
of radioactive decay of elements synthesized in accretion disk wind. We model
the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated
with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a
GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from
post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial
parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary
merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General
Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of
state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the
accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the
leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial
rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values
of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of
large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen
gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle
trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements
in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We
find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with
mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE
mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass
ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning
black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and
also be the sites of efficient nucleosynthesis of Lanthanides.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the reconstruction of a new agegraphic dark energy
model in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime by $f(Q)$ gravity
framework, where $Q$ represents non-metricity. We assume that the scale factor
follows a power-law and explore how this model aligns with the expanding
universe. In this perspective, we develop a new agegraphic $f(Q)$ model and
analyze the graphical behavior for cosmic evolution. We analyze physical
characteristics of the model using the equation of state parameter,
$(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$ and the $(r-s)$ planes. The equation of
state parameter indicates a quintessence era characterized by accelerated
expansion. The $(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$-plane identifies the freezing
region and the Chaplygin gas model is represented in the $(r-s)$-plane.
Finally, we examine the stability of the non-interacting model by evaluating
the squared speed of sound. Our findings show that the non-interacting new
agegraphic dark energy model effectively resolves the cosmic coincidence
problem.

Abstract: Applications of effective field theory (EFT) and scattering amplitudes to
gravitational problems have recently produced many unique results that advanced
our understanding of the dynamics of compact binaries. Many of these results
were made possible by comparing gravitational scattering amplitudes in EFT with
exact expressions from general relativity. However, the latter expressions are
not easily available as they require intricate solution techniques for the
Teukolsky master equation, such as the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. In
this paper, we develop and present the first public package that enables
computations of gravitational scattering amplitudes in black hole perturbation
theory within the MST framework. Our package supports both analytic
computations to a given post-Minkowskian (PM) order in the low-frequency limit
and exact numerical computations for an arbitrary frequency of the perturbing
field. As an application, we compute scattering phase shifts and inelasticity
parameters for massless spin - 0, 1, and 2 fields resulting from scattering off
a rotating Kerr black hole through the third PM order and compare these results
with the exact numerical solutions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of expanding and twisting solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of type D where the Faraday tensor's null eigendirections aren't aligned with the Weyl tensor's PNDs. These solutions depend on six parameters and can be specialized to known cases like the Kerr-Newman metric.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize existing solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations by exploring scenarios where Faraday tensor eigendirections aren't aligned with Weyl tensor principal null directions (PNDs), enabling new physical insights and parameterizations.

Method: Derived novel solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations under specified algebraic conditions (type D), explored their metric forms and parameterizations, including six physical parameters, and demonstrated reduction to known cases like Kerr-Newman in static limits.

Result: Constructed a six-parameter solution framework compatible with previous cases (Kerr-Newman), validated through reductions to known metrics under specific limits, and provided new parameterizations.

Conclusion: The work expands our understanding of exact solutions in Einstein-Maxwell systems, offers a comprehensive parameterized model for further exploration of electromagnetic fields coupled with spacetime geometries, and unifies previously studied special cases under a single framework.

Abstract: We present a new class of expanding and twisting solutions to the
Einstein-Maxwell equations of algebraic type D, where the null eigendirections
of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with PNDs of the Weyl tensor. After
deriving this novel solution, we explore its various metric forms and
parameterizations. In suitable coordinates, the solution depends on six
physical parameters, namely mass $m$, Kerr and NUT twist parameters $a$ and
$l$, complex charge $c$, acceleration $\alpha$, and parameter $\beta$ that
governs the interplay between electric and magnetic charges in the aligned part
of the Faraday tensor. This parameterization, as the Griffiths-Podolsk\'{y}
form of the Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski solution, facilitates explicit special
subcases, such as Kerr-Newman black holes, and a deeper physical
interpretation. Additionally, in the static limit, our solution reduces to
previously known cases.

Specifically, pulsar timing arrays could detect PBHs from asteroid to dwarf planet masses via dipolar timing signals, while planetary mass PBHs might produce detectable accretion flares from Kuiper Belt interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new observational methods for detecting PBHs in mass ranges still unconstrained by conventional cosmological probes, leveraging the high precision of Solar System observations.

Method: 1. Using pulsar timing arrays to detect dipolar timing variations caused by PBHs in asteroid-to-dwarf planet mass ranges. 2. Analyzing accretion flares from planetary mass PBH interactions with Kuiper Belt objects through ADAF models.

Result: Demonstrates that these methods can probe PBH masses (10^18 kg to 10^24 kg) currently unexplored by other observations, offering complementary constraints.

Conclusion: Solar System-scale searches provide a novel frontier for PBH detection, especially in mass ranges where existing cosmological methods are limited, emphasizing the need for multi-messenger astrophysics approaches.

Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) represent one of the more interesting ways to
address dark matter, at the interface of both cosmology and quantum gravity. It
is no surprise then that testing PBHs is a venue of active interest, with
several cosmological and astrophysical probes constraining different mass
ranges. In this work, we propose novel Solar System scale searches for PBHs,
motivated by the unique precision and coverage of local observables. We show
that asteroid to dwarf planet mass PBHs can induce measurable dipolar timing
signatures in pulsar timing arrays, while planetary mass PBHs can generate
detectable ADAF accretion flares through interactions with Kuiper Belt bodies.
Together, these complementary approaches open a new observational frontier for
probing PBHs across mass ranges that remain unconstrained by conventional
cosmological methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how modified gravity models in higher dimensions (D=8) can explain inflationary observables and validate their consistency with experimental data and de Sitter conjectures within the quantum gravity Landscape framework.

Method: Derive potentials for single-field and two-field scenarios using $R+	heta R^n$ gravity, compute scalar-to-tensor ratio, spectral index, running index, and scalar amplitude. Compare results with observational data. Apply de Sitter conjectures to assess Landscape compatibility.

Result: The models' predicted observables align with experimental constraints, supporting their validity. Analysis of de Sitter conjectures suggests potential placement within the quantum gravity Landscape depending on parameter choices.

Conclusion: Modified D=8 gravity models provide viable inflationary frameworks consistent with observations and offer insights into the theoretical Landscape structure via de Sitter conjecture tests.

Abstract: In this work, we study two potentials, the single-field and the two-field,
from the modified ($R+\gamma R^n$) gravity in D=8 dimensions. From those
potentials, we calculate four observable quantities in inflation, including
scalar-to-tensor ratio, spectral index, running index and scalar amplitude.
Then, we compare them to the experimental data to verify the righteousness of
the models. Last but not least, de Sitter conjectures are brought up with these
two potentials to investigate that it is possible or not the theory lay in the
Landscape of quantum gravity.

### [29] [The tidal response of a relativistic star](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05139)
*Nils Andersson,Rhys Counsell,Fabian Gittins,Suprovo Ghosh*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents a fully relativistic approach to calculate the tidal response of compact stars by matching interior fluid dynamics with exterior spacetime perturbations, avoiding quasi-normal mode sums. It validates the method with realistic equations of state and connects it to field-theory scattering amplitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling relativistic tides in compact stars without relying on quasi-normal mode sums, which has hindered previous approaches.

Method: The method involves matching linearised fluid solutions in the star's interior with near-zone spacetime perturbations, identifying tidal driving and response. It leverages the exactness in Newtonian gravity and extends to relativistic regimes. Numerical tests use BSk equations of state with composition stratification.

Result: Proof-of-principle numerical results show the method's viability with realistic equations of state, including low-frequency gravity modes. The approach's robustness is demonstrated beyond Newtonian cases. Connections to field-theory scattering amplitudes are outlined.

Conclusion: The developed approach offers a robust framework for relativistic tidal interactions in compact stars, overcoming prior limitations and opening avenues for future model development using scattering amplitude techniques.

Abstract: We develop a fully relativistic approach for determining the
frequency-dependent tidal response of a compact star. The strategy involves
matching the solution for the linearised fluid dynamics in the star's interior
to the spacetime perturbations in the near-zone surrounding the body, along
with an identification of the tidal driving and the star's response. Notably,
this identification is exact in Newtonian gravity and we provide strong
evidence that it remains robust also in the relativistic case. The argument
does not involve a sum over the star's quasinormal modes and hence circumvents
one of the obstacles that have held up the development of models for
relativistic tides. Numerical results are provided, at the proof-of-principle
level, for a realistic matter equation of state from the BSk family, including
composition stratification leading to the presence of low-frequency gravity
modes. We also sketch the connection with the field-theory inspired approach to
the problem, in which the tidal response is expressed in terms of asymptotic
scattering amplitudes.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes linear cosmological perturbations in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity using a covariant and gauge-invariant approach, deriving equations for scalar, vector, and tensor modes under radiation and dust conditions. The study identifies potential modifications to density contrast, vorticity, and tensor propagation compared to General Relativity, highlighting testable signatures against cosmological observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity modifications on cosmological perturbations, providing a testable framework that extends beyond General Relativity and can be validated with CMB and large-scale structure data.

Method: The authors use the 1+3 covariant formalism to derive exact propagation equations for scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations in FLRW backgrounds. They analyze two specific subclasses involving higher-order density terms and modified equation-of-state parameters/sound speeds.

Result: Key results include altered density contrasts depending on coupling parameters/wavelength, early-time vorticity retention in vectors, and damped tensor modes with variable effective masses. All results smoothly transition to General Relativity as the coupling parameter η approaches zero.

Conclusion: The framework establishes observable signatures like scalar tilts, tensor damping modifications, and changed vorticity behavior as crucial tests for Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity, offering a pathway to constrain alternative gravity theories via cosmological observations.

Abstract: We present a fully covariant and gauge-invariant analysis of linear
cosmological perturbations in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity. Working within
the 1+3 formalism, we derive the exact propagation equations for scalar,
vector, and tensor modes on FLRW backgrounds, in the case of radiation and
dust. Two representative subclasses are examined in detail, in which
non-linearity enters through $\mathcal{O}(\eta\rho^2)$ corrections or
modifications in the equation-of-state parameter and the sound speed. For
scalar perturbations, the density contrast can be enhanced or reduced relative
to General Relativity, depending on the coupling parameter and the wavelength
regime. A similar behaviour occurs for vector modes, allowing for a non-trivial
vorticity at early-times. Tensor modes, described by the magnetic part of the
Weyl tensor and the shear tensor propagate as damped waves with slowly varying
effective masses. All sectors reduce continuously to their GR limits as
$\eta\!\to\!0$. The framework isolates robust signatures - early-time scalar
tilts, tensor damping shifts, and altered vorticity decay - that can be
confronted with CMB and large-scale-structure observations to constrain these
theories of gravity.

Abstract: This work investigates the temporal distribution of glitches detected by
LIGO, focusing on the morphological classification provided by the Gravity Spy
project. Starting from the hypothesis that these events follow a Poisson
process, we developed a statistical methodology to evaluate the agreement
between the empirical distribution of glitches and an ideal Poisson model,
using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as the main metric. The analysis
was applied to real data from the LIGO detectors in Livingston and Hanford
throughout the O3 run, as well as to synthetic datasets generated from pure
Poisson distributions. The results show that while several morphologies exhibit
good agreement with the proposed model, classes such as 1400Ripples, Fast
Scattering, and Power Line display significant deviations ($R^2 \leq 0.6$),
suggesting that their origins do not strictly follow Poissonian statistics. In
some cases, a dependence on the detector or the observing run was also
observed. This analysis provides a quantitative basis for distinguishing glitch
classes based on their degree of "Poissonness", potentially supporting the
development of more effective glitch mitigation strategies in gravitational
wave detector data.

*Guadalupe Ahumada Acuña,Cecilia Bejarano,Rafael Ferraro*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores Born-Infeld electrogravity, a unified framework combining gravity and electromagnetism via a determinantal Lagrangian. Using Palatini formalism, it derives field equations showing the gravitational sector aligns with Einstein's equations under torsion-free conditions. The electromagnetic sector reveals two viewpoints: standard Born-Infeld in modified geometry or anomalous theory in physical metric. Analysis of dyonic solutions shows this theory partially mitigates but doesn't resolve spacetime singularities like Reissner-Nordström.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify gravity and electromagnetism within a single theoretical framework, addressing issues like singularity and divergence present in standard Reissner-Nordström solutions under general relativity.

Method: Derivation of field equations using Palatini formalism where metric, connection, and vector potential are varied independently. Analysis of spherically symmetric dyonic solutions to compare with Reissner-Nordström geometry.

Result: Gravitational sector reduces to Einstein's equations with torsion-free connection. Electromagnetic sector allows two equivalent interpretations showing Born-Infeld dynamics. Dyonic solutions indicate curvature singularities persist but are softened compared to Reissner-Nordström.

Conclusion: Born-Infeld electrogravity offers a partial improvement over classical electromagnetism in curved spacetime but does not resolve geodesic incompleteness. Future work may explore extent of singularity mitigation in other contexts.

Abstract: Born-Infeld electrogravity is defined through a Lagrangian that couples
gravity and electromagnetism within a single determinantal structure. The field
equations are derived in Palatini's formalism, where the metric, connection,
and vector potential are varied independently in the action. As a result, the
gravitational sector reduces to Einstein's equations with a torsion-free,
metric-compatible connection. The electrodynamic sector, in turn, admits two
equivalent interpretations or $pictures$: it can be seen either as a standard
Born-Infeld electrodynamics in an effective background geometry, or as an
$anomalous$ Born-Infeld electrodynamics in the physical metric. We illustrate
the dynamics by analyzing the horizon structure and extremality conditions of
spherically symmetric dyonic solutions. A comparison with the
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometry shows that Born-Infeld electrogravity softens
but does not eliminate curvature divergences, and geodesic incompleteness
persists.

### [33] [The $\boldsymbol{r^{-3}}$ Curvature Decay and the Infrared Structure of Linearized Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05345)
*Michael Wilson*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper establishes a curvature decay rate of r^{-3} as a critical threshold in linearized gravity on asymptotically flat manifolds, separating dispersive behavior from infrared phenomena like gravitational memory. Analytical and numerical studies show the essential spectrum transitions at p=3 in the radial model, aligning with non-Abelian gauge theory results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how curvature decay rates influence the spectral properties of the spatial Lichnerowicz operator, which determines the nature of gravitational wave behavior and soft graviton phenomena.

Method: Analytical analysis of the spatial Lichnerowicz operator's spectrum under different curvature decay assumptions, complemented by numerical solutions of a radial model differential equation. The study tracks how essential spectrum components (σ_ess) change with decay rate parameter p.

Result: A sharp spectral transition occurs exactly at p=3 (r^{-3} decay): for p>3, spectrum is [0,∞) with free radiation modes; at p=3, zero energy included causing marginally bound states. Numerics confirm eigenvalue trends align with analytical predictions, showing smooth transition but no discrete confinement.

Conclusion: The inverse-cube curvature decay marks a universal infrared threshold for gravitational and gauge fields, governing the emergence of memory effects and soft modes. This unifies gravitational and non-Abelian field behaviors through a shared r^{-3} scaling law.

Abstract: We identify curvature decay $|\mathrm{Riem}| \sim r^{-3}$ as a sharp spectral
threshold in linearized gravity on asymptotically flat manifolds. For faster
decay, the spatial Lichnerowicz operator possesses a purely continuous spectrum
$\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(L) = [0,\infty)$, corresponding to freely radiating
tensor modes. At the inverse-cube rate, compactness fails and zero energy
enters $\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(L)$, yielding marginally bound, finite-energy
configurations that remain spatially extended. These static modes constitute
the linear precursors of gravitational memory and soft-graviton phenomena,
delineating the geometric boundary between dispersive and infrared behavior. A
complementary numerical study of the radial model \[ L_p = -\frac{d^2}{dr^2} +
\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2} + \frac{C}{r^p} \] confirms the analytic scaling law,
locating the same transition at $p = 3$. The eigenvalue trends approach the
flat-space limit continuously for $p > 3$ and strengthen progressively for $p <
3$, demonstrating a smooth yet sharp spectral transition rather than a discrete
confinement regime. The result parallels the critical threshold of the
non-Abelian covariant Laplacian~[18], indicating a common $r^{-3}$ scaling that
governs the infrared structure of gauge and gravitational fields.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved algorithm and open-source c++ code (NuFast-Earth) to efficiently compute neutrino oscillation probabilities in varying Earth matter potentials, optimizing calculations for future experiments like DUNE and HyperK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing computational demands of neutrino experiments with atmospheric, solar, and supernova neutrinos necessitate faster and more flexible algorithms to handle sharply varying matter potentials, such as those encountered in Earth's varying density profiles.

Method: Expands on previous long-baseline algorithms to accommodate arbitrary Earth density models using two schemes. The code 'NuFast-Earth' caches results to avoid redundant calculations, enhancing speed. It supports both MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) effect scenarios and varying density layers.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates significant computational speed-up while maintaining accuracy, particularly useful for large-scale simulations required by upcoming neutrino detectors like DUNE and HyperK.

Conclusion: NuFast-Earth provides a robust, efficient tool for neutrino oscillation studies in complex matter environments, facilitating advancements in neutrino physics with next-generation experiments.

Abstract: Algorithms for computing neutrino oscillation probabilities in sharply
varying matter potentials such as the Earth are becoming increasingly
important. As the next generation of experiments, DUNE and HyperK as well as
the IceCube upgrade and KM3NeT, come online, the computational cost for
atmospheric and solar neutrinos will continue to increase. To address these
issues, we expand upon our previous algorithm for long-baseline calculations to
efficiently handle probabilities through the Earth for atmospheric, nighttime
solar, and supernova neutrinos. The algorithm is fast, flexible, and accurate.
It can handle arbitrary Earth models with two different schemes for varying
density profiles. We also provide a c++ implementation of the code called
NuFast-Earth along with a detailed user manual. The code intelligently keeps
track of repeated calculations and only recalculates what is needed on each
successive call which can also help provide significant speed-ups.

Method: Chiral effective field theory combined with advanced many-body techniques is used to calculate neutron star properties. This approach integrates nuclear physics principles to model dense matter conditions found in neutron stars.

Result: The analysis provides a framework to correlate neutron star properties (e.g., mass-radius relations, equations of state) with nuclear forces derived from QCD. It highlights neutron stars as probes of physics beyond standard nuclear models.

Conclusion: Using neutron stars as astrophysical laboratories, this method bridges nuclear physics and astrophysics, offering a pathway to discover new physics through observations of these compact objects.

Abstract: There is an increasing interest in the community for the Neutron Stars and
what we can learn from them. In this review we show how chiral effective field

connect Neutron Star properties at zero temperature to nuclear physics and
allows to use these compact objects as laboratories of new physics.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper updates the determination of the effective number of relativistic neutrino species (Neff) and the current entropy density using a momentum-averaged approach, improving computational efficiency and accuracy. It incorporates various factors like electron mass dependence, finite temperature QED corrections, neutrino oscillations, and effective chemical potentials. The method's results differ by less than 0.04% from momentum-dependent solutions and is extendable to BSM scenarios with provided tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance precision in cosmological determinations of Neff using advanced numerical methods, ensuring compatibility with upcoming CMB and BBN data. The motivation is to provide a flexible, computationally efficient framework that can adapt to future new physics scenarios.

Method: The method employs a momentum-averaged approach for neutrino decoupling, integrating collision terms with full electron mass dependence, finite temperature QED corrections, neutrino oscillations, and effective chemical potentials. It revisits all aspects of this approach to ensure accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: The approach achieves results differing by <0.04% from momentum-dependent solutions. A computational tool (nudec_BSM_v2) in Mathematica/Python is provided, compatible with BBN codes, enabling application to beyond-standard-model scenarios.

Conclusion: The momentum-averaged method offers a robust, fast alternative for Neff calculations, crucial for precise cosmological analyses. The released code facilitates integration into existing frameworks, setting groundwork for Part II exploring BSM applications.

Abstract: Cosmological determinations of the number of relativistic neutrino species,
$N^{ }_{\rm eff}$, are becoming increasingly accurate, and further improvements
are expected both from CMB and BBN data. Given this context, we update the
evaluation of $N^{ }_{\rm eff}$ and the current entropy density via the
momentum-averaged approach. This allows for a numerically fast description of
neutrino decoupling, easily portable to an array of new physics scenarios. We
revisit all aspects of this approach, including collision terms with full
electron mass dependence, finite temperature QED corrections to the equation of
state, neutrino oscillations, and the modelling of neutrino ensembles with
effective chemical potentials. For integrated observables, our results differ
by less than $0.04\%$ from the solution of the momentum-dependent evolution
equation. We outline how to extend the approach to BSM settings, and will
highlight its power in Part II. To facilitate the practical implementation, we
release a Mathematica and Python code within nudec_BSM_v2, easily linkable to
BBN codes.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that using spinor-helicity formalism significantly simplifies the calculation of S-matrix elements for the quark-antiquark annihilation process q q̄ → q q̄ g mediated by photons and gluons, without considering Z boson contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precision calculations in high-energy hadronic processes, which are essential for both understanding Standard Model phenomena and detecting new physics. The spinor-helicity method is highlighted for its efficiency in simplifying S-matrix element computations.

Method: The authors compute S-matrix elements for the process q q̄ → q q̄ g, mediated by photons and gluons, by applying the spinor-helicity formalism. They exclude Z boson exchange to streamline calculations.

Result: The calculations show that the spinor-helicity approach greatly reduces the complexity of the computations compared to traditional methods when evaluating these specific scattering processes.

Conclusion: The spinor-helicity formalism is an effective and efficient tool for simplifying calculations of high-energy processes like q q̄ → q q̄ g, particularly when Z boson contributions are negligible. This method enhances precision in theoretical predictions and aids in future collider studies.

Abstract: Precision calculations in hadronic processes at high energy colliders are
crucial for improving the understanding of the standard phenomena as well as
for the discovery of new physics. Spinor-helicity formalism serves as one of
the most efficient ways to simplify the calculations of $S$ matrix elements. In
this article, we compute the $S$ matrix elements for the process
$q\Bar{q}\rightarrow q\Bar{q}g$ mediated by photon and gluon. Ignoring the
contribution of $Z$ boson exchange, we show that the calculation of $S$ matrix
elements for this process simplifies to a great extent by using spinor-helicity
formalism.

### [39] [Millicharged Particle Production in Pulsars via the Schwinger Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04763)
*Chris Kouvaris,Ian M. Shoemaker*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the production and detection of low-mass, millicharged particles in pulsar polar gaps via the Schwinger effect, showing that XENONnT data constrains their charge to below ~1e-6 for sub-eV masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore mechanisms for producing and detecting millicharged particles in astrophysical contexts, leveraging pulsar environments and terrestrial experiments to set observational constraints.

Method: The authors calculate production rates of millicharged particles in pulsar polar gaps using Schwinger pair-production formalism, model their acceleration to MeV energies, and simulate detectability in low-threshold experiments like XENONnT.

Result: Analysis of XENONnT data excludes millicharged particles with charges above ~1e-6 for sub-eV masses if produced in the Crab pulsar's environment.

Conclusion: Direct detection experiments can effectively constrain astrophysically produced millicharged particles, offering a new method to probe beyond-Standard-Model particles using pulsar systems as laboratories.

Abstract: Low mass particles with small electric charges can be produced abundantly in
large electric fields via the Schwinger effect. We study the production rate of
such particles inside the polar gap of nearby pulsars. After production they
are accelerated above MeV energies by the local electric fields. These
pulsar-produced millicharged particles can be detected at Earth in
low-threshold dark matter direct detection experiments. We find that the
current XENONnT data constrains millicharged particles produced in the Crab
pulsar to have charges less than $O(10^{-6})$ for sub-eV masses.

### [40] [Interpretation of LHC excesses at 95 GeV and 152 GeV in an extended Georgi-Machacek model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04796)

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes excesses in Higgs-boson search data at 95 and 152 GeV with the minimally extended Georgi-Machacek (meGM) model, showing it naturally explains these signals through specific particle interactions and couplings while maintaining electroweak precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the observed three-sigma excesses in di-photon and b-bbar channels at CMS/ATLAS and LEP, and explore the meGM model's potential validity and testability.

Method: The meGM model is applied to fit the excesses using four key features: light scalar mass predictions, doubly charged Higgs effects on di-photon rates, asymmetric WW/ZZ couplings from custodial symmetry breaking, and preservation of the rho parameter. Numerical analysis fits the 95/152 GeV excesses and predicts additional light scalars.

Result: The meGM model successfully accounts for the excesses, improves the fit for 152 GeV when explaining 95 GeV signals, and predicts testable CP-odd/charged scalars. Sensitivity studies suggest future LHC and e+e- colliders can probe these predictions.

Conclusion: The meGM model offers a viable framework to explain observed Higgs excesses and motivates targeted searches at upcoming collider experiments.

Abstract: We analyze the excesses at 95 GeV in the light Higgs-boson searches in the
di-photon decay channel reported by CMS and ATLAS, which combined are at the
level of three standard deviations and are compatible with the excess in the
$b\bar{b}$ final state observed at LEP, together with an excess in the
di-photon channel at around 152 GeV reported based on a sideband analysis. We
demonstrate that these excesses can be well described in a minimally extended
Georgi-Machacek (meGM) model. This is enabled by four key features of the meGM
model: (1) a natural prediction for scalar boson masses of $\lesssim$200 GeV
arising from the condition to describe both the Higgs boson signal at 125 GeV
and the excesses at 95 GeV, (2) the prediction for a doubly charged Higgs boson
that can potentially enhance the di-photon decay rates, (3) asymmetric $WW$ and
$ZZ$ couplings to neutral scalar bosons that are induced by mild custodial
symmetry breaking, and (4) the approximate preservation of the electroweak
$\rho$ parameter to be 1 at tree level. We show in our numerical analysis that
the meGM model naturally improves the fit to the LHC data around 152 GeV when
describing the excesses at 95 GeV. At the same time, the model also predicts
additional light CP-odd and charged scalar bosons that can be potentially
probed in future experiments, which motivates dedicated searches in the
upcoming LHC runs. We also present the results of sensitivity studies for the
95 and 125 GeV Higgs-boson couplings at the HL-LHC and future $e^+e^-$
colliders, which demonstrate very interesting prospects for probing the meGM
model at future colliders.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes inclusive B-meson decay rates in the Mesogenesis framework using the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) up to dimension-six terms. It finds regions where subleading terms surpass the leading contribution, indicating HQE limitations. Updated bounds on exclusive decays and lifetime ratios are provided, showing no new constraints beyond collider limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the validity of the HQE in BSM scenarios like Mesogenesis, understand parameter regions where power corrections dominate, and refine decay rate predictions for exclusive modes and lifetime ratios.

Method: Applying HQE to calculate B-meson decay rates in Mesogenesis framework, incorporating up to dimension-six Darwin terms. Systematically evaluates power-suppressed contributions and their impact on decay rates and lifetime ratios.

Result: Identified parameter regions where subleading terms exceed leading contributions, signifying HQE breakdown. Updated lower bounds on B+→p+ψ using HQE-corrected widths. No new constraints found from Bs/Bd lifetime ratios beyond existing collider bounds.

Conclusion: Highlights HQE limitations in Mesogenesis and its applicability boundaries. Emphasizes the necessity of precise theoretical frameworks for BSM scenarios. Indicates lifetime ratios are less sensitive compared to exclusive decay mode analyses.

Abstract: We calculate inclusive $B$-meson decay rates in the Mesogenesis framework, a
model explaining baryogenesis and the existence of dark matter, using the Heavy
Quark Expansion (HQE), up to the dimension-six two-quark Darwin term. By
systematically studying the power-suppressed contributions, we identify regions
of parameter space where subleading terms exceed the leading contribution,
i.e., the free $b$-quark decay, highlighting the limits of the HQE in this BSM
scenario. This behavior is reminiscent of the Standard Model only under
artificially heavy charm masses, and can be used to study the HQE close to its
breakdown. We further update the lower bounds on the exclusive decay mode $B^+
\to p^+ \psi$ by incorporating the fully HQE-corrected inclusive width in the
ratio $\Gamma_{\mathrm{excl}}/\Gamma_{\mathrm{incl}}$. Extending the analysis
from total decay rates to the lifetime ratio $\tau(B_s)/\tau(B_d)$, we find no
additional constraints on the couplings beyond existing collider bounds,
consistent with analogous results for $\tau(B^+)/\tau(B_d)$. We further compare
the sensitivity of both lifetime ratios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM) phenomenology and cosmic inflation within a
unified framework based on a dark $U(1)_D$ gauge extension of the Standard
Model (SM). The associated dark gauge boson, namely the dark photon, serves as
a viable DM candidate, which we call dark photon dark matter (DPDM), whilst the
dark Higgs field drives inflation. We explore a low-reheating scenario where DM
production occurs during reheating, resulting in significant entropy dilution
of the DPDM abundance. Both weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and
feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) DM scenarios are explored, depending
on the dark gauge coupling strength. For FIMP-type DM, the entropy dilution
allows for stronger couplings whilst maintaining the correct relic abundance,
potentially bringing these candidates within the reach of current and
near-future detection experiments. Similarly, WIMP-type DM can be realised with
weaker couplings. We perform a comprehensive parameter scan incorporating
constraints from collider data, DM direct and indirect detection experiments,
and cosmological observations. Taking quantum corrections and running of the
couplings into account, we demonstrate that dark Higgs inflation yields
predictions for the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$
that are consistent with the Planck, BICEP/Keck, and ACT data. The nonminimal
coupling of the dark Higgs inflaton field to gravity is shown to be much
smaller than in the case of the SM Higgs inflation scenario, avoiding unitarity
concerns. We show that reheating temperatures as low as 1 GeV and 1 MeV can be
achieved through the decay and scattering processes of the inflaton,
respectively, with the latter allowing for larger Higgs mixing angles and
enhanced detection prospects. Our results establish that this minimal extension
successfully unifies DM physics with inflationary cosmology.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent CMS analyses report an excess in the diphoton-plus-$b \bar{b}$
channel, indicative of a heavy resonance around 650 GeV decaying into a
Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson and a lighter scalar near 95 GeV. The case
for a 95 GeV state is further supported by diphoton excesses observed by both
CMS and ATLAS, as well as a $b\bar{b}$ excess previously observed at the Large
Electron-Position collider. This study present a unified interpretation of
these anomalies within the framework of the General Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model that naturally accommodates a light
singlet-dominated $CP$-even scalar boson near 95 GeV and an heavier
doublet-like scalar boson near 650 GeV. Through a comprehensive scan of the
parameter space, we demonstrate that the model can explain these excesses at
$2\sigma$ level while satisfying constraints from the dark matter relic
density, direct detection experiments, the properties of the 125 GeV Higgs
boson, $B$-physics observables, and searches for electroweakinos at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). The interpretation features a Bino-dominated lightest
neutralino as the dark matter candidate, whose relic abundance is achieved
primarily via $A_s$ funnel annihilation or coannihilation with $\tilde{S}$-like
$\tilde{\chi}^0_2$s into $h_sA_H$ final states. Our findings provide clear
predictions for testing this scenario at the high-luminosity LHC and future
colliders.

*Akash Das,Satya Ranjan Nayak,B. K. Singh*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study compares conventional deep neural networks (NN) with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for predicting charged hadron multiplicity in heavy-ion collisions. Using HYDJET++ simulated data, the PINN showed better generalization, particularly in high-multiplicity regions, despite requiring longer training times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how incorporating physics-based constraints improves prediction accuracy and generalization in neural networks for heavy-ion collision analysis.

Method: Trained NN and PINN models on 1 million Zr+Zr collision events from HYDJET++. PINN learns the hard-scattering fraction (x) from data. Tested on Ru+Ru and Au+Au collisions.

Result: PINN outperformed NN in predicting unseen data (e.g., Au+Au) and excelled in high Nch regions with sparse data. NN required less training time but lacked generalization in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Physics-informed models like PINN offer superior generalization for sparse or unseen data in particle physics, justifying the additional training time for critical predictions in high-multiplicity scenarios.

Abstract: In this study, we employ a conventional deep neural network (NN) framework
integrated with physics-based constraints to predict charged hadron
multiplicity ($N_{\text{ch}}$) in heavy-ion collisions. The goal is to assess
the performance of a purely data-driven deep neural network in comparison to a
physics-informed neural network (PINN). To accomplish this, we have taken data
generated from the HYDJET++ model for testing and training purposes. We train
our neural network frameworks using the data of one million individual
$^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}+^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}$ collision events. Our PINN model
successfully extracts the hard-scattering fraction ($x$) by learning its
underlying relation from the event data. For further testing and comparison
with the conventional NN, we take data of
$^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}+^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}$ (isobar of Zr) and
$^{197}_{79}\text{Au}+^{197}_{79}\text{Au}$ collisions using the same
simulation model. We found that the NN model needs more time to train with
physics. However, once trained, the PINN model is capable of accurately
predicting data that it has not encountered during training, such as Au+Au
collision results. Especially in a region of sparse data corresponding to high
$N_{\text{ch}}$ in our study, PINN has a clear advantage over a simple NN.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how resonant particle production during inflation could enhance dark matter annihilation signals, leading to detectable gamma-ray signatures.

Calculate enhanced annihilation rates for thermal WIMP dark matter. 4. Use 15 years of Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data from the Virgo cluster to derive constraints on annihilation cross sections.

Result: Derived upper limits on ⟨σv⟩ for thermal WIMPs, providing observational bounds that can test inflationary models predicting resonant particle production.

Conclusion: Observational data from Fermi-LAT limits the impact of resonant particle production on dark matter annihilation, offering a bridge between early universe physics and contemporary astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We explore the observational consequences of resonant particle production
during inflation, focusing on its impact on dark matter annihilation signals
today. A transient burst of particle production generates localised features in
the primordial power spectrum, enhancing the formation of compact small-scale
dark matter structures known as prompt cusps. If dark matter consists of
thermal WIMPs, the resulting small-scale structures substantially boost
annihilation rates, leaving potentially detectable imprints in gamma-ray
observations. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data targeting the Virgo cluster, we
derive upper limits on the thermally averaged annihilation cross section
$\langle \sigma v \rangle$, connecting inflationary particle production in the
early universe with present-day observations constraining dark matter
annihilation.

### [46] [Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering Cross Sections at Medium Energies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05413)
*Vishvas Pandey*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The chapter explains neutrino-nucleus interactions in the medium-energy range, key interaction mechanisms, nuclear effects, theoretical models, and their importance for neutrino oscillation experiments, serving as an introduction for early-career researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation measurements caused by neutrino-nucleus interactions and provide foundational knowledge for newcomers in the field.

Method: The chapter uses the electroweak formalism to outline interaction mechanisms (quasielastic scattering, resonance production, deep inelastic scattering) and discusses nuclear effects (Fermi motion, nucleon correlations, meson currents, final-state interactions). It also reviews theoretical models and relevant experiments.

Result: Strengthens understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions, their nuclear effects, and their role in oscillation experiments, aiding in reducing uncertainties and guiding future research.

Conclusion: A comprehensive overview is provided for non-experts, emphasizing the need for continued study in this area to improve experimental precision and bridge particle and nuclear physics concepts.

Abstract: The weak interactions of neutrinos with other Standard Model particles are
well described within the Standard Model of particle physics. However, modern
accelerator-based neutrino experiments employ nuclei as targets, where
neutrinos interact with bound nucleons, turning a seemingly simple electroweak
process into a complex many-body problem in nuclear physics. At the time of
writing this Encyclopedia of Particle Physics chapter, neutrino-nucleus
interactions remain one of the leading sources of systematic uncertainty in
accelerator-based neutrino oscillation measurements.
  This chapter provides a pedagogical overview of neutrino interactions with
nuclei in the medium-energy regime, spanning a few hundred MeV to several GeV.
It introduces the fundamental electroweak formalism, outlines the dominant
interaction mechanisms - including quasielastic scattering, resonance
production, and deep inelastic scattering - and discusses how nuclear effects
such as Fermi motion, nucleon-nucleon correlations, meson-exchange currents,
and final-state interactions modify observable cross sections. The chapter also
presents a brief survey of the foundational and most widely used theoretical
models for neutrino-nucleus cross sections, together with an overview of
current and upcoming accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments that
are shaping the field.
  Rather than targeting experts, this chapter serves as a primer for advanced
undergraduates, graduate students, and early-career researchers entering the
field. It provides a concise foundation for understanding neutrino-nucleus
scattering, its relevance to oscillation experiments, and its broader
connections to both particle and nuclear physics.

### [47] [D-Dimensional Modular Assembly of Higher-Derivative Four-Point Contact Amplitudes Involving Fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05441)
*John Joseph M. Carrasco,Sai Sasank Chava,Alex Edison,Aslan Seifi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for building D-dimensional four-point higher-derivative contact amplitudes using a modular, block-based approach that ensures gauge invariance, symmetry, and compatibility with the double-copy framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a systematic and robust framework for constructing higher-derivative amplitudes that handles gauge invariance, D-dimensional evanescent operators, and scalability without combinatorial explosion, while aligning with the double-copy program for broader theory applications.

Method: A LEGO-like modular approach combining gauge-invariant kinematic blocks, color factors, and scalar Mandelstam polynomials. Symmetries (Bose/Fermi) are enforced algebraically to filter compatible combinations. Uses permutation-invariant scalar polynomials to scale to any mass dimension efficiently.

Result: Demonstrates a framework capable of generating operator towers for gauge theories and double-copy related theories (like gravity) with controlled scaling in mass dimensions and proper inclusion of evanescent operators.

Conclusion: The method provides a powerful tool for higher-derivative amplitude construction, ensuring consistency in loop-level calculations and extending applicability across various theories through the double-copy mechanism.

Abstract: We present a novel robust framework for systematically constructing
D-dimensional four-point higher-derivative contact amplitudes. Our modular
block ("LEGO"-like) approach builds amplitudes directly from manifestly
gauge-invariant kinematic blocks, color-weight factors, and scalar Mandelstam
polynomials. Symmetries (Bose/Fermi) are imposed algebraically, acting as
filters on combinations of compatible pieces. This framework operates entirely
in D dimensions, naturally incorporating evanescent operators crucial for
loop-level consistency. Scaling to arbitrary mass dimension is achieved in a
highly controlled manner using permutation-invariant scalar polynomials,
avoiding combinatorial explosion. A key feature is its manifest compatibility
with the double-copy program, allowing the systematic generation of operator
towers not only for gauge theories but also for gravity and other theories
within the double-copy web.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Superallowed ($0^+\rightarrow0^+$) beta decays currently provide the most
precise extraction of quark mixing in the Standard Model. Their interpretation
as a measurement of $|V_{ud}|$ relies on a reliable first-principles
computation of QED radiative corrections expressed as a series in $Z\alpha$ and
$\alpha$. In this work, we provide the first model-independent result for
two-loop, $O(Z\alpha^2)$, long-distance radiative corrections where the nuclei
are treated as heavy point-like particles.
  We use renormalization group analysis to obtain new results at $O(Z\alpha^3)$
for the coefficient of double-logarithms in the ratio of the maximal beta
energy to the inverse nuclear size, $\Em/R^{-1}$. We use the
Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem to obtain new results at $O(Z^2\alpha^3)$ for
the coefficient of logarithms in the ratio of maximal beta energy to the
electron mass, $\log(2\Em/\me)$. We identify a structure-dependent, and
therefore short-distance, contribution to the traditional $Z\alpha^2$
correction that should be revisited.. We provide the first comprehensive update
to the long-distance corrections in almost forty years and comment on the
impact of our findings for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. We find that shifts in
the long-distance corrections are $2.5\times$ larger than past estimates of
their uncertainty, $1.5\times$ larger than the statistical uncertainty from the
combined fit of superallowed decays, and about $1/2$ the size of estimated
systematic error, which stems dominantly from nuclear structure effects.

### [49] [Radiative corrections to superallowed beta decays at $\mathcal O(α^2 Z)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05481)
*Òscar L. Crosas,Emanuele Mereghetti*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper calculates $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2 Z)$ radiative corrections for superallowed $\beta$ decays using a heavy-particle effective field theory. They compute two-loop virtual and one-loop real-virtual amplitudes via Feynman integral reduction, solving master integrals analytically. The method is applicable to other observables. Combining ultrasoft photon corrections with potential photon contributions, they include logarithmic resummation. The corrections contribute between 0.7 and 3.6 permille to decay rates, reducing renormalization scale dependence and improving $V_{ud}$ extraction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately determine the CKM matrix element $V_{ud}$ with permille precision, precise calculations of radiative corrections in superallowed $\beta$ decays are essential. Previous works neglected ultrasoft photon contributions, which are significant for heavy nuclei and must be included to reduce theoretical uncertainties.

Method: The authors use a heavy-particle effective field theory to systematically handle low-energy ultrasoft photon interactions with nuclei. Two-loop virtual and one-loop real-virtual amplitudes are calculated by reducing Feynman integrals to master integrals, solved analytically. The ultrasoft corrections are combined with potential photon exchange contributions, including resummation of large logarithms proportional to electron energy times nuclear radius.

Result: The $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2 Z)$ ultrasoft loop corrections contribute relative decay rate corrections between 0.7 and 3.6 permille for $^{10}$C and $^{54}$Co decays, respectively. These reduce renormalization scale dependence to negligible levels, making missing ultrasoft corrections a minor source of theoretical error in $V_{ud}$ determinations.

Conclusion: The derived ultrasoft corrections are necessary for achieving permille-level accuracy in $V_{ud}$ extraction from superallowed $\beta$ decays. The methods developed here provide a framework applicable to other precision calculations involving ultrasoft photons and heavy nuclei.

Abstract: We compute $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ radiative corrections to superallowed
$\beta$ decays with a heavy-particle effective field theory that systematically
describes the interactions of low-energy ultrasoft photons with nuclei. We
calculate two-loop virtual and one-loop real-virtual amplitudes by reducing the
Feynman integrals to a set of master integrals, which we solve analytically
using a variety of techniques. These techniques can be applied to other
phenomenologically interesting observables. The ultrasoft corrections can then
be combined with contributions arising from the exchange of potential photons
to obtain the complete $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ correction to the decay rate,
with resummation of large logarithms of the electron energy times the nuclear
radius. We find that $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ ultrasoft loops induce a relative
correction to the decay rate that ranges from $0.7 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay
of $^{10}$C to $3.6 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{54}$Co, and will thus
impact the extraction of $V_{ud}$ at the permille level. We show that the
inclusion of these corrections reduces the residual renormalization scale
dependence of the decay rate to a negligible level, making missing ultrasoft
perturbative corrections a subdominant source of theoretical error.
