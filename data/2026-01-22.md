### [1] [The Simplest B Decay, Precisely](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14361)
*Claudia Cornella,Max Ferré,Matthias König,Matthias Neubert*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a QCD×QED factorization theorem for the B⁻→μ⁻ν̄ₘ(γ) decay, using effective field theories to handle multi-scale electromagnetic corrections. It provides a precise prediction for the photon-vetoed rate, enabling accurate determinations of |V_ub| and new physics tests. Key contributions include NLP SCET operator basis, a SCET-friendly reduction scheme, endpoint divergent refactorization, resummation of rapidity logs, and chiral meson decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address precision measurements of the B⁻→μ⁻ν̄ₘ(γ) decay, requiring precise theoretical predictions for |V_ub| extraction and sensitivity to new physics. Previous studies lacked complete NLP QED effects and multi-scale treatment.

Method: 1. Applied successive EFTs (SCET, HQET, HChPT) to separate scales. 2. Constructed NLP SCET operator basis. 3. Introduced a 'SCET-friendly' Dirac structure reduction scheme. 4. Resummed rapidity logs via refactorization of endpoint divergences. 5. Performed non-perturbative matching below QCD confinement scale. 6. Analyzed decay rate components via direct/indirect contributions and anomaly effects.

Result: First complete NLP QED analysis in B-meson decays with percent-level precision predictions. Systematically accounted for all NLP QED effects, establishing theoretical framework for future high-precision experiments. Highlighted chiral anomaly contributions and demonstrated photon radiation specturm fidelity.

Conclusion: Successful derivation of multi-scale factorization framework. NLP QED contributions essential for <1% precision in |V_ub| determinations. Results lay foundation for experimental tests of Standard Model validity against new physics scenarios using B⁻→μ⁻ν̄ₘ channel.

Abstract: We derive the QCD$\times$QED factorization theorem governing the leptonic decay $B^-\toμ^-\barν_μ(γ)$ at all orders in $α_s$ and $α$. Electromagnetic corrections to this decay probe multiple scales, which we disentangle through a sequence of effective field theories (EFTs). The resulting state-of-the-art prediction for the photon-vetoed rate includes the complete structure-dependent component and is accurate at the percent level, establishing the theoretical framework required for future high-precision measurements of this channel, which will allow for a clean determination of $|V_{ub}|$ and powerful tests of new physics. Our work presents the first complete study of QED effects to an exclusive $B$-meson decay at next-to-leading power (NLP) in the heavy-quark expansion. Important milestones are (i) the construction of the complete NLP operator basis in soft-collinear effective theory (SCET); (ii) the proposal of a "SCET-friendly" reduction scheme for the Dirac structures of four-fermion operators in dimensional regularization, which avoids power-enhanced evanescent operators; (iii) the consistent refactorization of endpoint-divergent convolution integrals and the first complete resummation of "rapidity logarithms" arising at the boundary between the contributions involving soft and hard-collinear quarks; (iv) the systematic discussion of the EFT below the scale of QCD confinement and the non-perturbative matching of SCET onto this low-energy theory; (v) the decoupling of pseudoscalar mesons in the context of heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory, so that they can be integrated out for processes in which they do not appear as external particles. We perform a phenomenological analysis of direct and indirect contributions to the decay rate and radiation-energy spectrum, highlighting the importance of the chiral anomaly.

### [2] [Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes produced by Dark Meta Stable Vacuum Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14366)
*Haipeng An,Tingyu Li,Chen Yang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the implications of a dark-sector phase transition in a metastable vacuum landscape, focusing on gravitational wave signals and primordial black hole suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dark sector's role in cosmology, addressing dark matter, dark energy, and the vacuum stability via the dark landscape concept.

Method: Investigates the phase transition's phenomenology by analyzing gravitational-wave backgrounds and primordial black hole formation, using nucleation rate calculations and cosmological constraints.

Result: A gravitational wave spectrum peaking at k_peak = 3.1 H_PT with amplitude Ω_GW^peak ≈ 1.5Ω_γ(Δρ/ρ_tot)²; primordial black hole formation is suppressed by ΔN_eff constraints.

Conclusion: The dark-sector phase transition offers a testable scenario for cosmological observations, particularly through gravitational wave detectors, while aligning with CMB constraints on effective neutrino species.

Abstract: Inspired by string theory and cosmological constant problem, it is plausible that the Universe's vacuum structure is characterized by a landscape of metastable vacua. The existence of dark matter and dark energy further suggests that the dark sector may inhabit its own "dark landscape". If the dark vacuum is metastable, bubbles of lower-energy phases can nucleate at an approximately constant rate. Because the Hubble expansion rate is monotonically non-increasing with cosmic time, such nucleation can eventually lead to percolation and completion of a dark-sector phase transition. In this work, we investigate the phenomenological consequences of this transition, focusing on the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background and the potential formation of primordial black holes. We find that the gravitational wave spectrum peaks at $k_{\mathrm{peak}}=3.1 H_{\mathrm{PT}}$, with an amplitude $Ω_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\mathrm{peak}}\simeq1.5 Ω_γ(Δρ/ρ_{\mathrm{tot}})^2$. Furthermore, the formation of primordial black holes is suppressed due to $ΔN_{\mathrm{eff}}$ constraint.

### [3] [Neutrino Masses with Enhanced $B-L$ Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14376)
*Xiyuan Gao,Amir N. Khan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an 'enhanced $B-L$ symmetry' where two right-handed neutrinos have charges enhanced by arbitrary factors, allowing neutrino masses from sub-eV-scale symmetry breaking linked to a gravity-induced condensate. This setup may constrain the gauge coupling via neutrino decay and produce detectable signals through $A'$ interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the seesaw mechanism's shortcomings and explore $B-L$ symmetry's role in neutrino masses without requiring extremely heavy scales. The motivation is to explain neutrino masses at lower energy scales and connect it to possible new physics detectable in experiments.

Method: Relaxing charge quantization in $U(1)_{B-L}$ allows enhancing B-L charges of two right-handed neutrinos while keeping other fermions' charges canonical. The symmetry is gauged and kept unbroken to maintain chiral, massless neutrinos; masses arise from sub-eV-scale breaking via neutrino condensate. Implications for $A'$ interactions and constraints are analyzed.

Result: The enhanced $B-L$ model naturally accommodates sub-eV-scale seesaw, leads to observable neutrino decays to $A'$ if $A'$ is lighter than neutrinos, and predicts $A'$ mediated scatterings testable in neutrino observatories and dark matter detectors. This offers stronger constraints on gauge couplings than traditional fifth-force tests.

Conclusion: The enhanced $B-L$ symmetry provides a viable framework for light neutrino masses consistent with cosmology and particle physics observations. It opens avenues for experimental detection of the $A'$ boson and testing new physics at low energies.

Abstract: Assuming all three known neutrinos are Dirac fermions, $U(1)_{B-L}$ can be an exact symmetry. We show that, if the condition of charge quantization is relaxed, the anomaly-free $B-L$ charges of two out of three right-handed neutrinos can be enhanced by arbitrarily large factors, while all other fermions retain their canonical charges. We call this setup as `enhanced $B-L$ symmetry' and promote it to be local. As long as this enhanced $B-L$ gauge symmetry remains unbroken, neutrinos stay chiral and massless at low energies. Nonzero neutrino masses then require sub-eV-scale symmetry breaking order parameters, which we associate with gravity-induced neutrino condensate. If the enhancement is large and the $B-L$ gauge boson $A'$ is lighter than the heaviest neutrino, then the neutrino decay into $A'$ directly constrains the gauge coupling, which can be significantly stronger than the baryon-based fifth-force tests. Through kinetic mixing with the photon, $A'$ can also mediate neutrino-electron and coherent neutrino-nucleus scatterings, leading to possible signatures in neutrino observatories and dark matter detectors.

### [4] [Emergent Large Lepton Mixing from Neutrino Refraction in Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14386)
*Susobhan Chattopadhyay,Yuber F. Perez-Gonzalez,Manibrata Sen*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: Proposes a mechanism where the difference between quark and lepton flavor mixing arises from neutrinos interacting with ultralight dark matter, generating large lepton mixings dynamically without new symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the quark-lepton flavor mixing disparity and quark-lepton complementarity without introducing new flavor symmetries.

Method: Postulates CKM-like fundamental mixing in both sectors with tiny vacuum neutrino masses. Derives PMNS matrix via coherent scattering of neutrinos off ultralight dark matter, modifying the in-medium Hamiltonian to rotate CKM angles into large effective mixings.

Result: Naturally realizes quark-lepton complementarity, links neutrino mass, flavor mixing, and dark matter, predicts environment-dependent oscillation effects for experimental testing.

Conclusion: Offers a unified framework connecting fundamental particles and dark matter, with testable predictions for neutrino physics experiments.

Abstract: We propose a novel origin for the disparity between quark and lepton flavor mixing based on the refractive nature of neutrino masses. We postulate that the fundamental mixing in both the quark and lepton sectors is CKM-like, together with tiny vacuum neutrino masses, while the observed PMNS mixing matrix emerges dynamically from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos on an ultralight dark matter background. The resulting in-medium Hamiltonian rotates CKM mixing angles into large effective lepton mixings, naturally realizing quark--lepton complementarity without invoking new flavor symmetries. This framework links neutrino mass generation, flavor mixing, and dark matter, and predicts environment-dependent neutrino oscillation effects testable in current and future experiments.

### [5] [Constraints on Loryons in a Two Higgs Doublet Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14389)
*Can Kilic,Sanjay Mathai,Taewook Youn*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores Loryons—beyond Standard Model particles whose masses are partly from electroweak symmetry breaking—in a two Higgs doublet model. It examines constraints from unitarity, Higgs decay observables, and vacuum stability using specific scalar Loryon representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate Loryons' viability in a two Higgs doublet model by analyzing theoretical constraints to ensure they align with electroweak symmetry breaking mechanisms and observational data.

Method: Uses scalar Loryons in [1,1], [1,3]/[3,1], and [2,2] representations under custodial SU(2)_L×SU(2)_R symmetry as benchmarks. Analyzes unitarity, Higgs decay measurements, and absence of Loryon vevs to constrain parameters.

Result: Identifies allowed parameter regions for Loryons that satisfy unitarity, Higgs data consistency, and vacuum stability, providing insights into BSM physics within two Higgs doublet frameworks.

Conclusion: Loryons in specific representations can coexist with electroweak symmetry breaking in two Higgs doublet models if parameters meet derived constraints, offering a potential path for beyond Standard Model exploration.

Abstract: We consider Loryons, particles beyond the Standard Model that receive a significant fraction of their masses from electroweak symmetry breaking, in the context of a two Higgs doublet model. Using scalar Loryons in the the $[1,1]$, $[1,3]$ (as well as the equivalent $[3,1]$) and the $[2,2]$ representations of the custodial $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ global symmetry as benchmarks, we study the constraints on the Loryon parameter space, focusing on unitarity, Higgs decay observables, and the absence of Loryon vacuum expectation values.

### [6] [Gravitational Waves in an A4 Neutrino Mass Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14394)
*Mu-Chun Chen,Harold J. Matias,Cameron Moffett-Smith*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new A4×Z4 symmetric model addressing domain wall issues and predicting detectable gravitational waves linked to pulsar timing array observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the domain wall problem caused by spontaneous A4 symmetry breaking while naturally explaining neutrino mixing angles and generating a detectable gravitational wave signal.

Method: The model incorporates A4 and Z4 symmetries with flavon cross-couplings. Domain walls annihilate via vacuum degeneracy lifting through bias terms from these interactions, avoiding explicit symmetry breaking. Neutrino mixing is predicted via flavon couplings.

Result: Achieves cosmologically viable domain wall annihilation, realistic neutrino mixing, and predicts gravitational wave signals overlapping with pulsar timing array observations.

Conclusion: The cross-coupled A4×Z4 model successfully addresses domain walls naturally, aligns with neutrino data, and offers testable gravitational wave predictions intersecting current astrophysical observations.

Abstract: The A4 flavor symmetry has provided tremendous insight into the flavor structure of the lepton sector of the Standard Model, predicting a very good approximation to neutrino mixing angles, Tri-Bimaximal Mixing. A4 is spontaneously broken by a scalar called the flavon, and when this happens a number of degenerate vacua can form, resulting in so-called domain walls. These objects are not observed and hence need to be annihilated. This is usually done by explicitly breaking A4 by adding a bias term to the scalar potential. In this paper, we construct a new model invariant under A4 and Z4, which creates cosmologically viable domain walls, lifts the degeneracy of the vacuum giving a natural mechanism for domain walls to annihilate, as well as predicts realistic neutrino mixing angles; all utilizing cross couplings between flavons. The annihilation of the domain walls, with proper choice of wall tension and the consequent bias term, leads to a gravitational wave signal that is potentially detectable in near future gravitational wave experiments, and interestingly intersects with the observed Pulsar Timing Array signal.

### [7] [Weak boson probes of Higgs unitarity restoration at 10 TeV parton colliders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14404)
*Christoph Englert,Wrishik Naskar,Andrew D. Pilkington,Michael Spannowsky*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how deviations in Higgs couplings from Standard Model predictions, detectable at the high-luminosity LHC, could lead to a 'no-lose theorem' for future colliders. It compares the capabilities of a 100 TeV hadron collider and a 10 TeV muon collider in detecting unitarity violation caused by such deviations, showing both can probe mass scales up to ~6 TeV. It also highlights the role of an FCC-ee precision program in validating these findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a phenomenological framework ensuring discovery potential for new physics via Higgs coupling deviations without relying on specific models. The motivation arises from the need to address unitarity violation constraints at high energy scales and validate collider capabilities beyond the LHC.

Method: The study correlates observed Higgs coupling deviations in the gauge sector with unitarity constraints at high energies. Sensitivity estimates are derived for both 100 TeV hadron and 10 TeV muon colliders by analyzing how subpercent coupling modifications impact unitarity, requiring corrections at specific mass scales.

Result: Both collider types can probe mass scales up to ~6 TeV where unitarity violations from Higgs coupling deviations are resolved. The analysis shows complementary strengths between lepton and hadron colliders, with muon colliders offering cleaner environments and hadron colliders providing higher energy reach.

Conclusion: Future colliders are guaranteed to discover new physics (or tightly constrain models) if Higgs coupling deviations at the subpercent level are detected. A staged experimental program involving FCC-ee precision measurements and high-energy colliders is recommended to cross-verify results.

Abstract: Higgs coupling deviations, at levels accessible to the high-luminosity LHC, can imply a phenomenological no-lose theorem for the next generation of collider facilities. Correlating Higgs coupling deviations from the SM expectation in the gauge boson sector with high-scale unitarity requirements, we estimate and compare the sensitivity that can be expected at a future hadron collider (operating at 100 TeV centre-of-mass energy) and a 10 TeV muon collider. Both muon and hadron colliders offer discovery potential for mass scales up to ${\cal{O}}(6~\text{TeV})$ where unitarity violation induced by (sub)percent Higgs coupling modifications is mended. We comment on how an intermediate precision FCC-ee programme can corroborate such deviations.

### [8] [How large are curvature perturbations from slow first-order phase transitions? A gauge-invariant analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14412)
*Xiao Wang,Csaba Balázs,Ran Ding,Chi Tian*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates super-horizon curvature perturbations from slow, strongly supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions, showing they likely don't produce primordial black holes and provides observational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether super-horizon inhomogeneities from slow phase transitions can generate Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and to establish observational limits on such phase transitions.

Method: Used gauge-invariant multi-fluid formalism to compute curvature perturbations, resolving gauge ambiguities in conventional separate-universe simulations.

Result: Demonstrated PBH production via super-horizon inhomogeneities from these phase transitions is improbable; derived a fitting formula for curvature perturbations.

Conclusion: Such FOPTs constrained by PBH limits and gravitational wave observations provide bounds on phase transition parameters.

Abstract: When strongly supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) are sufficiently slow, super-horizon inhomogeneities can be generated. We compute these super-horizon curvature perturbations by employing a gauge-invariant, multi-fluid formalism. By resolving the gauge ambiguities inherent in conventional separate-universe simulations, we demonstrate that Primordial Black Holes are unlikely to be produced by these super-horizon inhomogeneities. We also derive a fitting formula for the resulting curvature perturbations and discuss potential observational constraints on FOPTs imposed by limits on primordial curvature perturbations and associated scalar-induced gravitational waves.

### [9] [Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14450)
*Igor A. Shovkovy,Ritesh Ghosh*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines neutrino emission mechanisms in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, focusing on direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes. It highlights the anisotropic and oscillatory emissivity effects on magnetar cooling and pulsar kicks, emphasizing magnetic fields' critical role in compact star evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how strong magnetic fields influence neutrino emission in compact stars' quark cores, impacting their thermal and dynamical evolution, particularly magnetar cooling and pulsar kicks.

Method: The study analyzes direct Urca and synchrotron processes in magnetized quark matter, incorporating Landau-level quantization for electrons and quarks. It evaluates emissivity anisotropy and oscillations with magnetic field strength, considering high baryon densities where quark quantization is negligible.

Result: Direct Urca emissivity shows field-dependent anisotropy and oscillations, while synchrotron emission, though subdominant, reveals magnetic field-weak interaction interplay. These effects could explain magnetar cooling patterns and anisotropic neutrino emission driving pulsar kicks.

Conclusion: Strong magnetic fields significantly alter neutrino production in quark cores, crucial for modeling compact star evolution. Future observations of magnetar temperatures and pulsar velocities may validate these theoretical predictions.

Abstract: We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $ν\barν$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.

### [10] [Symmetry Nonrestoration in the Pati-Salam Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14580)
*N. Okada,A. Stern*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that symmetry in the Pati-Salam model doesn't need to be restored at high temperatures, avoiding monopole production even with high reheating temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate monopole-based constraints on the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale by preventing thermal production of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles post-inflation.

Method: Analyzes finite-temperature corrections in the Pati-Salam model, demonstrating that quartic couplings prevent symmetry restoration above the Pati-Salam breaking scale.

Result: Symmetry remains broken to the Standard Model group at high temperatures, avoiding monopole production even with high reheating temperatures.

Conclusion: The Pati-Salam model's symmetry breaking scale constraints from monopoles are removed, supporting its viability at higher energy scales.

Abstract: We demonstrate that symmetry need not be restored in the Pati-Salam model, so that $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R\otimes SU(4)_c$ remains broken to the Standard Model group at temperatures above the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale. Including the leading finite-temperature corrections, suitable quartic couplings prevent a restoration transition, thereby avoiding the thermal production of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles after inflation, even if the reheating temperature is very high. This removes monopole-based constraints on the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale.

### [11] [Elastic lepton-proton two-photon exchange scattering: An exact HB$χ$PT analysis including hadronic effects at NNLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14636)
*Rakshanda Goswami,Pulak Talukdar,Bhoomika Das,Udit Raha,Fred Myhrer*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an exact analytical evaluation of two-photon exchange (TPE) corrections to the elastic electron-proton scattering cross section at low energies using heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately compute TPE effects relevant to the MUSE experiment, avoiding approximations like the soft-photon method to capture residual structure-dependent contributions.

Method: Analytical evaluation of TPE corrections at NNLO in the recoil expansion, including proton recoil and radiative effects, restricted to elastic channels. All loop integrals are calculated exactly without approximations.

Result: Residual proton structure effects of order α/M² remain after cancellations between TPE contributions. NNLO corrections are small, suggesting good chiral convergence. Earlier soft-photon approximations missed these effects.

Conclusion: Exact analytic treatment reveals non-negligible structure-dependent TPE effects at NNLO, emphasizing the need for precise calculations beyond soft-photon approximations in lepton-scattering experiments.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical evaluation of the two-photon exchange (TPE) correction to the elastic lepton-proton differential scattering cross section at low-energies within the framework of heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory. Our analysis focuses on the kinematic regime relevant to the ongoing MUSE experiment, and we therefore restrict the intermediate states to the dominant elastic channel. All loop integrals are evaluated analytically without approximations. Radiative and chiral recoil contributions of the proton are included, retaining kinematical and dynamical TPE corrections to the cross section through next-to-next-to-leading order [i.e., ${\mathcal O}(α/M^2)$] accuracy in the recoil expansion where $M$ is the proton mass. At this chiral order, pion-loop contributions demonstrate that structure-dependent TPE effects arise through the proton form factors. Our analytical results for the scattering cross section reveal non-vanishing residual proton structure effects of ${\mathcal O}(α/M^2)$, despite substantial cancellations between TPE box and crossed-box contributions. Such effects were entirely absent at this accuracy in our earlier analysis based on the soft-photon approximation. Although the next-to-leading-order contributions are numerically sizable, the next-to-next-to-leading-order TPE corrections are found to be small, thereby indicating that the chiral expansion exhibits reasonably good perturbative convergence.

### [12] [Long-Lived Oscillons as Closed Domain Walls in the $\mathbb Z_2$-Symmetric Two-Higgs-Doublet Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14676)
*Zhaoyu Meng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents oscillatory bubble-like domain walls in the 2HDM with Z2 symmetry, explaining their long lifetimes through a two-vacuum potential and suppressed radiation in specific parameter spaces. Stability under perturbations is confirmed numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore long-lived domain wall structures in the 2HDM under Z2 symmetry, understanding their emergence during domain wall decay and the factors influencing their stability and lifetime.

Method: 1. Analyze two-complex-field system to establish mathematical requirements. 2. Extend to 2HDM model. 3. Use Floquet analysis for numerical stability verification. 4. Parameter space exploration focusing on radiation suppression effects.

Result: 1. Identified oscillatory bubble-like domain walls with maximum lifetime approaching infinity under specific parameters. 2. Found that two-vacuum potential regions (inner oscillating vs outer constant) sustain the structures. 3. Demonstrated stability against perturbations via Floquet analysis.

Conclusion: These long-lived domain wall configurations provide new insights into 2HDM dynamics, offering potential cosmological applications where stable, long-lasting structures are relevant. The parameter-dependent radiation suppression mechanism explains their extreme longevity.

Abstract: We identify an oscillatory solution that exists as a long-lived, bubble-like closed domain wall in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry constraint, and these structures emerge naturally during the late stages of domain wall decay. \\ \\ The longevity of these structures is attributed to a potential landscape characterized by two distinct vacuum regions, the oscillating region lies in one vacuum, while the constant outer region lies in the other. The lifetime of the structure depends on the parameter in the Lagrangian, we identify a specific parameter space where radiation is suppressed, the solution exhibits a maximum lifetime that goes up to infinity. \\ \\ The simpler two-complex-field system is first used to introduce the mathematical requirements of the structure before extending it to the more physical but complex 2HDM. Further Numerical verification via Floquet analysis shows these structures are stable under perturbation.

### [13] [Systematic study of the strong decays of the $P_c$ states and their possible isospin cousins via the QCD sum rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14723)
*Xiu-Wu Wang,Xin Li,Zhi-Gang Wang*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper studies the strong decays of $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$ and their isospin partners using QCD sum rules, finding agreement with experimental data and providing predictions for further experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the strong decays of the newly discovered $P_c$ states and their isospin cousins, testing the molecular state assignment hypothesis.

Method: Calculated strong decay constants and partial decay widths using QCD sum rules under the assumption that $P_c$ states are meson-baryon molecular states.

Result: Computed decay widths match experimental observations for $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$. Predictions for isospin partner decays are provided to guide experimental searches.

Conclusion: The results support the molecular state interpretation of $P_c$ states. Experimental verification of predicted isospin cousins could further confirm this assignment.

Abstract: In the present work, the strong decays of the discovered $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$, $P_c(4457)$ and their possible isospin cousins are systematically studied via the assignment that they are the meson-baryon molecular states. In detail, the strong decay constants, partial decay widths of their decay channels are calculated under the framework of QCD sum rules. The decay withes of the discovered $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ are in good agreement with the experiments. The predictions of the decays of these three related possible isospin cousins are presented which would shed light for their findings in experiment, in return, this may testify the assignments of the discovered $P_c$ states.

### [14] [Phenomenology of a doble dilaton soft-wall model: Alpha strong from Ricci flow and pion Form Factors at intermediate-energy region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14829)
*Héctor Cancio,Pere Masjuan*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a holographic QCD model with a double dilaton and large-N corrections to study the running of α_s across all energy scales, achieving a smooth transition between non-perturbative and pQCD regimes using two parameters. It predicts Regge trajectories and meson decay constants matching experiments, and applies the model to pion form factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the non-perturbative and perturbative regimes of QCD by providing a unified description of α_s运行 dynamics using holography, avoiding complexities of lattice QCD while incorporating key symmetries and quantum corrections.

Method: A holographic QCD model with double dilatons and large-N_c corrections. Uses Ricci Flow for metric tensor renormalization and symmetry breaking to establish an IR fixed point and match with pQCD above 2 GeV. Two fit parameters and one matching point are employed.

Result: The model successfully reproduces linear Regge trajectories and experimental meson decay constants. Applications to pion form factors demonstrate the validity of the running α_s across energy scales.

Conclusion: The holographic approach with dilatonic corrections offers a viable framework for unifying QCD dynamics across all energy scales, providing a simple yet effective tool for hadron physics studies.

Abstract: Through a holographic model of QCD, we present a phenomenological approach to study the running of the strong coupling constant α_s in both non-perturbative and perturbative regimes. The renormalization of the metric tensor, driven by the Ricci Flow, and the breaking of conformal and chiral symmetries -thanks to introducing a double dilaton model and large-N_c corrections- allow us to relate the existence of an infrared fixed point in the coupling constant with a smooth matching to pQCD well above 2 GeV. This is done through a model with two fit parameters and one matching point. The proposed dilaton model yields linear Regge trajectories and decay constants for scalar, vector, and tensor meson families similar to their experimental counterparts. We finally study neutral and charged pion form factors to show an application of the running coupling constant obtained.

*João Paulo Pinheiro*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This thesis explores neutrino physics through three pillars: consolidating three-flavor oscillation parameters, constraining Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with experimental data, and refining solar neutrino flux determinations to address Standard Model extensions and solar models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate beyond Standard Model physics using neutrino oscillations, validate the three-flavor paradigm, and improve precision in solar neutrino measurements to guide future experimental efforts.

Method: Global analysis of neutrino oscillation data from solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator experiments; combined analysis of Borexino and COHERENT experiments to constrain NSI parameters; precision solar flux determinations using pp-chain and CNO-cycle data.

Result: Updated three-flavor mixing parameters with quantified ambiguities; exclusion of NSI parameter regions including LMA-D solutions; preference for high-metallicity solar models and incompatibility between 3+1 mixing parameters and solar observations.

Conclusion: Findings advance neutrino physics by narrowing parameter spaces for BSM theories, highlighting unresolved issues in mass ordering and CP violation, and identifying requirements for future experiments targeting dark sector interactions and improved solar models.

Abstract: Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes.
  The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses.
  The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($θ_{12}$, $θ_{13}$, $θ_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($Δm^2_{21}$, $Δm^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $θ_{23}$ octant.
  The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$ν$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions.

### [16] [Central exclusive production of $η$ and $η'$ mesons in diffractive proton-proton collisions at the LHC and the nature of the pomeron](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14870)
*Piotr Lebiedowicz,Otto Nachtmann,Antoni Szczurek*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes central exclusive production (CEP) of η and η' mesons in proton-proton collisions at high energies, comparing scalar-pomeron and tensor-pomeron models. It concludes that only the tensor-pomeron model allows CEP via double-pomeron exchange, presenting cross-sections and distributions at 29.1 GeV and 13 TeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the viability of scalar-pomeron vs. tensor-pomeron models in explaining η and η' meson production through double-pomeron exchange in high-energy proton collisions.

Method: The study uses theoretical calculations to compare fusion reactions in scalar and tensor-pomeron models (IP-IP → η, η'). Cross sections and distributions are computed for center-of-mass energies of 29.1 GeV (WA102 experiment) and 13 TeV (LHC).

Result: Scalar pomeron model forbids CEP of η/η' via double-pomeron exchange, while tensor-pomeron allows it. Results show differing cross-sections and distributions between the two energies, supporting the tensor-pomeron model's validity.

Conclusion: The tensor-pomeron model is necessary for explaining CEP of η/η' mesons at high energies. The findings validate the model against experimental conditions at WA102 and LHC scales.

Abstract: Central exclusive production (CEP) of $η$ and $η'$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at high-energies is discussed. At the LHC the main mechanism for the production of these mesons should be double-pomeron ($\rm I\!P$-$\rm I\!P$) exchange, that is, the fusion reactions ${\rm I\!P I\!P} \to η, η'$. We show that for a scalar pomeron these fusion reactions are not possible. In contrast, in the tensor-pomeron model CEP of $η$ and $η'$ mesons via double-pomeron exchange is allowed. We discuss these reactions for the c.m. energy $\sqrt{s} = 29.1$ GeV realised at the WA102 experiment and for $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV corresponding to the LHC experiments. Cross sections and distributions are presented and discussed.

### [17] [Semileptonic decays $D_{(s)} \to η^{(\prime)} \ell^+ ν_\ell$ from QCD Light-Cone Sum Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14915)
*Xiao-En Huang,Shan Cheng,De-Liang Yao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses QCD light-cone sum rules with high-twist contributions and NLO QCD corrections to reanalyze D and D_s meson transitions to η/η' mesons. It confirms chiral enhancement from twist-3 effects, validates OPE convergence, and uses precise BESIII data to determine optimal η-η' mixing parameters. Results show preference for small decay constants and large mixing angles in the quark flavor basis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reanalyze transition form factors with updated theoretical methods and precision BESIII data, validate the role of chiral enhancement and OPE convergence, and refine η-η' mixing parameters critical for understanding meson structure and testing QCD predictions.

Method: QCD light-cone sum rules incorporating high-twist terms (including twist-3 chiral enhancement contributions) and next-to-leading-order QCD corrections. Analysis compares predictions with experimental measurements of D, D_s → η(′) ℓν_ℓ decay rates.

Result: Confirm chiral enhancement and OPE convergence. Determine η-η' mixing parameters (small decay constants, large mixing angle) favored by BESIII data. Show predictions for D→η(′)ℓν_ℓ agree well with experiments, but highlight need for future measurements to probe gluonic components.

Conclusion: Current analysis achieves precision matching experimental data, but further improvements in form factors and measurements are needed to fully explore gluonic contributions. Results strengthen understanding of meson mixing and QCD dynamics in charm decays.

Abstract: In light of recent precision measurements from BESIII, we reanalyze the $D, D_s \to η^{(\prime)}$ transition form factors using QCD light-cone sum rules, incorporating high-twist contributions and well-established next-to-leading-order QCD corrections. Our analysis confirms the chiral enhancement effect arising from twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes of the pseudoscalar mesons, and demonstrates a rapid convergence of the operator product expansion. The resulting high-accuracy form factors enable us to determine the optimal $η$-$η^\prime$ mixing parameters from the precise experimental data for the $D, D_s \to η^{(\prime)} \ell^+ ν_\ell$ (with $\ell = e, μ$) differential decay rates. We find that the BESIII data strongly favor a set of mixing parameters, characterized by small decay constants and a large mixing angle, in the quark flavor basis. Notably, the light-cone-sum-rule predictions for the decays $D \to η^{(\prime)} \ell^+ ν_\ell$, induced by weak $c\to d$ current, reach a precision comparable to the BESIII experimental results. Nevertheless, further refined measurements and more accurate form-factor determinations will be essential to scrutinize the potential role of gluonic components in charmed meson semileptonic decays.

### [18] [Top quark FCNC in Randall-Sundrum models: post-LHC allowed rates and searches at $e^+e^-$ and $μ^+ μ^-$ colliders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14966)
*Sagar Airen,Roberto Franceschini*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes sensitivity to Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) in top quark interactions at future electron-positron and muon-muon colliders, considering Ztc vertices and four-fermion contact interactions. It incorporates LHC limits using Randall-Sundrum models and resonances, finding that LHC improves on previous limits, with potential future reach down to BR(t→cZ)≈10^-6. Future machines like Higgs factories (200-240 GeV) and muon colliders (10 TeV) could probe even weaker FCNC couplings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of upcoming colliders (e+, e-, μ+, μ-) in probing top quark FCNCs beyond current LHC constraints, incorporating indirect LHC limits via RS models and direct search improvements. The study aims to assess combined sensitivities and future capabilities.

Method: 1. Examines Ztc vertex and four-fermion contact interactions involving top/charm quarks. 2. Recasts LHC searches for microscopic resonances causing FCNC effects. 3. Derives maximal allowed FCNC coupling strengths constrained by HL-LHC and LEP. 4. Simulates future collider scenarios (Higgs factory, muon collider) to evaluate their reach in BR(t→cZ) and contact interactions.

Result: Current LHC limits on Ztc coupling exceed past LEP indirect results. Direct HL-LHC searches may reach BR(t→cZ)≈1e-6. Future e+e- machines at 200-240 GeV can probe smaller couplings, while 10 TeV muon colliders could access even weaker top-charm contact interactions.

Conclusion: Future colliders will significantly extend FCNC sensitivity beyond HL-LHC. Combining indirect LHC constraints with dedicated searches at Higgs factories and muon colliders could uncover FCNC effects at unprecedented scales (BR≈1e-7-1e-6), probing physics beyond the Standard Model, especially in Randall-Sundrum Randall-Sundrum resonance frameworks.

Abstract: We present the sensitivity to Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) in interactions involving the top quark at future $e^+e^-$ and $μ^+μ^-$ machines. We consider the $Ztc$ vertex as well as four-fermion contact interactions involving top and charm quarks. To incorporate limits from (HL-)LHC we consider FCNC from Randall-Sundrum models and we recast LHC searches for the resonances that at the microscopic level give rise to the FCNC effects. We determine the maximal strength of the effective FCNC couplings $Ztc$ coupling allowed by LHC. We find that the LHC currently improves on the limit set by previous machines, e.g. LEP indirect sensitivity to heavy vectors. Future improvements of direct searches at HL-LHC may reach a level equivalent to $BR(t\to c Z)\simeq 10^{-6}$. We explore the possibility to probe even smaller FCNC coupling strength using an $e^+e^-$ machine at center-of-mass energy suitable for a Higgs factory $E_{cm}\in$ [200,240] GeV or to probe contact interactions involving top and charm flavors at a high-energy muon collider at $E_{cm}=10$ TeV.

### [19] [Combined constraints on dark photons from high-energy collisions, cosmology, and astrophysics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15066)
*A. W. Romero Jorge,L. Sagunski,Guan-Wen Yuan,T. Song,E. Bratkovskaya*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates a dark sector interacting with the Standard Model via a kinetically mixed dark photon, analyzing its production and decay processes using the PHSD transport approach to set constraints on model parameters based on collider data, cosmological considerations, and astrophysical observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the viability of dark photon-mediated dark matter scenarios by combining high-energy collision data from PHSD with cosmological relic density requirements and astrophysical self-interaction constraints, addressing gaps in understanding dark sector interactions.

Method: Extends PHSD transport framework to include dark photon production/decay channels, derives upper limits on kinetic mixing parameter ε² considering visible/invisible regimes, calculates self-interaction cross-sections for SIDM and thermal relic abundance, integrating collider, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints.

Result: Exclusion regions identified in the (mχ,mU) parameter space for different DM types (Dirac, Majorana, scalar), with benchmark models proposed that satisfy all constraints simultaneously by balancing PHSD limits, Planck relic density, and SIDM bounds.

Conclusion: Dark photon models with specific mass couplings and DM realizations can be constrained by combining terrestrial collider data with cosmological-astrophysical limits, offering a coherent framework to narrow down viable dark sector parameter spaces.

Abstract: We investigate a dark sector coupled to the Standard Model (SM) through a kinetically mixed dark photon $U$ associated with a new $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing $\varepsilon$ induces an effective coupling to the electromagnetic current, while $U$ interacts with stable dark matter (DM) $χ$ via a dark gauge coupling $g_χ$. Our analysis is based on the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, extended to include dark photon production and decay into dileptons ($U\!\to e^+e^-$). In PHSD, dark photons are produced in high-energy collisions through Dalitz decays of light mesons ($π^0,η,η',ω$), Delta-resonances ($Δ\!\to N U$), direct vector meson decays ($ρ,ω,φ\!\to U$), kaon decays, and $q\bar q\!\to U$ annihilation. Building on previous PHSD benchmarks against dilepton data, we extract upper limits on $\varepsilon^2(m_U,m_χ,α_χ)$ in both the visible regime ($m_U<2m_χ$), where $U\!\to e^+e^-$ dominates, and the invisible regime ($m_U>2m_χ$), where $U\!\toχ\barχ$ is kinematically open. Cosmological and astrophysical constraints are incorporated in two complementary ways. First, we compute the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section $σ/m_χ$ for Yukawa-mediated SIDM and confront it with bounds from dwarf galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Second, we determine thermal relic target curves by computing the relic abundance and requiring $Ω_{\rm DM}h^2\simeq 0.12$, consistent with \textit{Planck} measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Combining PHSD limits on $\varepsilon^2$ with relic density and self-interaction requirements, we exclude regions of the $(m_χ,m_U)$ plane for each DM realization (Dirac, Majorana, or complex scalar) and identify benchmark scenarios in which heavy-ion, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints are simultaneously satisfied.

### [20] [The Hadron-Parton Bridge, From the QCD Vacuum to Partons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15085)
*Edward Shuryak,Ismail Zahed*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework connecting the rest-frame and high-energy descriptions of hadrons using the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) to derive effective interactions and light-front Hamiltonians, enabling predictions of parton distribution functions and other observables through Wilsonian renormalization and DGLAP/ERBL evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between two complementary QCD descriptions of hadrons—confinement/chiral symmetry breaking at rest and parton distributions at high energy—by providing a coherent multiscale picture rooted in QCD dynamics.

Method: The approach uses the Instanton Liquid Model to model nonperturbative QCD vacuum effects, constructs hadron wave functions in hyperspherical coordinates, boosts them to light-front coordinates, and combines perturbative and instanton-induced dynamics in a Wilsonian framework. This allows calculating parton distributions and form factors, with gradient-flow renormalization linking to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme for perturbative evolution.

Result: The framework consistently describes spectra and partonic structures of various hadrons (quarkonia, glueballs, baryons, etc.) and connects their mechanical properties to QCD dynamics via the energy-momentum tensor. It enables predictions at experimentally accessible scales through DGLAP/ERBL evolution.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively integrates spectroscopy and partonic observables into a single QCD-based picture, providing a comprehensive understanding of hadron structure across different energy regimes and verification of underlying QCD principles.

Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) exhibits complementary descriptions of hadrons: a rest-frame picture based on confinement, chiral symmetry breaking and interquark forces, and a high-energy light-front picture expressed through parton distributions (PDFs,TMDs,GPDs) and form factors. This review develops a unified framework that connects these two domains. It is based mostly on multiple studies by the authors in the past few years. Using the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) to capture essential nonperturbative features of the QCD vacuum, we derive effective interactions for mesons, baryons, and multiquark states, construct their wave functions in hyperspherical coordinates, and boost them to the light front. The resulting light-front Hamiltonians, incorporating both perturbative and instanton-induced dynamics in the Wilsonian spirit, provide realistic nonperturbative inputs for computing PDFs, DAs, GPDs, quasi-distributions, and gravitational form factors at a well-defined low scale. The connection to perturbative QCD is then established by matching gradient-flow-renormalized operators and LF wave functions to the standard $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme. Perturbative DGLAP and ERBL evolution then connects these predictions to experimentally accessible regimes. % This approach is applied to quarkonia, glueballs, light mesons, baryons, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and higher multiquark hadrons, yielding consistent descriptions of both their spectra and partonic structure. Special emphasis is placed on the energy-momentum tensor and the mechanical properties of hadrons, which emerge naturally from the same dynamical ingredients. Overall, the framework demonstrates a clear continuity between hadronic spectroscopy and partonic observables, offering a coherent multiscale picture of hadron structure rooted in the underlying dynamics of QCD.

*A. I. Dembitskaia,Stephane Weiss,M. Yu. Khlopov,M. A. Krasnov*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the possible existence and evolution of local antimatter domains in a baryon-dominated universe, estimating their survival size and analyzing annihilation processes at their boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Standard Model cannot explain the observed baryon asymmetry, so the study explores scenarios where local antimatter regions persist despite surrounding baryonic matter.

Method: The research models the chemical evolution of an isolated antimatter domain, calculates survival size constraints based on annihilation dynamics at the domain boundary, and quantifies matter-antimatter interaction effects.

Result: Estimated domain size parameters and annihilation process impacts are derived, providing constraints on how such antimatter regions could stably exist in the cosmos.

Conclusion: Local antimatter domains may theoretically exist under specific conditions, offering a possible mechanism to address cosmic baryon asymmetry without requiring complete universe-wide solutions.

Abstract: According to modern physics, our Universe is baryon-asymmetric. That phenomenon can not be described in the frameworks of the Standard Model of particle physics. Globally, the Universe consists of baryon matter. However, some scenarios can lead to the existence of local antimatter domains. In the research, the chemical evolution of such an isolated antimatter domain, surrounded by baryonic matter, is studied. The size of the domain is estimated according to the conditions of its survival in baryon surrounding, and the process of annihilation at its border is taken into account.

### [22] [Reassessing CP Violation in the C2HDM with Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15227)
*Rafael Boto,Karim Elyaouti,Duarte Fontes,Maria Gonçalves,Margarete Mühlleitner,Jorge C. Romão,Rui Santos,João P. Silva*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study employs ML techniques, including Evolutionary Strategy and Novelty Reward, to explore the C2HDM parameter space, focusing on large CP-violating couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs. It highlights the importance of kite diagrams and Barr-Zee diagrams with charm loops, enabling viable large fermion CP-odd couplings in Type-II and Flipped C2HDM models despite eEDM constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate regions of the C2HDM parameter space allowing large CP-violating Higgs-fermion couplings consistent with experimental limits, particularly the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM).

Method: Uses Machine Learning (Evolutionary Strategy Algorithm and Novelty Reward) to explore parameter space. Incorporates kite diagrams and Barr-Zee diagrams with charm loops, addressing scale/scheme dependencies in loop calculations.

Result: Large fermion CP-odd couplings are viable in Type-II and Flipped C2HDM when the 125 GeV Higgs is the second lightest scalar, due to milli-scale cancellations that remain valid even at future eEDM precision (~1e-33 e.cm). eEDM constraints are superseded by LHC precision measurements.

Conclusion: ML techniques combined with advanced diagrammatic treatments enable previously excluded C2HDM scenarios with large CP-violation. Future eEDM experiments and LHC data will further constrain these models.

Abstract: We provide a study of the parameter space of the complex 2-Higgs Doublet Model (C2HDM), focusing on signs of large CP-violating couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson with the fermions. The study is performed utilizing Machine Learning (ML) techniques developed recently for parameter space exploration, including an Evolutionary Strategy Algorithm and Novelty Reward. We give particular attention to the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). We confirm that the recently found kite diagrams are crucial for the outcome of the analysis. Moreover, their use also mitigates the dependence of the results on the scale and scheme choice of the masses in the loop diagrams. We furthermore point out that, already at the current level of experimental precision, the Barr-Zee diagrams with charm quark loops must be taken into account. The combined use of kite diagrams and ML techniques allows for the resurrection of large fermion CP-odd couplings for Type-II and Flipped C2HDM when the 125 GeV Higgs coincides with the second lightest neutral scalar. This arises due to cancellations, typically of the per-mil order, which, moreover, will still be possible for a foreseeable eEDM precision down to $10^{-33}$ e.cm. For these cases, the constraints on the CP-odd couplings arises from the precision LHC measurements.

*Arush Pimpalkar,Digvijay Wadekar,Mark Ho-Yeuk Cheung,Emanuele Berti*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: WaveletNet is a wavelet-based neural network designed to identify and reduce non-Gaussian noise (glitches) in gravitational wave data, improving search sensitivity by up to 15% for certain binary systems through efficient glitch modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs require large datasets and struggle with long input segments, while glitches in gravitational wave data share wavelet-like structural properties that can be exploited for more efficient noise mitigation.

Method: WaveletNet uses neural networks to learn optimal wavelet families for modeling glitches in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data, integrates with existing search pipelines like IAS-HM by providing an output score to downweight noisy candidates.

Result: Improved search sensitive volume by 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries when applied to IAS-HM pipeline candidates, demonstrating sample-efficiency over CNNs.

Conclusion: WaveletNet offers a computationally efficient alternative to CNNs for non-Gaussian noise reduction, enhancing gravitational wave detection without requiring extensive data.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{WaveletNet}$, a wavelet-based neural network architecture to identify and reduce non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave data. Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries.

TL;DR: The FRB 2025 conference prioritized accessibility and inclusivity through hybrid formats, low fees, ECR leadership, and educational initiatives, achieving success despite budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce barriers for early career researchers and under-resourced participants in FRB conferences, ensuring community diversity and sustainability.

Method: Hybrid conference model with live streams, low registration costs, ECR-led organization, pedagogical sessions, vegetarian catering, and flash-talks取代posters.

Result: Positive feedback from online participants, particularly on livestreams and recordings; pedagogical day success. Budget challenges in AV management noted, but overall seen as successful.

Conclusion: Highly accessible hybrid conferences are feasible on modest budgets, offering a model for inclusivity in other scientific fields.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) field has been accompanied by a simultaneous growth of FRB conferences. While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montréal in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success. Our experience demonstrates that highly accessible, hybrid conferences are possible within modest budgets ($\$20$k CAD), and we outline recommendations for future conferences, both in the FRB field and in other domains.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces PyISH, a high-fidelity simulation tool designed to model the ultraviolet Integral Field Spectrograph (UV IFS) on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). PyISH aids both scientists in evaluating specific science cases and engineers in exploring instrument design trade-offs. It supports the development of HWO, a telescope aimed at detecting life on exoplanets and performing broader astrophysics research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind developing PyISH is to facilitate the iterative design and optimization of the UV IFS instrument for HWO. This tool helps in assessing scientific feasibility and engineering trade-offs during the development of the observatory's architecture, ensuring the instrument meets both scientific goals and technical constraints.

Method: The method involves creating a modular simulation tool (PyISH) that models the UV IFS's performance for various science cases and engineering configurations. The tool integrates components to simulate data processing, observing scenarios, and instrumental effects, allowing users to test different parameters and architectures.

Result: The paper demonstrates PyISH's capabilities through an example science case simulation, showing its effectiveness in modeling UV IFS observations. The tool has been integrated into the HWO's technology maturation process, aiding in the evaluation of EACs 4 and 5 architectures.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes that PyISH is a critical resource for the HWO project, enabling scientists and engineers to collaboratively refine the UV IFS design. It underscores the importance of such tools in balancing scientific aspirations with engineering realities for future space missions focused on exoplanet biosignatures and deep-space astrophysics.

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be a large ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared space telescope operating at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L2. HWO was highly recommended by the National Academies` 2020 decadal survey and will be the first telescope designed specifically to search for life on planets orbiting other stars. HWO will also be able to perform a host of other transformational astrophysics, including cosmology, galaxy evolution, solar system science, and beyond. The development of the telescope and instrument suite is an iterative process. Example observatory architectures, called exploratory analytic cases (EACs) by the HWO Technology Maturation Project Office (TMPO), are modeled end-to-end to explore the engineering and science trade space. Recently, an ultraviolet Integral Field Spectrograph (UV IFS) was added to HWO's instrument suite for the EACs 4 and 5. To explore the science and engineering trade space for this specific instrument, we developed a high-fidelity UV IFS simulation tool, PyISH. The UV IFS simulation tool is designed to be used by scientists to model specific science cases as seen by a UV IFS on HWO, as well as engineers to explore the trade space when developing potential instrument architectures. The modular components, deliverables, and an example of the tool simulating a specific science case proposed for HWO are described in this paper.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes control algorithms for AO systems with FP-WFSs to mitigate NCP aberrations without additional control stages, improving exoplanet imaging systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AO systems with FP-WFSs face limitations due to NCP aberrations and require costly second-stage control. This work aims to address these issues to facilitate exoplanet imaging advancements.

Method: The authors developed control algorithms augmented within existing AO control setups. They applied temporal filtering to manage inter-arm NCP aberration transfer and validated controller stability through frequency and time-domain analyses.

Result: The proposed methods effectively mitigate NCP aberrations, confirm controller stability, and assess optimality, enabling FP-WFS implementation in exoplanet imaging systems.

Conclusion: The algorithms allow existing AO systems to incorporate FP-WFS technologies without added complexity, paving the way for practical exoplanet direct imaging applications.

Abstract: High-contrast imaging systems using active control with adaptive optics (AO) are often limited by non-common path (NCP) aberrations that are seen only at the final science image. AO systems employing focal-plane wavefront sensors (FP-WFSs) are able to simultaneously correct NCP aberrations and measure science images, but they typically require a second stage of control that adds system cost and complexity. We present control algorithms to augment AO systems with FP-WFSs within their existing control setup. We demonstrate inter-arm NCP aberration transfer can be mitigated through temporal filtering, present frequency- and time-domain validation of controller stability and performance, and discuss the optimality of the chosen controllers. This work will enable the development, testing, and installation of FP-WFS technologies for direct imaging of exoplanets.

### [28] [Comment on "Application of the three-dimensional telegraph equation to cosmic-ray transport" (arXiv:1606.08272)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15125)
*Andrei Galiautdinov*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The authors identify errors in a previously published Green's function solution for the three-dimensional telegraph equation, specifically the absence of a Dirac delta term and an incorrect prefactor, due to improper handling of distributional derivatives. They provide a corrected derivation using Fourier transforms and validate its limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct the flawed Green's function derivation in a prior study, ensuring accurate modeling of heat wave propagation and relativistic heat conduction. The prior work's omissions could lead to incorrect physical interpretations and simulations.

Method: The authors employ the Fourier transform method to rigorously derive the Green's function. They identify the original mistake in the algebraic manipulation of the Heaviside step function's derivative, which neglects distributional derivatives. They then correct this by properly accounting for delta functions arising from such derivatives.

Result: The corrected Green's function includes the necessary Dirac delta term for the ballistic wavefront and fixes the prefactor error in the wake term. The solution satisfies the correct limiting behavior as damping approaches zero, aligning with wave equation solutions.

Conclusion: The study underscores the critical need for rigorous distributional calculus in solving hyperbolic equations like the telegraph equation. The corrected Green's function now provides a reliable mathematical tool for analyzing wavefront phenomena in heat conduction and related fields.

Abstract: In a recent publication [R. C. Tautz and I. Lerche, Res. Astron. Astrophys. 16, 162 (2016); arXiv:1606.08272], the authors present a derivation of the Green's function for the three-dimensional telegraph equation (also known as the heat wave equation, or relativistic heat conduction equation). We demonstrate that the closed-form expression derived in their Appendix A is incorrect. Specifically, the published solution lacks a Dirac delta term representing the ballistic wavefront and contains an algebraic error in the prefactor of the wake term. These omissions arise from the neglect of distributional derivatives when differentiating a Heaviside step function. We provide a rigorous derivation of the Green's function using the Fourier transform method, verify the correct limiting behavior as the damping vanishes, and pinpoint the exact mathematical step where the original derivation failed.

### [29] [The Ep-Liso correlation: A new diagnostic tool for kilonova transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14318)
*Ruben Farinelli,Fabrizio Cogato,Mattia Bulla,Paramvir Singh,Giulia Stratta,Andrea Rossi,Eliana Palazzi,Cristiano Guidorzi,Elisabetta Maiorano,Lorenzo Amati,Bing Zhang,Luciano Rezzolla,Filippo Frontera*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper discovers a new correlation between the peak energy (Ep) and isotropic luminosity (Liso) in the kilonova AT2017gfo, suggesting a diagnostic tool for comparing observations with simulations. This correlation holds up to ~2.5 days post-merger but flattens afterward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the physical mechanisms behind kilonova emission and provide a new method for validating simulation models against observations.

Method: Analyzing time-resolved spectra of AT2017gfo, identifying the Ep-Liso correlation, and comparing with radiative transfer simulations. The correlation is modeled with a logarithmic equation up to 2.5 days post-merger.

Result: A significant correlation exists between Ep and Liso early on, which flattens later. Simulations align with this behavior, confirming the correlation's validity as a diagnostic tool.

Conclusion: The Ep-Liso correlation offers a novel way to test kilonova models. Future observations will refine our understanding of this relationship and underlying physics.

Abstract: The AT2017gfo kilonova transient remains a unique multi-messenger event thanks to its proximity (z=0.00987) and the possibility to investigate time-resolved spectra, providing evidence of r-process nucleosynthesis. The kilonova signal was extensively studied in the spectral and time domains, giving key insights into the chemical composition and physical properties of the ejecta. Here, we report the discovery of a novel correlation between two fundamental observables: the peak energy of the EF_E spectrum, Ep, and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity, Liso. In particular, we show that up to about 2.5 days after the merger, the AT2017gfo spectrum evolves according to: log10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 (+0.02/-0.02) + 0.62 (+0.02/-0.02) * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)] (68% C.L.) while in subsequent epochs, Ep remains almost constant with Liso, flattening around 1 eV. Exploiting simulations from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer code, we demonstrate that our kilonova model inherently predicts this peculiar correlation, suggesting a new diagnostic tool for comparing observables against simulations. Future kilonova observations will provide additional insight into the physics behind the Ep-Liso correlation.

### [30] [Mach $>3$ shocks at the tips of both eROSITA bubbles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14369)
*Uri Keshet,Arka Ghosh*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study uses eROSITA data and edge analysis to identify both tips of a bipolar Galactic bubble system in nonthermal emissions, confirming their origin as evolved remnants of ancient Galactic center outbursts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To confirm the existence of a southern bubble counterpart to Loop-I, measure shock strength, and understand the evolutionary relationship to Fermi Bubbles.

Method: Mapped eROSITA X-ray edges, stacked adjacent radio/γ-ray data parallel to edges using an edge detector, measured spectral jumps to determine shock Mach numbers and environments.

Result: Detected 5σ signals in both radio and γ-rays for both bubble tips; found Mach 3-5 shocks, with southern bubble 10× fainter and entering less dense medium.

Conclusion: The eROSITA bubbles are evolved versions of the Fermi Bubbles, originating from earlier Milky Way center outbursts with different environmental interactions.

Abstract: eROSITA substantiated earlier indications that Loop-I is the northern part of an extended bipolar Galactic-bubble structure, but the southern bubble was not established in nonthermal emission and the shock strength was not robustly measured in either bubble. After using eROSITA data to map the bubble edges, we analyzed edge-adjacent radio and $γ$-ray data to remove foregrounds, test if the southern bubble can be detected in nonthermal emission, and measure the corresponding high-latitude spectra of both bubbles. Data were stacked parallel to the eROSITA bubble edges traced by an edge detector, in the same method used previously to pick up weak signals in the smaller, nested Fermi bubbles; the detected brightness jumps were then used to measure the spectrum. We detect ($>5σ$) both bubble tips in both radio and $γ$-rays, and find a radio spectrum corresponding to high, Mach $3$-$5$ shocks. The southern bubble is fainter, by $\sim$an order of magnitude in radio, its edge propagating into a medium roughly half as dense. The results indicate that these eROSITA bubbles are older, evolved counterparts of the Fermi bubbles, arising from an earlier collimated high-energy outburst from the Galactic center.

### [31] [Fast X-ray transients in NuSTAR data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14375)
*Murray Brightman,Joahan Castañeda Jaimes,Daniel Stern,Brian Grefenstette*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper identifies five hard X-ray transients (FXTs) using NuSTAR data, distinguishing them from soft-band FXTs with their power-law spectra. These FXTs show similarities to low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts and suggest higher event rates in the specified energy range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the origin of enigmatic fast X-ray transients (FXTs) serendipitously found in soft X-ray observations, building on Einstein Probe's findings linking FXTs to gamma-ray bursts and massive star collapses.

Method: Searching the NuSTAR archive in the 3-79 keV band for ~1000s duration transients across 204 Ms exposure time, analyzing their spectra and associations with galaxies.

Result: Five candidate FXTs detected, four with hard spectra (power-law indices -3<Γ<0). Three linked to galaxies at z=0.1-2 with luminosities 10^{43}-10^{48} erg/s and event rates 125-2900 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹, resembling low-luminosity GRBs.

Conclusion: NuSTAR FXTs likely represent a new population of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, more common than their high-luminosity counterparts in this redshift range. This expands understanding of transient phenomena in high-energy astrophysics.

Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are flashes of X-rays that last for a few hundreds of seconds to a few hours. An enigmatic population of these transients that did not have a clear origin has been known for several decades, mostly found serendipitously in soft X-ray imaging observations. Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3<Γ<0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3--79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125--2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The properties of these NuSTAR FXTs most resemble low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, and would be much more common than their higher-luminosity counterparts in this redshift range.

### [32] [The Self-Limiting Nature of Jet-Modulated Thermal Conduction in Cool Core Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14383)
*Jennifer Stafford,Sebastian Heinz,Mateusz Ruszkowski,Torsten Enßlin,Yi-Hao Chen*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the heat pump effect by AGN jets in galaxy clusters through 3D MHD simulations, finding that while conduction efficiency can reach 50% under ideal conditions, it is self-limiting due to magnetic draping, resulting in minimal overall impact on cluster cooling unless conduction is near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AGN jets can enhance thermal conduction between the cool core and hot outer regions of galaxy clusters, addressing the long-standing 'cooling flow' problem where observed cooling is less than expected.

Method: Conducted 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of AGN jets in a Perseus-like cluster, incorporating anisotropic thermal conduction and varying the conductivity suppression factor $f_{m sp}$ by kinetic effects.

Result: Conduction efficiency (η) reaches ~50% of maximum possible when conduction is near Spitzer-Braginskii limit, but drops to ~f_{sp}η_{max} when suppressed. Magnetic draping limits conduction pathways, leading to negligible heat transfer under conservative conductivity assumptions ($f_{sp} \< 0.1$).

Conclusion: Jet-induced heat pumping does not significantly alter cluster thermal evolution beyond existing conduction and jet heating effects, unless thermal conduction remains near theoretical maximum despite kinetic suppression.

Abstract: Conduction as a mechanism for explaining the disrupted cooling-flow in galaxy clusters has been mostly discounted, as the process is inefficient at transporting heat all the way from the cluster into the core. However, thermal conduction can be strongly enhanced when materials of significantly different temperature are brought into proximity, and thus into close thermal contact. Jets of active galactic nuclei may act as heat pumps by bringing low-entropy gas from the cluster core into thermal contact with the hot outer atmosphere of the cluster, significantly increasing the feedback efficiency of active galactic nuclei. We test this hypothesis by running a suite of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of active galactic nuclei jets in a Perseus-like cluster, including anisotropic conduction. We find that the heat pump efficiency $η$ can reach up to 50\% of the maximum possible efficiency $η_{\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $η\approx f_{\rm sp}η_{\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways. Thus, for conservative assumptions about thermal conduction suppression by $f_{\rm sp} \lesssim 0.1$, the heat pump effect leads to only marginal heat transfer and, correspondingly, to immaterial changes in the overall thermal evolution of cool core clusters beyond the isolated effects of conduction and jet-induced heating alone.

### [33] [Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388)
*Wynn C. G. Ho,Esther Simkhayeva,Alexander Y. Potekhin*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of the Vela Junior CCO using XMM-Newton and Chandra data shows it has a hydrogen atmosphere, magnetic field ~3e10 G, and cooler temperatures indicating fast neutrino cooling due to high mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the properties of the Vela Junior CCO's atmosphere, magnetic field, and cooling mechanisms by analyzing its X-ray spectra over time.

Method: Analysis of XMM-Newton MOS/pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra from 2001-2010, fitting all spectra simultaneously with thermal models to determine atmospheric composition, temperatures, absorption lines, and luminosities.

Result: Detected hydrogen atmosphere, temperatures of ~3.5e6 K (hot spot) and ~6.6-8.8e5 K (colder surface), magnetic field ~3e10 G via absorption lines, and luminosities ~5e32 erg/s (hot spot) and 1.3-4e32 erg/s (rest of surface).

Conclusion: The CCO's cooler luminosity and temperature suggest a high mass enabling fast neutrino cooling, consistent with theoretical predictions for such neutron stars.

Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.

### [34] [MeV absorption in gamma-ray bursts as a probe of their progenitor winds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14393)
*Gor Oganesyan,Om Sharan Salafia,Emanuele Sobacchi,Samanta Macera,Giancarlo Ghirlanda,Lara Nava,Annarita Ierardi,Biswajit Banerjee,Alessio Mei,Stefano Ascenzi,Marica Branchesi*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper studies how scattered X-ray photons from GRBs interact with high-energy gamma-rays to create electron-positron pairs, affecting the GRB spectrum. This process produces a distinct absorption feature in the MeV range, which might explain observed spectral curvatures and suggest increased mass loss from progenitor stars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of spectral features in GRBs and their connection to the circumburst environment and progenitor mass loss. Observations of spectral curvatures in bright GRBs need explanation, and studying γ-γ absorption could provide insights into the surrounding medium and progenitor characteristics.

Method: Simulating the interaction of back-scattered X-rays with MeV gamma-rays in a dense, pair-loaded wind environment. Investigating how the low-energy spectral index α influences the resulting spectral absorption structures.

Result: A broad attenuation feature in the prompt GRB spectrum, particularly a saddle-shaped absorption between 1-100 MeV when α > -1. This feature correlates with enhanced leptons in the medium and could explain observed spectral curvatures.

Conclusion: The identified MeV absorption mechanism is a viable explanation for spectral features in GRBs and implies progenitor stars underwent significant mass loss before explosion, aligning with core-collapse supernova observations.

Abstract: A small fraction of X-ray photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), after escaping the relativistic jet, are scattered by electrons in the circumburst medium. Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $γ$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $γ-γ$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $α$. In particular, spectra with $α> -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame). Such external MeV absorption could account for the spectral curvature seen in some bright GRBs, and may point to enhanced mass loss from their progenitor stars, consistent with early observations of core-collapse supernovae.

TL;DR: Investigates erythrohenosis (collision of two red giants) using SPH simulations and analytical models, detailing stages from encounter to explosion. Highlights tidal capture, stellar oscillations, formation of a flattened remnant, and detectable gravitational wave signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolutionary pathway of dense stellar environments through the collision and merger of red giants, which is a key process in stellar dynamics and multi-messenger astronomy.

Method: Combined 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of binary red giants with analytical models to study the event's entire timeline, from initial grazing encounters to terminal explosion, incorporating tidal effects, orbital decay, and angular momentum conservation.

Result: Identified tidal capture leading to rapid orbital decay, nonlinear stellar oscillations, common envelope evolution forming a stable non-spherical equilibrium with luminous bursts, and a flattened remnant with morphomnesia. Gravitational wave signals show rapid frequency evolution and unique chirp mass variations.

Conclusion: Erysrohenosis produces a multi-stage observational signature (transient optical precursors, asymmetric nebulae, gravitational wave anomalies) that enables identification through multi-messenger surveys, advancing stellar merger detection and understanding.

Abstract: We investigate erythrohenosis -- the collision and merger of two red giants -- establishing an end-to-end model for this fundamental evolutionary channel in dense stellar environments. Combining three-dimensional SPH simulations of a binary with analytical modeling, we characterize the event from initial encounter to terminal explosion. We demonstrate that grazing encounters induce tidal capture and rapid orbital decay, accompanied by large-amplitude, nonlinear stellar oscillations. The subsequent inspiral spins up the common envelope into a stable, non-spherical equilibrium, powering a luminous precursor with quasi-periodic bursts. The terminal explosion, modeled with angular momentum conservation, produces an intrinsically flattened remnant that preserves a geometric memory, or morphomnesia, of its binary origin. The associated gravitational wave signal features a rapid, drag-dominated frequency evolution, identifiable by a unique time-varying apparent chirp mass. These results define a distinctive multi-stage observational fingerprint -- linking transient optical precursors, asymmetric nebulae, and anomalous gravitational wave chirps -- to guide identification in current and future multi-messenger surveys.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: POLAR-2's HPD improves gamma-ray burst polarization measurements to distinguish emission mechanisms and constrain physical parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the dominant radiation mechanism (synchrotron vs. inverse-Compton) and constrain outflow properties through high-precision polarization data.

Method: Use the High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) with improved sensitivity and larger detection area, employing time-resolved spectro-polarimetric modeling and unbinned maximum likelihood fitting on synthetic data.

Result: For a given fluence, POLAR-2 can constrain polarization degree with ~2.5% accuracy, enabling differentiation of emission models and revealing emission region dynamics.

Conclusion: HPD's capabilities will advance understanding of GRB physics by providing precise measurements critical for model validation and parameter determination.

Abstract: The dominant radiation mechanism that powers the prompt $γ$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains poorly understood. High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $γ$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events. The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\mathcal{F}_{-5}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\,σ$) of about $2.5\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background. In bright GRBs, such unprecedented accuracy at these energies will allow to distinguish between different models for the prompt GRB emission mechanism and constrain the magnetic field geometry, jet angular structure and outflow composition.

### [37] [Supermassive black hole mass inference with the optical flares of tidal disruption events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14483)
*Andrew Mummery*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using optical/UV flare data from tidal disruption events (TDEs) combined with empirical relationships to estimate black hole masses efficiently, providing a publicly available code (TDEFLARE) that achieves accurate results without requiring late-time data. It also discusses biases in TDE science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage TDEs as a tool for studying quiescent supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their correlations with galaxies, addressing the challenge of deriving SMBH masses from optical/UV observations given current survey limitations.

Method: The authors develop an empirical method linking early optical/UV flares with SMBH masses using known thermal X-ray and UV plateau data. They validate their TDEFLARE code against detailed disk models, test its performance on partial and full disruptions, and analyze the intrinsic SMBH mass function.

Result: TDEFLARE produces mass estimates consistent with complex disk models, recovers galactic scaling relations at high significance, works with partial data, and avoids late-time data reliance. The code yields 89 SMBH mass constraints and assesses Malmquist-Hills bias effects.

Conclusion: TDE emission can effectively constrain SMBH masses through empirical relationships, enabling rapid analysis of upcoming TDEs. The method advances our understanding of SMBH demographics and mitigates observational biases, offering a practical tool for future surveys.

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) represent a truly unique, and potentially very powerful, probe of the quiescent supermassive black hole (SMBH) population. Given current observational survey capabilities the vast majority of the TDEs discovered in the next decade will be observed only across optical-UV wavelengths. A set of questions of broad scientific interest relating to SMBH demographics and SMBH-galaxy correlations could in principal be answered by using TDE emission as an efficient means to constrain SMBH masses. In this paper we argue for using well-understood elements of TDE emission (the thermal X-ray continuum and late-time UV plateau) to derive empirical relationships between the more poorly understood early optical/UV flare and the black hole mass, before using these empirical relationships to measure TDE black hole masses simply and rapidly. We provide a publicly available code TDEFLARE which does this, showing (i) it produces results consistent with disk codes containing far more physics, (ii) it reproduces galactic scaling relationships at high ($>5σ$) significance, (iii) it produces reliable mass estimates for both partial and full disruptions, and (iv) it does not require late time data to derive mass constraints. We provide 89 TDE black hole mass constraints, derive the intrinsic black hole mass function implied by the current TDE population, and discuss the Malmquist-Hills bias, an important confounding factor in TDE science.

### [38] [The failed failed-supernova scenario of M31-2014-DS1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14497)
*Noam Soker*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of the M31-2014-DS1 event challenges the failed-supernova scenario, proposing an alternative dust-ejection mechanism


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if the failed-supernova explanation requiring fine-tuned parameters for M31-2014-DS1 is viable

Method: Assessing the physical feasibility of parameters (jet lifespan, accretion efficiency, radiative cooling) in the failed-supernova model

Result: The model's requirements (like <1% accretion efficiency and 10+ year jet activity) are implausible, plus observed brightness vs predicted cooling mismatch

Conclusion: The failed-supernova scenario is unlikely for this event; a binary interaction-driven dust ejection scenario is better supported

Abstract: I examine a recently proposed failed-supernova scenario for the fading of the yellow supergiant event M31-2014-DS1, and find that it requires unlikely fine-tuned parameters to work, if at all. In the failed-supernova scenario, most of the yellow supergiant collapsed to form a black hole. Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only <1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely. The fading event M31-2014-DS1 does not support the failed-supernova scenario predicted by the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.

### [39] [Searching for Isolated Black Hole Candidates within 15 pc of the Solar System in Gaia DR3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14499)
*Abdurakhmon Nosirov,Cosimo Bambi,Leda Gao,Jos de Bruijne,Jiachen Jiang,Andrea Santangelo,Fu-Guo Xie*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explores the possibility of detecting isolated stellar-mass black holes in the local interstellar medium near the Solar System. It identifies five candidate sources from Gaia DR3 data but cautions that these are likely spurious due to astrometric challenges, emphasizing the need for follow-up observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the existence of isolated black holes within 15 pc of the Sun and assess potential detection methods, addressing gaps in observational data versus theoretical predictions.

Method: Analyzed Gaia DR3 catalog to search for black holes accreting interstellar medium, focusing on candidates near the Galactic plane, and considered astrophysical and observational uncertainties.

Result: Identified five candidate black holes, but all are likely spurious due to crowded fields and binary star effects; no conclusive detection achieved yet.

Conclusion: Current data insufficient for definitive identification, highlighting needs for future observatories with better resolution and follow-up studies of candidates to confirm or rule out detections.

Abstract: Theoretical models predict that the Galaxy hosts $10^8$-$10^9$ black holes formed from the complete gravitational collapse of heavy stars and that most of these black holes are isolated, without any companion. Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources. All candidates lie close to the Galactic plane, making them likely spurious astrometric solutions, for instance caused by unmodelled background sources (crowding) and/or unmodelled binarity; nevertheless, they cannot be definitively ruled out without follow-up observations.

### [40] [Exotic optical variability in the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14540)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study presents the first long-term optical monitoring of IGR J17091-3624, a black hole X-ray binary with heartbeat oscillations. The optical and X-ray fluxes are strongly correlated, supporting an X-ray-irradiated disk origin for the optical emission. The observed extinction and distance estimates align with previous studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the optical and X-ray emission mechanisms of IGR J17091-3624, particularly its heartbeat oscillations and jet/disc behavior, due to its accessibility compared to heavily obscured systems like GRS 1915+105.

Method: Long-term optical monitoring using LCO during 2011, 2016, and 2022 outbursts, combined with X-ray data from Swift/XRT, RXTE, and NICER. Analyses include light curve variability, spectral energy distributions, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical/X-ray correlations.

Result: Optical/X-ray flux correlation with index 0.40±0.04, suggesting X-ray-irradiated disk dominance. Estimated extinction A_V 4.3–6.6 mag and distance 8–17 kpc. Tentative optical oscillations linked to reprocessed X-ray modulations observed.

Conclusion: The optical emission is primarily from X-ray-irradiated disk processes. The system's characteristics (extinction, distance) align with prior data. Higher time-resolution optical data needed to confirm oscillation origins.

Abstract: IGR J17091-3624 is a distinctive black hole X-ray binary exhibiting exotic variability, including complex "heartbeat" oscillations in its X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in GRS 1915+105, a system renowned for its structured, rapid X-ray variability but heavily obscured at optical wavelengths. In contrast, IGR J17091-3624 is less obscured, making it a more accessible target for optical investigations. Due to its weak radio emission, optical and infrared data are essential to probe the jet and outer disc behavior of IGR J17091-3624. This study presents the first long-term optical monitoring of IGR J17091-3624, using data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) over its 2011, 2016, and 2022 outbursts. We combine these observations with quasi-simultaneous X-ray data from Swift/XRT, RXTE, and NICER, employing light curve and variability analysis, spectral energy distributions, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical/X-ray correlations to investigate optical emission mechanisms. We find that the optical and X-ray fluxes are significantly correlated, following a power-law relation with the index 0.40\pm0.04, suggesting that the optical emission in IGR J17091-3624 is dominated by an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk. Based on optical spectral slope constraints, we estimate the extinction toward IGR J17091-3624 A_V = 4.3 to 6.6 mag. The global optical/X-ray correlation suggests a distance estimate of 8-17 kpc, in line with previous findings. High-cadence optical observations show tentative evidence of optical oscillations that may arise from reprocessed X-ray modulations, although confirming this will require higher time-resolution optical data.

TL;DR: The study uses HAWC Observatory data to search for axion-like particles (ALPs) through their potential photon conversion effects, ruling them out in certain parameter ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Axion-like particles are potential dark matter candidates whose existence can be probed via photon-ALP conversions in magnetic fields. This work aims to test this through attenuation in gamma-ray spectra.

Method: Analyzing high-energy gamma rays from galactic source 3HWC J1908+063 using HAWC data to detect photon-ALP conversions causing spectral attenuation.

Result: No evidence of photon-ALP conversions found; exclusion limits set for ALP masses (10^-8 to 10^-6 eV) and photon couplings (10^-12 to 10^-10 GeV⁻¹).

Conclusion: Constraints on ALP parameter space refine dark matter models, narrowing viable mass-coupling combinations.

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles and compelling candidates for cold dark matter. Their existence could be probed through their conversions into photons in the presence of magnetic fields. In this work, we explore the effect of these photon-ALP conversions by searching for an attenuation in the observed gamma ray spectra of galactic sources that emit at energies of hundreds of TeV. We analyze data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory for the source 3HWC J1908+063. No evidence of photon-ALP conversions was found, and we set constraints on the ALP parameter space. Specifically, we derive exclusion limits for ALPs with masses in the range $10^{-8}~\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-6}~\mathrm{eV}$ and photon-ALP couplings in the range $10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \leq g_{aγ} \leq 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, based on HAWC observations.

TL;DR: The study used the muon correlation method to analyze cosmic ray composition in the energy range 2-12.5 EeV, identifying four distinct particle groups with different origins, contributing to understanding cosmic ray composition at these energies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the composition of cosmic rays in the 2-12.5 EeV energy range by examining individual air showers, which helps resolve the origins and nature of these high-energy particles.

Method: The muon correlation method was applied to air shower data (1974-2018) with zenith angles <60°, analyzing muon content to classify cosmic ray primaries into four groups based on their origins.

Result: Confirmed existence of four distinct primary particle groups with different origins, providing valuable insights into cosmic ray composition across the studied energy range.

Conclusion: The findings advance understanding of cosmic ray sources and their composition in the specified energy range, emphasizing the muon correlation method's effectiveness for such analyses.

Abstract: The results of a study of the cosmic ray composition in individual events in the energy range (2-12.5) EeV using the muon correlation method is presented. The considered sample included showers with zenith angles less than 60 degrees recorded in the period 1974-2018. The existence of four separate groups of primary particles with different origins is confirmed. The obtained results have potential importance for understanding the composition of cosmic rays in the specified primary energy range.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study of black hole binary 4U 1630-472 reveals an anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets. During the observed outbursts, only one type of outflow was present at a time despite stable accretion luminosity, indicating a competition between outflow mechanisms linked to energy partitioning in accretion disks and coronae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the formation of disk winds and jets in accreting black holes, and to resolve debates on how these outflows coexist or compete under similar accretion conditions.

Method: Analysis of coordinated NICER (X-ray) and MeerKAT (radio) observations of 3 outbursts in 4U 1630-472, focusing on the temporal relationship between disk winds and jets during periods of consistent accretion luminosity.

Result: Observed anti-correlation where disk winds and jets do not coexist; only one outflow type is active at a time even when accretion luminosity remains in the soft-state range, suggesting competition for accretion energy resources.

Conclusion: The exclusivity of winds/jets implies energy partitioning between the accretion disk and corona determines outflow dominance. This challenges previous assumptions and provides constraints for models of accretion-powered feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Accretion onto black holes often leads to the launch of outflows that significantly influence their surrounding environments. The two primary forms of these outflows are X-ray disk winds-hot, ionized gases ejected from the accretion disk-and relativistic jets, which are collimated streams of particles often expelled along the rotational axis of the black hole. While previous studies have revealed a general association between spectral states and different types of outflows, the physical mechanisms governing wind and jet formation remain debated. Here, using coordinated NICER and MeerKAT observations of the recurrent black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472, we identify a clear anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets: during three recent outbursts, only one type of outflow is detected at a time. Notably, this apparent exclusivity occurs even as the overall accretion luminosity remains within the range expected for a standard thin disk, characteristic of the canonical soft state. These results suggest a competition between outflow channels that may depend on how the accretion energy is partitioned between the disk and the corona. Our findings provide new observational constraints on jet and wind formation in X-ray binaries and offer a fresh perspective on the interplay between different modes of accretion-driven feedback.

*Natsuki Terano,Takaaki Tanaka,Hiromasa Suzuki,Rei Enokiya,Hiroyuki Uchida,Kai Matsunaga,Takuto Narita,Yasuo Fukui,Toshiki Sato*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study investigates the association between supernova remnant G284.3-1.8 and the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6-5856, finding they likely share a common origin through a supernova explosion that produced a neutron star.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the physical connection between the supernova remnant G284.3-1.8 and the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6-5856, confirming their distance relationship and determining their origin.

Method: Used Suzaku X-ray spectroscopy to measure absorption column density, NANTEN CO data for distance estimation, and compared Mg/Ne/Si mass ratios against stellar models with shell merger processes.

Result: Both systems share similar distances (~3 kpc), G284.3-1.8 is Mg-rich, and the mass ratios support a neutron star remnant. The gamma-ray binary's characteristics align with a neutron star model.

Conclusion: G284.3-1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6-5856 may both originate from the same supernova event producing a neutron star, though observational confirmation is needed.

Abstract: G284.3$-$1.8 is a supernova remnant with a radio shell and thermal X-ray emission. Located near its center is the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, although the physical association between the two systems is not clear yet. Our X-ray spectroscopy with Suzaku reveals that G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 have compatible absorption column densities of $N_\mathrm{H} = 6\textrm{--}7 \times 10^{21}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, indicating that the two systems have similar distances. The actual distance is determined as $3~\mathrm{kpc}$ using $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ ($J=1\textrm{--}0$) data obtained with NANTEN. The X-ray spectrum of G284.3$-$1.8 shows a strong K-shell emission line of Mg, confirming that the earlier claim that the SNR is one of the few Mg-rich SNRs. Comparing recent stellar models taking into account the "shell merger" processes, we find that the obtained Mg-to-Ne mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Mg}/M_\mathrm{Ne} = 0.73^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and Si-to-Mg mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Si}/M_\mathrm{Mg} = 0.44\pm0.03$ suggest a supernova explosion that would have left a neutron star. The characteristics of 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, on the other hand, are better explained with a model in which its compact object is neutron star. The present results, therefore, would suggest a possible scenario where G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 are both remnants of a common supernova explosion although further observational tests are necessary.

TL;DR: The study of SN 2023zcu provides insights into Type IIP supernovae by analyzing its light curves and spectra, estimating progenitor mass and explosion parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand Type IIP supernovae progenitors and explosions through detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis.

Method: Combining optical/UV observations, spectral modeling with TARDIS, and EPM fitting to derive temperatures, velocities, and distance. Nebular-phase analysis and bolometric modeling were used for progenitor mass estimation.

Result: Measured an 100.6-day optically thick phase, 27.8 Mpc distance estimate, and 12-15 solar mass progenitor. Found weak CSM interaction and typical Type IIP spectral features.

Conclusion: The analysis confirms key properties of Type IIP SNe, supporting models where massive red supergiants explode with moderate CSM interaction.

Abstract: We present a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type IIP supernova SN~2023zcu, which exploded in the galaxy NGC~2139 (redshift $z$ = 0.006). SN~2023zcu exhibits a well-sampled light curve covering the rise, plateau, and nebular phases. It has an optically thick phase of $100.6 \pm 0.6$ d with a magnitude drop of $\sim$1.7 mag in the {\em V} band during the transition between the plateau and the nebular phases. Weak emission features in the early-time spectra indicate a low-level interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. The spectral evolution is well sampled and exhibits a prominent P-Cygni profile of H$α$, a defining characteristic of Type IIP SNe. Signatures of metal-line formation (e.g., \ion{Fe}{2}, \ion{Ca}{2} near-infrared triplet) are also evident in the spectra as the SN evolves. Spectral modeling with the radiative-transfer code \texttt{TARDIS} during the early photospheric phase (8.7--35.5 d since explosion) yields photospheric temperatures decreasing from $\sim$9,000 to $\sim$6,000 K and expansion velocities declining from $\sim$10,000 to $\sim$5,400 km s$^{-1}$. A tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) fit based on the \texttt{TARDIS} models provides a distance estimate of $27.8 \pm 2.0$ Mpc. Nebular-phase spectra and bolometric light-curve modeling suggest a progenitor mass in the range 12--15 M$_\odot$. This thorough analysis helps to constrain progenitor properties and explosion parameters, thereby strengthening our understanding of Type IIP SNe.

### [46] [Modeling X-ray reflection spectra from returning radiation: application to 4U 1630$-$47](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14860)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new XSPEC reflection model that self-consistently incorporates returning radiation to study disk illumination in black hole X-ray binaries. Applied to 4U 1630−47, it reveals a rapidly spinning black hole (a*~0.99) with specific disk parameters, and suggests a lower source distance than previously believed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incomplete inclusion of returning radiation in existing XSPEC models and accurately model disk self-illumination effects in high-soft state black hole systems.

Method: Developed a new table model disabling corona in disk-corona geometry so reflection arises solely from disk self-irradiation. Applied this model to observational data of 4U 1630−47 for parameter estimation.

Result: Derived parameters include high spin (a*~0.99), disk inclination ~53°, 15% Eddington accretion rate, plasma density 1e21 cm⁻³, and distance ~8.2 kpc. Model produces harder reflection spectra than relxillNS without needing extra Comptonization.

Conclusion: Returning radiation significantly impacts disk reflection spectra. The new model provides better consistency for certain X-ray binaries and suggests prior distance estimates for 4U 1630−47 may be overestimated.

Abstract: Returning radiation is thought to play a key role in disk illumination of black hole X-ray binaries in the high-soft state, yet it has not been fully incorporated into XSPEC reflection models. We present a new table model for reflection spectroscopy that, for the first time, self-consistently accounts for the returning radiation. To isolate this effect, we adopt the standard disk-corona configuration but disable the corona, allowing the reflection spectrum to be produced solely by self-irradiation of the disk. Applying our model to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630$-$47, we report a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_* \sim 0.99$), a disk inclination of $i \sim 53^\circ$, a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm BH} \sim 15\% \, {\rm \dot{M}_{Edd}}$, and an electron density of $n_{\rm e} \sim 10^{21} \,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to reproduce the observed reflection features. The model also yields a source distance of $D\sim 8.2 \, {\rm kpc}$, slightly below the commonly adopted value of $10 \, {\rm kpc}$ in the literature. Compared to the widely used relxillNS, our model naturally produces a harder high-energy reflection spectrum, fitting the data without invoking a Comptonized component.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ability of LISA gravitational wave observations of EMRIs to constrain astrophysical properties of massive black hole populations using hierarchical Bayesian inference, showing that even with limited detections and model inaccuracies, key population features can be identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of LISA to perform statistical studies on massive black hole demographics and formation pathways through EMRI detections, understanding constraints of population models under various scenarios.

Method: Simulated EMRI catalogues were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian inference. The study tested different population models (homogeneous, heterogeneous, misspecified) to evaluate parameter constraints and model accuracy.

Result: Population parameters with sharp features were tightly constrained. Mixed populations could be resolved with ~20 detections, and even misspecified models retained sensitivity to key features. This demonstrates both the potential and limits of EMRI population analysis.

Conclusion: LISA's EMRI data can effectively constrain black hole population properties despite model uncertainties. Results guide development of realistic astrophysical models for LISA's data analysis framework.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will enable sub-percent measurements of massive black hole parameters and provide access to the demographics of compact objects in galactic nuclei. During the LISA mission, multiple EMRIs are expected to be detected, allowing statistical studies of massive black hole populations and their formation pathways. We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on simulated EMRI catalogues to assess how well LISA could constrain the astrophysical population using parametrised population models. We test our inference framework on a variety of populations, including heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures of parametrised subpopulations, and scenarios in which the assumed model is deliberately misspecified. Our results show that population parameters governing distributions with sharp features can be tightly constrained. Mixed populations can be disentangled with as few as $\sim20$ detections, and even with model misspecification, the inference retains sensitivity to key population features. These results demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of EMRI population inference, providing guidance for constructing realistic astrophysical population models for LISA analysis.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive model for dephasing caused by line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) in gravitational wave signals from binary black holes (BBHs) in three-body systems. It evaluates the detectability of LOSA effects with the Einstein Telescope (ET), showing potential for distinguishing dynamical vs. AGN origins of BBHs. Analysis of GW190814 and O4a events found no significant LOSA evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of previous local-expansion-based models which neglect curvature and projection-dependent phase effects from LOSA. The aim is to quantify the detectability of LOSA in three-body BBH systems and their utility in constraining tertiary parameters to distinguish formation channels.

Method: Developed a complete LOSA dephasing model beyond local expansions, conducted parameter-space surveys and mock ET parameter inferences, analyzed GW190814 and O4a events using extended data segments.

Result: ET could detect 3-30 such systems/year if all dynamical mergers occur. LOSA allows constraints on tertiary mass/distance for some systems. Reanalysis removed earlier GW190814 LOSA claims by using longer datasets.

Conclusion: LOSA effects are detectable with ET and useful for differentiating BBH formation scenarios. Prior claims about GW190814 require caution due to data length biases.

Abstract: We introduce a complete model for dephasing due to line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) in gravitational wave (GW) signals from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) in three-body systems. Our prescription provides curvature- and projection-dependent phase features that are not recovered by local-expansion-based treatments. We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs. Finally, we reanalyse the GW190814 event and four O4a events finding no evidence for LOSA, with the previously claimed LOSA in GW190814 disappearing when a sufficiently long data segment is used.

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-wavelength analysis of the blazar S5 1044+71 using Fermi-LAT and Swift data, revealing significant γ-ray variability, spatial constraints on the emission region, energy-dependent flux correlations, and a leptonic emission model involving EC scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the temporal behavior, spectral properties, and emission mechanisms of the blazar S5 1044+71 through coordinated multi-wavelength observations.

Method: Applied Bayesian block analysis to Fermi-LAT γ-ray lightcurves, analyzed UV/optical-X-ray data from Swift-XRT/UVOT, performed spectral energy distribution modeling, and cross-correlation analysis between bands.

Result: Identified four major γ-ray outbursts with short variability timescale (4.5 hours), detected high-energy photons outside flare peaks, observed increasing fractional variability from UV to γ-rays, found X-ray lag behind γ-rays, and confirmed a leptonic EC model with specific emission zone parameters during flares.

Conclusion: The results constrain the emission region near the BLR, indicate multiplicative variability processes, and support a one-zone leptonic model where particle acceleration and magnetic field changes dominate the spectral state transitions during flares.

Abstract: We present a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the blazar S5\,1044+71 using multi-wavelength data obtained from the \emph{Fermi}-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT telescopes. Applying the Bayesian block algorithm to the 3-day binned $γ$-ray lightcurve, we identify pronounced variability, including four major outbursts marked by significant flux enhancements. The highest flux recorded was $(1.1 \pm 0.2)\times 10^{-6}\,\text{ph}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ on 57868.5 MJD. Each outburst comprises multiple components, and lightcurve profile analysis indicates predominantly symmetric temporal structures. The shortest variability timescale of 4.5 hours constrains the emission region to be located within 0.03 pc of the central engine, likely near the broad-line region (BLR). Additionally, two highest-energy photons were detected with energies of 46.4 GeV (on 57739.6 MJD) and 42.5 GeV (on 59161.9 MJD), observed outside the peak flaring activity. The fractional variability shows an overall increasing trend from UV/optical to $γ$-ray bands, with a noticeable dip in the X-ray range, consistent with the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). The flux distributions during flares exhibit log-normal or double log-normal behavior, suggesting multiplicative variability processes and evolving emission zones. Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the $γ$-ray and X-ray bands, with X-rays lagging by 42.5 days. Broadband SED modeling across different flux states supports a one-zone leptonic scenario, with $γ$-ray emission produced via external Compton scattering of IR and BLR photons. High-flux states show harder electron spectra, elevated break energies, and reduced magnetic fields-features consistent with efficient particle acceleration and Compton dominance.

TL;DR: The Gaia Alerts system detects photometric changes in celestial objects, with 13% of over 22,000 alerts being AGN/quasar candidates. Spectroscopic follow-up confirmed 64 new AGN/quasars and observed 200 known AGN with variability. Phenomena include flares, TDEs, 56 CLQs, and rarer events. Variability helps discover otherwise missed radio-quiet quasars, with ~10% of variable AGN showing CLQ behavior.

Motivation: To characterize photometrically variable AGN/quasars detected by Gaia Alerts and identify underlying phenomena causing their brightness changes, particularly focusing on radio-quiet objects.

Method: Spectroscopic follow-up of Gaia alerts on ~13% AGN/quasar candidates, including new candidates and known AGN. Analysis of spectral data to classify events like CLQs, TDEs, flares, and others. Separation of radio-quiet and radio-loud analyses for future companion paper.

Result: Confirmed 64 new AGN/quasars, observed 200+ known variable AGN. Identified 56 secure and 23 probable CLQs, along with other phenomena. Highlighted variability as a tool for discovering radio-quiet quasars and found ~10% of variable AGN are CLQs.

Conclusion: Gaia Alerts enable discovery of variable AGN phenomena, especially radio-quiet quasars. CLQs are common (~10% occurrence) among variable AGN, warranting further monitoring to understand time scales and mechanisms.

Abstract: The Gaia Alerts system is providing alerts on a variety of objects displaying a significant photometric change detected by the Gaia satellite from one passage to the next one over the same region of the sky. Among the over 22000 alerts published until the end of 2022, around 13 percent concern AGN or quasar candidates. We have embarked on a spectroscopic ground-based follow-up of some of those (including some selected by a different method specifically in galactic nuclei), to establish their true nature, and reveal the various phenomena leading to a change in magnitude of those AGN. The present paper deals with radio-quiet objects, while the radio-loud ones will be described in a companion paper. We confirm, on one hand, the AGN/quasar nature of 64 new candidates alerted by Gaia, and, on the other hand, obtained second-epoch spectra of over 200 known AGN also alerted for large photometric variations. The observed phenomena show a large variety: from Flares to Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and a large number of Changing Look Quasars (CLQs, 56 secure ones, plus 23 probable ones), not forgetting some rarer events like SNe, microlensing events or Extreme Coronal Line Emitters. This sample shows that variability is an excellent tool to detect new quasars, especially radio-quiet ones that otherwise would be undetected, and that a significant fraction of variable AGN/quasars, around 10 percent, presents the CLQ phenomenon. Some of the new CLQs are followed-up to monitor further changes and measure time scales.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study examines how self-gravity affects collapsar jets' properties (opening angle, power, Lorentz factor, variability) through GRMHD simulations. It finds self-gravity causes temporary jet quenching, alters jet structure, and may explain gamma-ray burst features, though jet launch times remain similar with or without self-gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the impact of self-gravity on jet formation and propagation in collapsars, which is critical for understanding gamma-ray burst dynamics and observational features like prompt emission variability.

Method: Time-dependent 3D GRMHD simulations comparing self-gravitating and non-self-gravitating collapsar models under identical initial conditions. The Kerr metric evolves with black hole mass and spin changes, incorporating self-gravity via perturbative terms.

Result: Self-gravity causes temporary jet quenching, narrower opening angles, and altered energy extraction without significantly changing jet launch times. Failed bursts can occur under certain self-gravitating conditions. Jet variability and timescales are strongly influenced by self-gravity inclusion.

Conclusion: Self-gravity significantly modifies collapsar jet properties, offering explanations for observed gamma-ray burst features. Future models must incorporate self-gravity for accurate jet dynamics predictions.

Abstract: We investigate collapsar models with and without self-gravity under identical initial conditions to directly compare the effects of self-gravity on jet properties, such as opening angle, jet power, terminal Lorentz factor, and its variability. We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.

*Ji-Shun Lian,Jia-Xuan Li,Ze-Rui Wang,Rui-Qi Huang,Hai-Ming Zhang,Jin Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Analysis of 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs) using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data reveals stable GeV emission with hard power-law spectra. SEDs are modeled using a one-zone SSC model requiring higher electron energies and show low magnetization and radiation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets by analyzing extreme synchrotron blazars which have unique SED characteristics.

Method: Systematic analysis of ~16-year Fermi-LAT data for 25 EHBLs, combined with multiwavelength observations. Broadband SEDs were constructed and fitted with a one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model.

Result: Most EHBLs show stable GeV flux with photon indices 1.7-1.8. The SSC model fits SEDs but needs higher electron energies and underpredicts UV emission. Jet properties show low magnetization and radiation efficiency.

Conclusion: EHBLs exhibit distinct emission characteristics requiring modified SSC models, reinforcing their role as low-magnetization, high-energy particle accelerators in relativistic jets.

Abstract: Extreme synchrotron blazars, characterized by a first peak in their broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at frequencies exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz, often exhibit a second peak beyond 1~TeV. These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$σ$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $γ$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $γ$-ray emitting HBLs. Consistent with other GeV--TeV $γ$-ray-emitting BL Lacs, the jets in these EHBLs are marked by low radiation efficiency and low magnetization.

### [53] [The early r-process nucleosynthesis scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15187)
*Noam Soker*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study analyzes seven r-process nucleosynthesis scenarios in the early Universe, finding that magnetorotational and CEJSN scenarios best explain elements below and at the third peak respectively. Other scenarios are less significant, and further exploration of CEJSN diversity is suggested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which r-process scenarios best explain observed r-process element properties in early Universe objects like metal-poor stars, focusing on abundance scatter, light r-process/iron correlations, and third peak/iron lack of correlation.

Method: Comparison of seven scenarios against observations of r-process elements in very metal-poor stars, evaluating their ability to explain specific abundance patterns and correlations.

Result: Magnetorotational scenario explains elements below third peak; CEJSN explains third peak. Collapsar/CEJSN may contribute to lighter elements; NS-NS mergers might contribute to third peak. Magnetar wind, NS wind, and WD collapse scenarios are less significant.

Conclusion: CEJSN's diversity should be explored further. Valid r-process scenarios must explain observed abundance scatter and correlations distinct from iron production levels.

Abstract: I compare seven actively studied r-process nucleosynthesis scenarios against observed properties of r-process elements in the early Universe, and conclude that the most likely scenario to contribute to the site of elements below the third r-process peak is the magnetorotational r-process scenario, and that of the third peak is the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario. The collapsar and CEJSN r-process scenario might also contribute to the lighter r-process elements, and the binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger r-process scenario might contribute to the third r-process peak. The magnetar, the wind from the newly born NS, and the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf r-process scenarios fall short in explaining observations. They might exist, but cannot be major contributors to the r-process in the early Universe. To constrain r-process scenarios in the early Universe, I require that they explain the large scatter in the r-process abundances of very metal-poor stars, account for the correlation between light r-process nucleosynthesis and iron production, and the lack of correlation between the third peak r-process production and iron production, as inferred from very metal-poor stars. I discuss the diversity of the CEJSN r-process scenario and encourage extending its exploration.

### [55] [Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Black Hole Gravitational Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14303)
*Chengjiang Yin,Zihao Lin,Jian-hua He*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores how quasi-normal modes (QNMs) are excited in gravitational lensing around a Schwarzschild black hole using a scalar field model, revealing significant high-l mode excitations and a coherent Gaussian beam formation post-scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex interaction between incident gravitational waves and black hole spacetime, particularly focusing on non-resonant excitation of high-l QNMs and the resulting wave behavior after lensing.

Method: Time-domain mode-sum method applied to a scalar field model, with QNM template fitting to analyze late-time behavior, examining wave scattering through a Schwarzschild black hole.

Result: High-l modes (up to l=20) show substantial amplitudes, lensed waves form a directional Gaussian beam with constant near-field intensity, and QNM superposition cancels oscillations, suppressing traditional oscillatory patterns.

Conclusion: Gravitational lensing by black holes can非线性产生高度定向的高斯波束，而非传统的球面波，且高频QNMs通过非共振激发，其叠加效应抑制了振荡，这为观测和理论模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the excitation of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in gravitational lensing by a Schwarzschild black hole using a scalar field model. By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns.

### [56] [From MOND entropy to extended uncertainty principles: A unified framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14353)
*Özgür Sevinç,Özgür Ökcü,Ekrem Aydiner*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study explores connections between generalised entropies and extended uncertainty principle models, deriving modified Friedmann equations through multiple approaches. It introduces a 'MOND EUP' by reversing the process from a MOND entropy, showing it can unify various entropies and EUP models, suggesting a framework linking cutoff mechanisms and EUP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a unified framework connecting generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models by exploring their interdependencies and deriving new EUP models from entropy-based approaches.

Method: Starting from HOEUP, modified entropy-area relations and Friedmann equations are derived via three thermodynamic approaches. The validity of the GSL is checked. A novel MOND EUP is formulated by reversing the process from a MOND entropy, linking it to Rényi and dual Kaniadakis entropies.

Result: MOND EUP unifies multiple entropy models, with HOEUP as a limiting case of MOND entropy. The reverse procedure from entropy to EUP is demonstrated, suggesting a broader applicability to other entropies.

Conclusion: The reverse method from entropy to EUP opens avenues for a unified framework, implying EUP models may inherently provide cutoff mechanisms even for entropies without explicit cutoffs, advancing theories in quantum gravity and cosmology.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the relation between generalised entropies and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) models. Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with Rényi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analytically construct discretely self-similar solutions for critical gravitational collapse, which were previously only known numerically, and to understand their properties compared to finite-dimensional cases.

Method: Applied large-D expansion technique to derive closed-form solutions for the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon system, analyzing their structure and behavior.

Result: Obtained an infinite family of discretely self-similar solutions, identified universal features matching numerical results and distinct behaviors specific to large dimensions.

Conclusion: Analytic solutions provide new insights into critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, bridging numerical observations with theoretical predictions, and highlight dimensional effects on solution structure.

Abstract: Discretely self-similar solutions govern critical gravitational collapse and have been known only numerically since Choptuik's pioneering work. We construct, in closed analytic form, an infinite family of such solutions of the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon system using the large-D expansion. We characterize their structure and compare them with numerical critical solutions at finite D, identifying both universal features and distinctly large-D behavior.

### [58] [Higher Harmonics of Double White Dwarfs in the Centihertz Band: Linking LISA and DECIGO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14578)
*Naoki Seto*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines the detectability of higher-order post-Newtonian harmonics from Galactic double white dwarf binaries in the centihertz band and finds that while LISA cannot detect these beyond rare cases, future decihertz observatories like DECIGO and BBO can detect third harmonics for ~10% of inspiral binaries above 5 mHz, enabling mass ratio constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of current and future space-based gravitational wave detectors (LISA, DECIGO, BBO) to detect higher harmonics from double white dwarf binaries, which is critical for understanding their population statistics and testing general relativity.

Method: A synthetic population of double white dwarf binaries was modeled to simulate detectability of higher harmonics in centihertz (LISA) and decihertz bands. Signal analysis compared quadrupole mode detectability with higher harmonics using post-Newtonian approximations.

Result: Higher harmonics are undetectable by LISA except for rare nearby systems. DECIGO/BBO can detect third harmonics in ~10% of binaries above 5 mHz, allowing statistical analysis of mass ratios. This underscores the need for coordinated strategies between LISA and future missions.

Conclusion: Future mid-band observatories are essential for detecting higher harmonics and constraining binary parameters, complementing LISA's role in lower frequencies. A coherent multi-mission approach is necessary for advancing space-based gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: We investigate the detectability of post-Newtonian higher harmonics from Galactic double white dwarfs in the centihertz band ($\sim 0.01$ Hz). Using a synthetic population, we show that, unlike the quadrupole mode, higher harmonics remain undetectable with LISA except for rare nearby systems. In contrast, planned mid-band (decihertz) observatories such as DECIGO and BBO will be able to detect the third harmonic for about 10\% of inspiral binaries above $\sim 5$ mHz, enabling statistical constraints on mass ratios. These results highlight the successive roles of LISA and future decihertz missions in establishing a coherent strategy for space-based gravitational-wave astronomy.

### [59] [The role of angular momentum in general relativity: heuristic and covariant interpretations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14664)
*Erick Pasten,Claudia Alvarez,Norman Cruz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of angular momentum in general relativity by comparing Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. It uses an effective-potential approach and covariant 1+3 formalism to show how black hole spin modifies gravitational focusing through shear effects on infalling matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify conceptual ambiguities arising from applying Newtonian intuition to relativistic settings, specifically addressing how angular momentum and black-hole rotation influence free-fall dynamics and gravitational collapse.

Method: Analyzes free-fall in Schwarzschild/Kerr spacetimes using an effective-potential heuristic and covariant 1+3 decomposition. Examines geodesic congruences' expansion/shear via Raychaudhuri equations.

Result: Identifies parameter regions where Kerr spacetime causes stronger/weaker infall than Schwarzschild. Shows black hole spin modifies shear, affecting gravitational focusing even when expansion decreases.

Conclusion: Angular momentum and rotation combine to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing through shear modulation, providing a unified energetic/geometric framework for understanding relativistic infall dynamics.

Abstract: We examine the role of angular momentum in general relativity from both heuristic and fully covariant perspectives, with the aim of clarifying conceptual ambiguities that arise when Newtonian intuition is extrapolated into the relativistic regime. Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.

### [60] [Polarized Radiative Transfer of Kerr-Newman Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14785)
*Xin Li,Guo Sen,Pei Wang,En-Wei Liang,Xiao-Xiong Zeng,Kai Lin*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores how the charge of a Kerr-Newman black hole affects photon polarization in imaging, using a new ODE framework that integrates photon paths and polarization transport without relying on symmetries. It finds that higher charge alters photon trajectories and creates distinct polarization patterns, offering a possible method to detect black hole charge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of black hole charge on photon propagation and polarization, overcoming limitations of existing methods that depend on specific symmetries like Killing tensors.

Method: Extended Walker-Penrose approach with a numerical ODE framework combining photon orbit and polarization parallel transport equations, allowing analysis in any spacetime without symmetry assumptions.

Result: Charge modifies photon trajectories and polarization patterns (EVPA structure compression, distortion, localized rotations, asymmetries) in accretion disk radiation, especially noticeable on photon-ring scales.

Conclusion: Black hole charge leaves detectable polarization signatures, providing a new diagnostic tool for measuring nonzero charge in observed black holes.

Abstract: In this analysis, we investigate the polarization radiation imaging of Kerr-Newman black holes, with a particular focus on the impact of black hole charge on photon propagation and polarization characteristics. By extending the traditional Walker-Penrose method, which is limited by its reliance on specific symmetric structures and Killing tensors, we overcome these limitations by constructing an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerical framework that combines the photon orbit equation with the polarization parallel transport equation. This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks. Our results show that black hole charge can significantly modify photon trajectories and polarization patterns: increasing charge compresses and distorts the EVPA structure on photon-ring scales, inducing localized rotations and asymmetries that may provide a potential diagnostic of a nonzero black hole charge.

### [61] [The relativistic restricted three-body problem: geometry and motion around tidally perturbed black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14979)
*Takuya Katagiri,Vitor Cardoso*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The study examines how tidal forces affect the geometry around rotating black holes and the orbits of objects nearby. It identifies four stages of orbital evolution as tidal strength increases, with transitions from regular to chaotic orbits, plunging, unbinding, and eventual loss of all bound orbits. The work also connects these effects to observations by gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO, LISA, and DECIGO, suggesting tidal influences alter orbital dynamics and gravitational-wave signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by astrophysical phenomena like disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals, the research aims to understand structural changes in the relativistic three-body problem near a tidally deformed black hole. The study seeks to explore tidal effects on geodesics as binaries evolve adiabatically.

Method: The method involves analyzing timelike geodesics around a tidally deformed, rotating black hole. Semi-analytic models are employed to estimate critical tidal amplitudes for each transition stage identified. Numerical or analytical solutions of geodesic equations under varying tidal deformations are likely central to the approach.

Result: Four distinct stages of geodesic behavior under increasing tidal forces are observed: emergence of weak chaos, orbit plunges into the black hole, unbinding of remaining trajectories, and complete disappearance of bound orbits. Critical tidal strengths for each transition are quantified. Detection implications for ground-based detectors (orbital depletion) and space-based observatories (earlier stages) are highlighted.

Conclusion: Tidal perturbations significantly influence orbital dynamics around massive black holes over wide separations, potentially affecting gravitational-wave phase accumulation. The nonlinear coupling of epicyclic oscillations could explain quasi-periodic X-ray oscillations in accreting black holes, suggesting tidal effects are observable through both gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals.

Abstract: We investigate the geometry of a tidally deformed, rotating black hole and timelike geodesics in its vicinity. Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.

TL;DR: This paper examines the observational effects of massive spin-2 fields (beyond the standard graviton) on gravitational wave propagation, deriving analytical transfer functions and establishing detectability limits for current/future detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive spin-2 fields are predicted in extensions like massive bigravity and extra-dimensional models, requiring observational tests. Their impact on gravitational wave propagation has not been fully explored phenomenologically.

Method: Developed a phenomenological framework consistent with theories containing massive spin-2 fields. Derived analytical transfer functions in the ultrarelativistic limit to model gravitational wave distortions caused by these fields.

Result: Established detectability bounds for massive spin-2 fields using gravitational wave observations. Provided parameter space forecasts for current (LIGO/Virgo) and future (LISA, Einstein Telescope) detectors.

Conclusion: Gravitational wave observations can constrain or detect massive spin-2 sectors. Future detector sensitivities may access currently unexplored parameter regions, offering new tests of beyond-GR gravity theories.

Abstract: Massive spin-2 fields in addition to the standard massless graviton arise naturally in extensions of General Relativity, such as massive bigravity or models with extra dimensions. This work explores the observational signatures of these fields on the propagation of gravitational waves. Adopting a phenomenological framework consistent with such theories, we derive an analytical transfer function in the ultrarelativistic limit and establish detectability bounds. Finally, we provide forecasts for the accessible parameter space using current and future gravitational wave detectors.

### [63] [Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15226)
*Patrick Hu,Robert J. Scherrer*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper derives exact general solutions for scalar field evolution in a universe dominated by a fluid with w_B = -1, extending previous work on w_B > -1. Solutions are found for specific potentials and compare the slow-roll approximation applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of scalar field dynamics in a universe with vacuum-like energy (w_B = -1) beyond existing attractor solutions, providing general solutions and exploring the validity of slow-roll approximations in such scenarios.

Method: The authors analytically solve the scalar field equations using linear and nonlinear differential equation techniques for various potentials (constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, φ^(1/2), and 1/φ). They generalize the slow-roll approximation analysis for w_B = -1 and compare it with w_B > -1 cases.

Result: Exact solutions exist for specific potentials, though they are complex and less practical than prior solutions for matter/radiation. The slow-roll approximation is valid for flat potentials under vacuum domination but irrelevant when w_B > -1.

Conclusion: Exact solutions for w_B = -1 are mathematically possible but less useful; the slow-roll method is a viable tool only for vacuum-dominated universes, highlighting differences in scalar field behavior between w_B = -1 and w_B > -1 regimes.

Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $φ$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B > -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln φ$, $V = V_0 φ^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/φ$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B > -1$.
