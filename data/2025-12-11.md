Abstract: I present a new indirect search for dark matter (DM) using Hydrogen-$α$ (H$α$) recombination emission. DM annihilation or decay products can ionize neutral gas; subsequent recombination cascades generate H$α$ photons through the $3\rightarrow2$ transition. In quiet gas-rich dwarf galaxies, the $n{=}2$ population is negligible, so H$α$ is effectively unabsorbed and traces the DM-energy injection site. Using the non-detection of extended H$α$ emission in the Leo T dwarf galaxy with Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations, I derive the first H$α$-based limits on DM annihilation and decay, reaching leading sensitivity for parts of the eV-GeV mass range. Existing and upcoming telescopes can further extend this reach, establishing H$α$ imaging as a powerful DM search strategy.

### [2] [Testing lepton non-unitarity with the next generation of (Germanium-based) CE$ν$NS reactor experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09027)
*Salvador Centelles Chuliá,Manfred Lindner,Thomas Rink*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how future coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) experiments can detect deviations from the Standard Model by studying unitarity violations in the neutrino mixing matrix, considering both heavy sterile neutrino (seesaw limit) and light sterile neutrino scenarios, with projections for reactor experiments to probe TeV-scale new physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage precision CEνNS measurements to test lepton mixing unitarity and search for physics beyond the Standard Model, potentially involving sterile neutrinos. The motivation arises from the experimental confirmation of CEνNS and the need to explore new physics avenues.

Method: The study analyzes two scenarios—seesaw limit (heavy sterile neutrinos causing effective unitarity violation) and light sterile limit (neutrinos participating in interactions). It models their effects on CEνNS and EνeS, then projects sensitivity for a scaled-up reactor experiment based on CONUS+. Systematic uncertainties are analyzed to assess feasibility.

Result: The proposed upscale reactor experiment could probe TeV-scale new physics via unitarity violation. The analysis shows distinct phenomenological signals between the two scenarios, demonstrating CEνNS's potential to constrain or discover sterile neutrinos and test lepton sector physics.

Conclusion: Future precision CEνNS experiments, particularly those scaled from CONUS+, offer a robust platform to investigate lepton mixing deviations and probe beyond-Standard-Model physics, with clear paths to testing TeV-scale new physics models involving sterile neutrinos.

Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$ν$NS) has been experimentally confirmed using neutrinos from pion decay at rest, solar neutrinos and reactor antineutrinos. Future CE$ν$NS experiments will foreseeable lead to precision measurements which will be a powerful tool to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate possible deviations from unitarity in the $3\times3$ leptonic mixing matrix that controls the propagation of active neutrinos. Such deviations may originate from the mixing with additional gauge singlet fermions and depending on their mass scale and mixing, the resulting phenomenology can differ substantially. We explore two well-motivated regimes: the \textit{seesaw limit}, where the new fermions are heavy and kinematically inaccessible, leading to effective deviations from unitarity in the active sector; and the \textit{light sterile limit}, where they are light enough to be produced and participate in neutrino propagation and scattering processes. We show how these scenarios modify both CE$ν$NS and elastic neutrino--electron scattering (E$νe$S), and we present the corresponding sensitivity projections for a future CE$ν$NS reactor experiment obtained by upscaling the CONUS+ experiment, which reported the first observation of reactor CE$ν$NS. We identify the leading experimental systematics relevant for such an upscaling and demonstrate the resulting capability to probe TeV-scale new physics. Our results highlight the strong potential of CE$ν$NS to test the structure of the lepton sector and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We provide a precise, model- and parametrization-independent dispersive determination of the $f_0(500)$, $ρ(770)$, $f_0(980)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_0(1370)$, $ρ(1450)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $ρ_3(1690)$ resonance pole parameters. They are obtained from the analytic continuation, by means of continued fractions, of forward dispersion relations, whose input is a recent global dispersive analysis of $ππ$ scattering data. From this dispersive study, we find no indications of other resonant poles below 1.7 GeV. Beyond this energy, we also provide resonance pole parameters from the direct analytic continuation of Global Fits to the three existing incompatible data sets. Depending on the data set we find poles for the $ρ(1700)$, $f_0(1710)$, $ρ(1900)$, $f_2(1950)$, and $f_0(2020)$ resonances. We also present the Argand diagrams of these Global Fits and illustrate that each resonance does not necessarily have to trace a full circle in the diagram.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We explore the signals of a scenario in which the composite states of a strongly coupled hidden sector couple to the Standard Model through the neutrino portal, giving rise to the neutrino masses. We consider a framework in which the hidden sector is conformal in the ultraviolet and the compositeness scale lies below the weak scale. If the lightest composite state in the hidden sector is a scalar, its decay rate back to the Standard Model is suppressed by angular momentum considerations and can naturally be small, giving rise to long-lived particle signals. We determine the current constraints on this class of models and explore the reach of future collider and beam dump searches. We find that FASER, SHiP, and Belle II can potentially probe a significant part of the unexplored parameter space.

### [5] [A novel two loop inverse seesaw model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09063)
*Gonzalo Benítez-Irarrázabal,Rocío Branada Balbontín,Cesar Bonilla,A. E. Cárcamo Hernández,Sergey Kovalenko,Juan Marchant González*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an extended Standard Model with a two-loop inverse seesaw mechanism to generate tiny neutrino masses via TeV-scale mediators. It introduces two real singlet scalars and four neutral leptons under U(1) and Z₃ symmetries, predicting testable signals in flavor experiments and colliders, while providing a stable Z₃-invariant dark matter candidate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the smallness of neutrino masses, the need for TeV-scale physics with testable signatures, and the requirement of a stable dark matter candidate without conflicting with observational data.

Method: The model incorporates two real singlet scalars and four neutral leptons, supported by a U(1) and a residual Z₃ symmetry. The Z₃ symmetry suppresses tree-level and one-loop neutrino masses and stabilizes DM. Parameter space is analyzed for relic abundance consistency with observed DM density.

Result: Predicts neutrino masses in the 2.1-4.4 meV range (normal ordering), BR(μ→eγ) ~1.6×10⁻¹⁴, and viable DM candidates (scalar ρ or fermion Ω) compatible with relic density. Collider and flavor experiments like MEG II/LHC can test the model.

Conclusion: The model unifies neutrino mass generation with dark matter stability and flavor observables, offering distinct predictions from inverse/radiative seesaw models. Next-gen experiments can validate key predictions, linking low-energy and high-energy physics.

Abstract: We propose a Standard Model (SM) extension where neutrinos get masses through a two-loop inverse seesaw mechanism. This naturally explains the smallness of the neutrino masses and allows seesaw mediators to be at the TeV scale with testable phenomenology. The model adds two real singlet scalars and four electrically neutral leptons to the SM. The extension considers the existence of two global Abelian symmetries, a continuous $U(1)$ and a discrete $Z_3$. The latter, remains unbroken after spontaneous symmetry breaking and forbids tree-level and one-loop neutrino masses, and stabilizes the dark matter (DM) candidates. This setup accommodates neutrino-oscillation data, yields two pseudo-Dirac heavy pairs with small active-sterile mixing, and predicts an effective Majorana mass $m_{ee}$ in the $2.1$-$4.4$ meV range for normal ordering. Charged-lepton flavor violation is naturally suppressed yet testable: for a representative benchmark we obtain BR$(μ\to e γ)\simeq 1.6 \times 10^{-14}$, with correlated signals in $μ\to eee$ and $μ$-$e$ conversion within next-generation experimental reach. Altogether, the radiative origin of neutrino masses links low-energy flavor observables to collider signatures, delineating discovery targets for MEG II, Mu2e/COMET, and the HL-LHC and distinguishing this framework from conventional inverse- and radiative-seesaw models. Moreover, the $Z_3$ guarantees a stable DM candidate, either scalar ($ρ$) or fermionic ($Ω$). Then, here we analyze and identify the viable parameter space that is consistent with the observed DM relic abundance for both situations.

Motivation: To guide model selection among BSM frameworks by evaluating their relic density predictions against observational data.

Method: Relic density calculations across mass ranges in low coupling regimes of IDM, MSSM, and NMSSM using MicrOMEGAs software.

Result: Key behavioral differences in models' relic densities were identified, pinpointing mass regions compliant with current observational bounds.

Conclusion: The analysis aids in distinguishing viable BSM models based on their relic density constraints and compatibility with observations.

Abstract: This article presents a computational comparison of relic density predictions for three prominent frameworks Beyond the Standard Model (BSM): the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), the Minimal SuperSymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), and the Next-to-Minimal SuperSymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). Using MicrOMEGAs, we calculate relic densities over varying mass ranges in the low coupling regime. We highlight key differences in each model's behavior relative to current observational bounds and identify viable mass regions. The findings contribute towards guiding model selection based on relic density constraints and suitability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we consider hilltop inflation where the inflaton is coupled to a curvaton, simultaneously addressing two main challenges faced by conventional hilltop inflation models: the initial-value problem; and their viability for sub-Planckian field values. In standard single-field hilltop inflation, the inflaton must start extremely close to the maximum of the potential, raising concerns about the naturalness of the initial conditions. We demonstrate that the curvaton field not only solves the initial-value problem, but also opens up parameter space through modifying the curvature perturbation power spectrum, reviving the cubic and quartic hilltop inflation models in the sub-Planckian regime. We find viable parameter space consistent with the recent cosmological observations, and predict a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio that can be tested in the next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments.

Abstract: This study calculates the system energies of families of pentaquarks, $uudc\bar{c}$, starting from 5 quarks up to 70 using Thomas-Fermi statistical quark model. The model assumes spherical symmetry with the particles continuously distributed with varying densities and boundaries. The particles interact with Coulombic forces and a discontinuity in the light quark density function is energetically favored. Total energies of the system are calculated for each multiquark system and compared to determine family stability characteristics. A remarkable stability for multiquark combinations with multiples of four pentaquarks, which we term an icosaquark, is identified. The first icosaquark system is found to have lowest energy per quark, suggesting stability of a system consisting of four charm, four anticharm and twelve light quarks.

### [9] [Unfolding quantum entanglement from $h\to ZZ^*\to jj\ell\ell$ at a muon collider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09121)
*Songshaptak De,Atri Dey,Tousik Samui*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of Bell-type inequalities to study quantum entanglement in Higgs boson decays at a muon collider, achieving strong entanglement measurements with minimal uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of studying quantum entanglement through Bell-type inequalities in Higgs boson decays, leveraging muon collider environments to access higher energies and larger datasets.

Method: Analyzing the $μ^+ μ^- 	o νarν h 	o νarν ZZ^*$ process, using CGLMP inequality with optimal Bell operators for bipartite qutrit systems, and applying unfolding methods to correct for experimental effects. Different analysis techniques (BDT vs. cuts) were used across collider energies.

Result: Observed clear Bell inequality violations with $

\mathcal{I}_3$ values approaching the theoretical maximum (2.9149), demonstrating high entanglement with low uncertainties due to large hadronic mode event yields.

Conclusion: Muon colliders enable precise measurement of quantum entanglement in Higgs decays, showing strong Bell inequality violations and significant experimental potential for quantum correlations studies at high energies.

Abstract: We explore the potential to study quantum entanglement through Bell-type inequalities in Higgs boson decays at a future muon collider. Our analysis focuses on the channel $μ^+ μ^- \to ν\barν h \to ν\barν ZZ^*$, with one $Z$ decaying to charged leptons and the other decaying hadronically into jets. We study the violation of the CGLMP inequality using the optimal Bell operator for the bipartite qutrit system from $h \to ZZ^*$. The entanglement measure $\mathcal{I}_3$ is constructed from spin-correlated angular observables of the $Z$ decay products. An unfolding method on the angular variables is applied to correct for hadronization and detector effects, recovering the advantage of the hadronic mode with higher event yield and reduced uncertainty. The study is performed at 1, 3, and 10 TeV centre-of-mass energies, assuming 10 ab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity for each case. At 1 TeV, we use a boosted decision tree for signal isolation, while at higher energies, simple cut-based analyses are sufficient. We find clear Bell inequality violation with the expected values $\mathcal{I}_3 = 2.625 \pm 0.012$, $2.623 \pm 0.004$, and $2.582 \pm 0.010$ for the 1, 3, and 10 TeV machines, respectively. Overall, a strong level of entanglement close to the maximum achievable value of 2.9149 for a two-qutrit system can be measured with very small uncertainties due to the large event yield in the hadronic mode.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using continuum Schwinger function methods to study baryon resonances, emphasizing resonance electroproduction and transition form factors to uncover their structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand not just the nucleon but all baryon resonances as fundamental three-body systems, leveraging electroproduction data for insight into their structure.

Method: Application of continuum Schwinger function methods focused on resonance electroproduction to analyze transition form factors extracted from experimental data.

Result: Highlights the value of transition form factors in revealing resonance structure, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Continuum Schwinger function methods offer a promising approach for baryon resonance studies, with resonance electroproduction providing key data for structural analysis.

Abstract: The first baryon resonance was discovered in the early 1950s. The Roper resonance joined the collection ten years later. Today, many baryon resonances are known and more are being discovered. As baryons, these states are the must fundamental three-body systems in Nature. They must all be understood, not just the isolated ground state nucleon. This contribution sketches applications of continuum Schwinger function methods to the baryon resonance problem. Whilst spectroscopy is of value, particular emphasis is placed on resonance electroproduction because transition form factors extracted from electroproduction data provide a keen tool for revealing resonance structure.

Abstract: In an electron-positron plasma, an imbalance in the number of right- and left-chiral particles can lead to the growth of a helical magnetic field through a phenomenon called the chiral plasma instability (CPI). In the early universe, scattering reactions that violate chirality come into thermal equilibrium when the plasma cools below a temperature of approximately $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. Since these reactions tend to relax any pre-existing chiral asymmetry to zero as the system approaches equilibrium, the standard lore is that primordial magnetogenesis via the CPI is not viable below $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. In this work, we propose that the presence of a source for chirality can allow the CPI to operate even below $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, we explore the implications of this scenario, and we derive predictions for the resultant magnetic field helicity using a combination of analytical methods and direct numerical simulation.

### [12] [Finite $V_{\rm 2Δ}$ puzzle in low-multiplicity pp collisions from ultra-long-range azimuthal correlations in the string-shoving model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09195)
*Antonio Ortiz,Dushmanta Sahu,Gyula Bencedi*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The study investigates how event-activity estimators affect ultra-long range angular correlations in pp collisions using PYTHIA8 simulations with string shoving. It finds that correlations are most sensitive in single-parton scatterings (N_mpi=1) and that string shoving explains low-multiplicity data, while hydrodynamics may dominate at high multiplicities. Flattenicity shows promise over N_ch for reducing non-flow effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of different event-activity measures on ultra-long range correlations observed in ALICE pp data, and evaluate the role of string shoving versus hydrodynamic mechanisms across multiplicity ranges.

Method: Simulations with PYTHIA8 including string shoving, analyzing correlations as functions of N_ch, parton scatterings (N_mpi), and flattenicity. Compared predictions to ALICE data focusing on V2Δ behavior.

Result: Ultra-long range correlations are most pronounced in N_mpi=1 events. String shoving predicts V2Δ decreases with N_ch, matching low-multiplicity data, but diverges at higher multiplicities. Flattenicity better suppresses non-flow effects than N_ch.

Conclusion: String shoving explains low-multiplicity correlation patterns, while high-multiplicity dynamics likely involve hydro effects. Flattenicity is a superior variable for isolating flow signals in pp collisions.

Abstract: Ultra-long range angular correlations have been recently reported by the ALICE collaboration in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV below ${\rm d}N_{\rm ch}/{\rm d}η=7$. The measurements have been performed as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity at midrapidity ($N_{\rm ch}$ in $|η|<0.8$), which is known to be strongly sensitive to local multiplicity fluctuations. The present work investigates the impact of the event-activity estimator on ultra-long range angular correlations. The study is conducted in the framework of PYTHIA8 with the string shoving mechanism since it gives a non-zero elliptic flow coefficient, $V_{2Δ}$. The analysis is conducted as a function of $N_{\rm ch}$, the number of parton-parton scatterings ($N_{\rm mpi}$) and flattenicity. Surprisingly, for ultra-long range correlations, pp collisions with $N_{\rm mpi}=1$ (dijets) seems to be the most sensitive to string shoving. The effect diminishes with increasing $N_{\rm mpi}$. While in data, within uncertainties, $V_{2Δ}$ exhibits a weak multiplicity dependence; the string shoving mechanism gives a $V_{2Δ}$ that decreases with the increase in $N_{\rm ch}$. The present work therefore supports the picture stating that mechanisms such as string shoving might explain the low multiplicity limit, whereas, hydro becomes relevant in high-multiplicity pp collisions. This work also suggests that flattenicity might be more effective than $N_{\rm ch}$ to better handle non-flow effects.

### [13] [Nucleon decays into three leptons: contact contributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09287)
*Yi Liao,Xiao-Dong Ma,Xiang Zhao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines baryon number violating nucleon decays into three leptons via dimension-9 operators, providing new constraints and model analysis for future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore non-conventional baryon number violation modes beyond standard two-body decays and address limitations of previously studied dimension-6 operators which are heavily constrained.

Method: Constructs a complete dimension-9 LEFT operator basis, matches them to chiral perturbation theory, calculates decay widths using experimental data, and analyzes an ultraviolet-complete model.

Result: Derived stringent constraints on dimension-9 operators and demonstrated model connections, enabling future experimental studies in large neutrino detectors.

Conclusion: Dimension-9 operators offer viable pathways for observing exotic nucleon decays, emphasizing their importance for next-generation neutrino experiments.

Abstract: Baryon number violating (BNV) nucleon decays into three leptons provide a unique probe of BNV interactions beyond the conventional two-body modes involving a single lepton and a light meson. In a previous work [Nucleon decays into three leptons: noncontact contributions, arXiv:2512.02692.], two of us analyzed the noncontact contributions to these decays arising from dimension-6 (dim-6) operators within the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT), and found that they are severely suppressed due to stringent constraints on these dim-6 operators. In this work, we continue this endeavor by systematically investigating the contact contributions originating from dim-9 LEFT operators. We construct a complete basis of dim-9 operators relevant to these processes, and subsequently match them onto chiral perturbation theory to calculate their decay widths. By employing existing experimental data, we derive stringent constraints on the relevant operators. In addition, we present the analysis of an ultraviolet-complete model to demonstrate its connection with our theoretical framework, thereby facilitating further studies of these exotic nucleon decays in upcoming neutrino experiments with large fiducial masses.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Three-Higgs Doublet Model integrating dark matter and dark energy as specific scalars under symmetry constraints, ensuring compatibility with observational data and radiative stability through RGE analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework accommodating both dark matter and dark energy within a single model while maintaining consistency with cosmological observations and theoretical requirements.

Method: Implementing $Z_2$ symmetry for dark matter stability and shift symmetry for dark energy mimicry; calculating relic density via micrOMEGAs and analyzing RGEs with SARAH at one- and two-loop levels.

Result: Dark matter relic density aligns with observational limits even with dark energy inclusion; radiative stability confirmed over wide energy ranges.

Conclusion: The model provides a foundation for studying dark matter-dark energy interactions in early universe contexts and exploring alternative cosmic dynamics.

Abstract: This article discusses the incorporation of dark matter and dark energy into a new physics model called the Three-Higgs Doublet Model. Dark matter and dark energy are accommodated as CP-even and $Z_2$-odd scalars in their respective inert doublets. By leveraging a $Z_2$ symmetry to suppress certain interactions, we model the behavior of dark matter. Similarly, by imposing a shift symmetry, dark energy can be mimicked within the same framework for the current cosmic epoch. The dark matter relic density is calculated for our model using \texttt{micrOMEGAs}. It is shown that despite the inclusion of dark energy, dark matter relic density can be brought within observational bounds and match existing literature. Furthermore, the one-loop and two-loop Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) were computed using \texttt{SARAH} to ensure radiative stability over a large range of energies. This study lays the groundwork for a future study of dark matter-dark energy interactions in the early universe and the exploration of different early universe dynamics.

*Li Ang,Dao-Neng Gao*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes rare Z-boson decays into heavy vector quarkonia and charged leptons, showing that electromagnetic fragmentation transitions dominate charmonium decays while other diagrams contribute to bottomonium branching fractions. It highlights the potential for future experiments to test the Standard Model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve theoretical predictions for rare Z-boson decays and explore their sensitivity to Standard Model tests and new physics extensions through detailed analysis of decay mechanisms and observables.

Method: Calculation of all relevant tree-level Feynman diagrams contributing to Z→Vℓ+ℓ− decays (V=J/ψ, ψ(2S), Υ(nS)), focusing on electromagnetic fragmentation transitions and differential angular distributions.

Result: For charmonium final states, fragmentation transitions dominate with negligible other contributions; bottomonium branching fractions increase by 4-9% when including additional diagrams. Angular distributions predict zero Standard Model forward-backward lepton asymmetry.

Conclusion: These decay processes offer a promising avenue for precise Standard Model verification and probing beyond-Standard-Model physics in high-statistics Z-boson experiments.

Abstract: We improve the theoretical predictions for rare $Z$-boson decays, $Z\to V\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e$ or $μ$), where $V$ denotes a heavy vector quarkonium including $J/Ψ$, $Ψ(2S)$, and $Υ(nS)$ with $n=1,2,3$. These processes are thought to be dominated by the electromagnetic fragmentation transition, i.e., $Z\to γ^*\ell^+\ell^-$ followed by $γ^*\rightarrow V$. The present study includes all of the relevant tree-level Feynman diagrams, which contribute to these decays in the standard model. Our analysis shows that, for the charmonium final states, the fragmentation transition almost saturates the whole contribution and the other diagrams can be neglected; while for the bottomonium final states, the inclusion of other diagrams can increase their branching fractions by $4\%\sim 9\%$. Further investigation of the differential distributions, especially the angular distributions, indicates that forward-backward asymmetries for final leptons in these processes would be zero in the standard model. Therefore, in future experimental facilities with large number of $Z$-boson events accumulated, studies of these rare $Z$ decays may help both to test the standard model and to probe its interesting extensions.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the dark atom model by examining the wave functions of a bound state particle with a -2n charge and helium-4, and calculates the abundance of anomalous isotopes formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis through a process analogous to proton-neutron capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the implications of the dark atom model on particle physics and cosmology, specifically understanding the formation and abundance of unusual isotopes like OBe nuclei through dark atom interactions during early universe nucleosynthesis.

Method: The authors calculate wave functions for a bound state between a dark particle (-2n charge) and ⁴He²⁺. They then analogize the capture process of helium nuclei by dark atoms to proton-neutron capture to compute reaction cross sections and resulting isotope concentrations.

Result: Determined the concentration of OBe nuclei formed via dark atom-helium capture during Big Bang nucleosynthesis, providing insights into dark matter's role in primordial isotope production.

Conclusion: The study suggests that dark atom interactions could significantly influence the abundance of anomalous isotopes in the early universe, offering a testable prediction for cosmological models involving dark atoms.

Abstract: In this work, we study some aspects of the dark atom model. We consider a finite-size nucleus to find the wave functions of the bound state of a stable particle with a charge of $-2n$ and helium-4 $^4He^{++}$. Then we address the problem of calculating the abundance of anomalous isotopes arising from the capture of helium nuclei by dark atoms during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We use an analogy with the proton-neutron capture process to calculate the reaction cross section and thus determine the concentration of OBe nuclei.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The process of $Ξ_{bc}^{+}\to Ξ_{c}^{+}J/ψ$ is among the most favored modes for searching for bottom-charm baryons. However, its branching fraction has never been studied in theory. In this work, we investigate the branching fraction of $Ξ_{bc}^{+}\to Ξ_{c}^{+}J/ψ$ in the final-state-interaction approach, as it is dominated by the color-suppressed non-factorizable contributions. A similar process, $Λ_{b}^{0}\to Λ^0 J/ψ$, is used as a control mode to fix the model parameter. Consequently, the branching fraction of $Ξ_{bc}^{+}\to Ξ_{c}^{+}J/ψ$ is predicted to be $(1.55_{-0.42}^{+0.50})\times10^{-4}$. With the production rate of bottom-charm baryons and the detection efficiencies of the final states, it is expected for considerable signal events to observe $Ξ_{bc}^+$ in the near future.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model where an axionlike particle (ALP) simultaneously explains the baryon asymmetry and dark matter via first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) dynamics, enabled by a temperature-dependent scalar field $S$ and a transient ALP mass enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve two cosmological puzzles—generation of baryon asymmetry and dark matter composition—through a unified framework involving the ALP and first-order EWPT with gravitational wave signatures.

Method: The model uses a scalar field $S$ to induce a first-order EWPT, temporarily altering the ALP potential via higher-dimensional operators. This triggers an ALP velocity boost, broadening parameter space for relic density and producing gravitational waves. ALP coupling to electroweak anomaly drives baryogenesis.

Result: The model predicts detectable stochastic gravitational-wave signals from the EWPT, while ALP dynamics achieve simultaneous baryogenesis and dark matter relics within viable cosmological parameters.

Conclusion: A single ALP framework can address baryon asymmetry, dark matter, and gravitational wave signals, offering a unified solution grounded in first-order electroweak phase transitions.

Abstract: We show that an axionlike particle (ALP) can simultaneously generate the baryon asymmetry and constitute dark matter through dynamics triggered by a first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT). In our proposal, the transition briefly reshapes the ALP potential via a temperature-dependent vacuum expectation value of a scalar field $S$, responsible for making the EWPT of first order, inducing a transient mass enhancement of ALP via higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operator(s). This sudden kick generates a large ALP velocity near the onset of EWPT enabling the broadening of relic satisfied parameter space and predict a complementary stochastic gravitational-wave signal from the underlying first-order transition. We further show that the same ALP dynamics can naturally fuel electroweak baryogenesis through its coupling to electroweak anomaly.

*Charles Earnshaw,Biljana Mitreska,Danny van Dyk*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the differential distribution of semileptonic decays focusing on the perpendicular momentum of the final state hadron, using LHCb data to extract |V_{cb}| and form factor information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential ofhadronic recoil momentum measurements in improving determinations of CKM matrix elements and form factors.

Method: Phenomenological analysis of LHCb's $ar{B}_s^0	o D_s^+μ^-arν$ decay data, binning the rate by the hadron's perpendicular momentum component.

Result: Extraction of |V_{cb}| and insights into the shape ofhadronic form factors from the measured momentum distributions.

Conclusion: The method offers a novel approach to constrain CKM elements and form factors but highlights challenges in experimental precision and theoretical modeling.

Abstract: We derive the differential distribution of semileptonic decays with respect to the perpendicular momentum component of the final state hadron. The benefits and shortfalls arising from measurements of these distributions are discussed. Our approach is illustrated on the LHCb measurement of the $\bar{B}_s^0\to D_s^+μ^-\barν$ decay distribution where the publicly available data by the LHCb experiment is used in an independent phenomenological analysis for the first time. We extract the CKM element $|V_{cb}|$ and information on the shape of the relevant hadronic form factors from the measurement of the binned rate in the perpendicular momentum component of the hadron.

### [20] [A Precise $α_s$ Determination from the R-improved QCD Static Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09888)
*Jose M. Mena-Valle*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a precise extraction of the strong coupling constant α_s using lattice-QCD data for the static energy, employing R-improvement of the three-loop fixed-order prediction, resummation of infrared and ultrasoft logarithms to high accuracy, and profile functions to extend perturbation theory's range. The final result α_s(m_Z)=0.1170±0.0009 aligns with the world average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine α_s with high precision and reduce theoretical uncertainties by improving perturbative calculations and incorporating advanced resummation techniques.

Method: Combining R-improvement for three-loop static energy, profile functions for radius-dependent scales, N^3LL ultrasoft logarithm resummation, and R-evolution with systematic uncertainty analysis through parameter scans.

Result: The extracted α_s(m_Z)=0.1170±0.0009 matches world averages, showing reliability of the method and controlling uncertainties from fit ranges, resummation, and procedure choices.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances precision in α_s determination, validating the use of advanced perturbative improvements and systematic uncertainty quantification in lattice-QCD analyses.

Abstract: The strong coupling $α_s$ is extracted with high precision through fits to lattice-QCD data for the static energy. Our theoretical framework is based on R-improving the three-loop fixed-order prediction for the static energy: we remove the $u=1/2$ renormalon and resum the associated large infrared logarithms. Combined with radius-dependent renormalization scales (the so-called profile functions), this procedure extends the range of validity of perturbation theory to distances as large as $\sim 0.5\,$fm. In addition, we resum large ultrasoft logarithms to N$^3$LL accuracy using renormalization-group evolution. Since the standard four-loop R-evolution treats N$^4$LL and higher-order contributions asymmetrically, we also incorporate this potential source of bias in our analysis. Our estimate of the perturbative uncertainty is obtained through a random scan over the parameters controlling the profile functions and the implementation of R-evolution. We analyze how the extracted value of $α_s$ depends on the shortest and longest distances included in the fit, on the details of the R-evolution procedure, on the fitting strategy itself, and on the accuracy of ultrasoft resummation. From our final analysis, and after evolution to the $Z$ pole, we obtain $α^{(n_f=5)}_s(m_Z)=0.1170\pm 0.0009$, a result fully compatible with the world average and with a comparable uncertainty.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the photon emission by charged spinless particles with phase vortices and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection in longitudinal electric and magnetic fields within the scalar QED. A realistic wave packet of an electron or ion accelerated by a radio-frequency wave locally feels a constant and spatially homogeneous field, which allows us to develop an effective model for losing the angular momentum of the vortex particle due to photon emission. For the fields typical for accelerator facilities, we find that an effective lifetime of the vortex state greatly exceeds the acceleration time. This proves that the acceleration of vortex electrons, ions, muons, and so forth to relativistic energies is possible in conventional linacs, as well as in the wake-field accelerators with higher field gradients, the OAM losses due to the photon emission are mostly negligible, and that the vortex quantum state is highly robust against these losses.

### [22] [Computing the Electronic Gain for Detectors Read Out Up-The-Ramp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09131)
*Timothy D. Brandt*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a likelihood-based method to accurately determine electronic gain in astronomical images using nondestructive reads. It addresses nonlinearities and validates the method's consistency and bias, applying it to the Roman Space Telescope's Wide-Field Instrument to explain pixel response variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic gain is crucial for unit conversion and noise analysis in astronomical imaging, but traditional methods may be biased or inconsistent. The paper aims to provide a reliable estimator by leveraging nondestructive readout capabilities and accounting for detector nonlinearities.

Method: A likelihood-based approach models photon and Gaussian read noise using multiple nondestructive reads. The method extends to fit for slight nonlinearities between photoelectrons and measured counts, ensuring asymptotic correctness and minimal bias.

Result: The method yields consistent and nearly unbiased gain estimates with and without nonlinearity corrections. Application to the Roman Space Telescope's detector reveals that pixel-to-pixel gain variations explain most observed flatfield response inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The new method improves gain determination accuracy, critical for future space telescopes like Roman. The findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonlinearities and gain variations in detector calibration, with code provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: The electronic gain -- the conversion between photoelectrons on a pixel and the digital number recorded to disk -- gives physical units to an astronomical image and sets the relation between pixel value and photon noise. This paper presents a new, likelihood-based approach to derive the gain from images taken up-the-ramp, where the detector is read out nondestructively many times before being reset. Our method makes full use of the individual reads assuming an ideal detector subject to photon noise and Gaussian read noise. We extend the method to account for slight nonlinearities in the relation between photoelectrons and measured counts. We demonstrate that our likelihood-based approach provides a consistent (i.e. asymptotically correct) and nearly unbiased estimator of the gain both with and without fitting for nonlinearity. Finally, we apply this approach to a single detector from the Wide-Field Instrument on the Roman Space Telescope, and show how pixel-to-pixel gain variations describe much of the variations in pixel response seen in flatfield images. Code to compute gain and regenerate figures in this paper is available at https://github.com/RomanSpaceTelescope/SOCReferenceFileCode.

### [23] [A Classic Nonlinearity Correction Algorithm for Detectors Read Out Up-The-Ramp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09132)
*Timothy D. Brandt*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents an algorithm for nonlinearity correction in imaging detectors, addressing both read and photon noise. It efficiently processes multiple nondestructive ramps at various illumination levels, determining the optimal polynomial degree for correction via chi-squared analysis. Applied to Roman Space Telescope data, it shows a 9th-order polynomial suffices, with software provided for implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate and computationally efficient method for correcting nonlinearity in detectors under various illumination conditions, while quantifying uncertainties through chi-squared metrics to avoid overfitting. Also, to mitigate biases when combining ramps of differing illuminations.

Method: The algorithm simultaneously processes multiple nondestructive ramps across different count rates, directly computing the linearization function. It uses chi-squared统计 to determine optimal polynomial degree. Mitigates bias by ensuring consistent illumination ranges. Implemented in Python with linear computational complexity (~100 hours on a 2023 Macbook Pro for 4096x4096 pixels).

Result: For the Roman Space Telescope's Wide Field Instrument, a 9th-order polynomial achieved near-theoretical chi-squared minimum, with little improvement beyond this order. The method handles large datasets efficiently, validated on Hawaii-4 RG detector data.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides an efficient, bias-mitigated approach for nonlinearity correction with clear statistical validation. The publicly available implementation supports its adoption in天文仪器校准，如Roman太空望远镜.

Abstract: We derive an algorithm for computing a classic nonlinearity correction -- applicable to constant and uniform illumination -- in the presence of read noise and photon noise. The algorithm operates simultaneously on many nondestructive ramps at a range of count rates and directly computes the function transforming measured counts into linearized counts. We also compute chi squared for the corrected ramps, enabling the user to identify the polynomial degree beyond which chi squared ceases to improve significantly. The computational cost of our algorithm is linear in the number of reads and ramps, reaching ~100 hours to derive a correction for all 4096 x 4096 pixels of a Hawaii-4 RG detector from 186 illuminated 55-read ramps on a 2023 Macbook Pro laptop (~10,000 reads per pixel). We identify a potential source of bias in the nonlinearity correction when combining ramps of very different illuminations, together with effective mitigations. We apply our algorithm to a random set of pixels from the Roman Space Telescope's Wide Field Instrument. We find that a >=9th order nonlinearity correction is needed, at which point chi squared is close to its theoretically expected value and beyond which chi squared improves little with increasing polynomial order. Python software implementing our algorithm is available at https://github.com/RomanSpaceTelescope/SOCReferenceFileCode.

### [24] [CWTHF: Subhalo Identification with Continuous Wavelet Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09359)
*Minxing Li,Yun Wang,Ping He*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper extends the CWTHF halo finder to identify subhalos by incorporating an unbinding procedure, validated against SUBFIND using TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, achieving linear computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a computationally efficient and reliable subhalo detection method in high-resolution cosmological simulations, extending previous work on the CWT-based halo finder.

Method: Adapt the CWTHF algorithm to identify subhalos via density peak detection, unbinding procedure to ensure gravitational binding, and iterative registration to avoid duplicates, all within the CWT framework.

Result: Validation against SUBFIND shows reliable subhalo identification with maintained linear time complexity O(N).

Conclusion: The extended CWT method provides an efficient and robust alternative for subhalo detection in cosmological simulations, retaining computational advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: With advances in cosmology and computer science, cosmological simulations now resolve structures in increasingly fine detail. As key tracers of hierarchical structure formation, subhalos are among the most important objects within these simulations. In our previous work, we established that the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) can effectively extract clustering information and serve as a robust halo finder. Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog. Because the method inherits the original computational framework, our subhalo finder maintains a favorable linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective method for detecting gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae and other transient events, building on previous Frequency Hough Transform techniques.

Method: Enhanced GFH-v2 algorithm with optimized parameter selection, tested against simulated signals injected into real gravitational wave detector data (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a).

Result: The GFH-v2 method demonstrated improved theoretical and empirical sensitivity, along with better computational performance compared to its predecessors.

Conclusion: The improved framework provides a solid foundation for future searches of long-duration gravitational wave signals in upcoming观测 runs.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced methodology for searching long transient gravitational waves associated with a newborn magnetar using a strongly improved version of the generalized Frequency Hough Transform algorithm, called GFH-v2. We describe the main developments introduced relative to the original implementation and outline the optimized parameter-space selection used in the search. We then compute the theoretical sensitivity of the method and compare it with an empirical sensitivity estimate obtained by injecting simulated signals into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a data. The updated framework achieves improved sensitivity and computational performance. These results provide a robust basis for future directed searches for long-transient gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae and other transient events in current and upcoming observing runs.

Abstract: We investigate the presence and spatial characteristics of the jet base emission in M87* at 230 GHz, enabled by the enhanced uv coverage in the 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The addition of the 12-m Kitt Peak Telescope and NOEMA provides two key intermediate-length baselines to SMT and the IRAM 30-m, giving sensitivity to emission structures at scales of $\sim250~μ$as and $\sim2500~μ$as (0.02 pc and 0.2 pc). Without these baselines, earlier EHT observations lacked the capability to constrain emission on large scales, where a "missing flux" of order $\sim1$ Jy is expected. To probe these scales, we analyzed closure phases, robust against station-based gain errors, and modeled the jet base emission using a simple Gaussian offset from the compact ring emission at separations $>100~μ$as. Our analysis reveals a Gaussian feature centered at ($Δ$RA $\approx320~μ$as, $Δ$Dec $\approx60~μ$as), a projected separation of $\approx5500$ AU, with a flux density of only $\sim60$ mJy, implying that most of the missing flux in previous studies must arise from larger scales. Brighter emission at these scales is ruled out, and the data do not favor more complex models. This component aligns with the inferred direction of the large-scale jet and is consistent with emission from the jet base. While our findings indicate detectable jet base emission at 230 GHz, coverage from only two intermediate baselines limits reconstruction of its morphology. We therefore treat the recovered Gaussian as an upper limit on the jet base flux density. Future EHT observations with expanded intermediate-baseline coverage will be essential to constrain the structure and nature of this component.

### [27] [Viscously Spreading Accretion Disks around Black Holes: Implications for TDEs, LFBOTs and other Transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09017)
*Mila Winter-Granic,Eliot Quataert*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents a time-dependent model for accretion disks around black holes, explaining late-time plateaus in TDEs and LFBOTs like AT2018cow through factors like angular momentum redistribution and irradiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the late-time emission in TDEs and LFBOTs, addressing gaps in previous models that couldn't explain plateau luminosities without invoking viscous spreading or assuming unrealistic disk stability.

Method: A generalized viscous disk model incorporating outflows during super-Eddington accretion, non-conserved mass/angular momentum in TDE circularization, irradiation effects, and magnetically dominated thermodynamics.

Result: Angular momentum redistribution during TDE circularization explains plateaus without requiring viscous spreading. Irradiation significantly increases luminosity and duration. AT2018cow's optical/UV emission matches the model with BH masses 10-100M☉, while X-ray weakness suggests ongoing absorption.

Conclusion: Late-time TDE observations constrain disk physics (formation, transport, warps). Future HST/JWST observations could validate predicted SED breaks and disk thermodynamics in AT2018cow.

Abstract: We present a simple time-dependent model of viscously spreading accretion disks around black holes (BHs) with masses between $10-10^8M_\odot$. We apply the results to observations of late-time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOT) such as AT2018cow. Our model generalizes previous work by incorporating outflows during super-Eddington accretion, non-conservation of mass and angular momentum in TDE circularization, irradiation of the outer disk by the inner accretion flow, and a range of viscous stress models. We show that many late-time plateaus in TDEs can be explained by disks formed with a large spread in angular momentum due to redistribution during circularization. Viscous spreading on year timescales is not required, although it is also compatible with the data. The collapse of radiation pressure dominated thin disks to the stable gas-pressure dominated phase greatly underpredicts TDE plateau luminosities, strongly favoring thermally stable magnetically dominated disk models. Irradiation of the outer disk in TDEs due to misalignment of the stellar orbit and black hole spin increases plateau luminosities and durations by factors of a few. Continued study of late-time TDE emission provides a unique opportunity to constrain the physics of disk formation and circularization, disk warps, angular momentum transport, and other poorly understood aspects of disk physics. The models we develop can also explain the late-time optical-UV emission in the LFBOT AT2018cow for BH masses of ~$10-100M_\odot$. The faint X-ray emission at late times in AT2018cow is likely due to ongoing absorption. Our models predict that late-time X-rays should eventually be detectable again, and that HST/JWST observations of AT2018cow may detect a break in the SED at near-IR-optical wavelengths, providing a powerful probe of outer accretion disk thermodynamics.

*Vanessa López-Barquero,Alejandro Jenkins,Christopher S. Reynolds,Andrew Fabian*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new non-equilibrium thermodynamics framework to explain X-ray variability in accreting black holes through a 'pair thermostat' mechanism, linking coronal oscillations to heat engine principles similar to stellar pulsations. This mechanism may account for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and power turbulence/jets without external resonance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complex nonlinear dynamics behind observed X-ray variations and QPOs in black hole systems, offering an alternative to external resonant driving models.

Method: Develops a theoretical model where coronal plasma oscillations and inverse Compton cooling interact via feedback, creating a self-sustained oscillator analogous to the κ-mechanism in pulsating stars.

Result: Shows the coronal self-oscillation can explain QPOs and provide energy for turbulence/jets through cyclic energy extraction from thermal disequilibrium.

Conclusion: The proposed thermodynamic framework offers a unified explanation for coronal variability and energy dynamics, eliminating the need for external resonant drivers in black hole accretion systems.

Abstract: The variability of X-rays observed from accreting black hole systems, including quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), suggests a complex nonlinear dynamics in the corona. Here, we propose a new theoretical framework for this problem, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this model, coronal variability arises from feedback between a macroscopic oscillation of the plasma and the rate at which it is cooled by the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from the disc. The "pair thermostat'' mechanism then allows the corona to act as a heat engine that extracts work cyclically from the underlying thermal disequilibrium between the low-entropy heating and the high-entropy cooling by the soft photons, in close analogy to the well-known $κ$-mechanism for pulsating stars. This coronal self-oscillation may explain QPOs without the need to invoke an external resonant driving. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism can provide the power to generate turbulence and jets in the corona.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the host galaxy of GRB 2307A and its possible kilonova origin from a BNS merger, finding that a disk origin is possible but requires fine-tuned conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the origin of the large offset between the kilonova candidate and its host galaxy by evaluating globular cluster formation vs. disk formation with natal kicks.

Method: Used JWST and MUSE data to analyze host galaxy properties, applied Bayesian inference with NFW halo model, and compared with BNS merger simulations from SEVN/PARSEC.

Result: Globular cluster origin ruled out. Disk origin possible but only 0.1% of simulated systems match the observed offset within 2σ uncertainty.

Conclusion: The kilonova likely originated from a BNS formed in the disk with specific natal kick conditions, though such an event is statistically rare.

Abstract: We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$σ$ region of the galaxy mass model. This indicates that a disk origin is possible, but requires fine-tuned conditions for the kilonova to occur at such a large distance from the host galaxy.

Abstract: An important diagnostic of the inner structure of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes are the stochastic flux variations at X-ray wavelengths. Despite its significance, a systematic characterisation of the statistical properties of the X-ray variability to the highest Eddington ratios and most massive black holes is still lacking. In this paper we address this issue using SRG/eROSITA 5-epoch light curves to characterise the mean X-ray variability of optically selected SDSS QSOs extending to black holes masses of $10^{10}$ solar and accretion rates close to the Eddington limit. The adopted variability statistic is the ensemble normalised excess variance, which is measured using a novel hierarchical Bayesian model (eBExVar) tailored to the Poisson nature of the X-ray light curves. We find a clear anti-correlation of the ensemble variability with black hole mass, extending previous results to time scales of months. This can be interpreted as evidence for an X-ray corona size and/or physical conditions that scale with black holes mass. We also find an unexpected increase of the ensemble normalised excess variance close to the Eddington limit, which is contrary to the predictions of empirical variability models. This result suggests an additional variability component for fast growing black holes that may be related to systematic variations of the hot corona size with Eddington ratio or shielding of the hot corona by an inner puffed-up disk and/or outflows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel technique for creating high-fidelity pulsar timing templates using polarimetric data, resulting in 20-30% improved timing precision and providing new polarimetric measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance pulsar timing accuracy for applications like fundamental physics tests and gravitational wave detection, by addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Developed a framework that utilizes all polarimetric information (Stokes parameters) to model frequency-dependent pulse-shape evolution, applied to Parkes Pulsar Timing Array data.

Result: Achieved timing uncertainties reduced by up to 20-30%, and provided first phase- and frequency-resolved polarimetric measurements for observed millisecond pulsars.

Conclusion: The new method significantly improves timing precision and opens avenues for advanced pulsar studies; data, plots, and code are publicly shared to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Pulsar timing is used for a variety of applications including tests of fundamental physics, probing the structure of neutron stars, and detecting nanohertz gravitational waves. Development of robust methods and generation of high-quality timing data is therefore of utmost importance. In this paper, we present a new technique for creating high-fidelity templates that can be used to measure the pulse times of arrival with significantly increased precision compared to existing methods. Our framework makes use of all available polarimetric information to generate frequency-dependent models of pulse-shape evolution of all four Stokes parameters. We apply this method to millisecond pulsars observed by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and show that it results in timing measurement uncertainties reduced up to $\sim$20-30\%. We also present, for the first time, phase- and frequency-resolved polarimetric measurements of millisecond pulsars observed with the Parkes Murriyang ultra-widebandwith-low receiver. The data, plots and the code underlying this analysis are made publicly available.

*Andrew Mummery,Brian Metzger,Sjoert van Velzen,Muryel Guolo*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper examines theories behind the early optical/UV flares in tidal disruption events (TDEs) using calorimetric tests, finding that models involving accretion disk reprocessing or Keplerian disk formation explain the black hole mass scaling best, while shock-based or fallback rate models are ruled out.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve uncertainties about the origin of early optical/UV emissions in TDEs by testing theoretical predictions against observed mass scaling using calorimetric methods.

Method: Performed calorimetric tests comparing theoretical predictions of radiated energy and peak luminosity scaling with black hole mass against observed data. Evaluated models like Eddington-limited accretion disks, Keplerian disk formation, shock debris interactions, and fallback rate reprocessing.

Result: Models involving accretion disk reprocessing and Keplerian disk formation at the circularisation radius showed the best fit but require further refinement. Shock-based and fallback rate models were excluded at >5σ significance.

Conclusion: Current theories incompletely explain all observational data across black hole mass scales. Accretion and disk-related models are promising but need extension, while certain shock and fallback models are statistically invalid.

Abstract: Tidal disruption events are routinely discovered as bright optical/UV flares, the properties of which are now well categorized on the population level. The underlying physical processes that produce the evolution of their X-ray emission and their long-lasting UV/optical plateau are well understood; however, the origin of their early-time optical/UV emission remains the subject of much debate and uncertainty. In this paper we propose and perform ``Calorimetric'' tests of published theories of these optical flares, contrasting theoretical predictions for the scaling of the radiated energy and peak luminosity of these flares with black hole mass (something which is predicted by each theory), with the observed (positive) black hole mass scaling. No one theory provides a satisfactory description of observations at all black hole mass scales. Theories relating to the reprocessing of an Eddington-limited compact accretion disk, or emission (energy) released in the formation of a Keplerian disk near the circularisation radius, perform best, but require extending. Models whereby the optical/UV flare are directly produced by shocks between debris streams (e.g., TDEmass), or the efficient reprocessing of the fallback rate (e.g., MOSFIT, or any other model in which $L \propto \dot{M}_{\mathrm{fb}}$), are ruled out at high $(>5σ)$ significance by the data.

*Barbora Bezděková,Shahar Hadar,George Wong,Maciek Wielgus*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study explores using two-point image correlation functions to detect extreme gravitational lensing effects from black hole movies, showing that such correlations can reveal lensing signatures not visible in conventional observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of using two-point correlation functions as a probe for extreme gravitational lensing, which cannot be detected through traditional time-averaged images or light-curve autocorrelations.

Method: Ray tracing of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to generate black hole movies, followed by computation of two-point correlation functions under various resolutions, including those expected from next-gen interferometric arrays.

Result: Lensing signatures are not discernible in time-averaged images or light-curve autocorrelations but are clearly present in the two-point correlation functions at realistic resolutions.

Conclusion: The two-point correlation method effectively detects gravitational lensing, warranting further research into observational techniques and instrument specs to realize this approach.

Abstract: A black hole's gravitational pull can deflect light rays to an arbitrary degree. As a result, any source fluctuation near the black hole creates multiple lagged images on an observer's screen. For optically thin stochastic emission, these light echoes give rise to correlations of brightness fluctuations across time-dependent images (movies). The correlation pattern disentangles source-specific characteristics from universal features dictated by general relativity. This picture has motivated a proposal to use the two-point image correlation function as a probe of extreme gravitational lensing in upcoming black-hole imaging campaigns. In this work, we test the feasibility of this method by computing the two-point correlation function of brightness fluctuations in a black-hole movie of state-of-the-art realism. The movie is generated by ray tracing a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, which can then be blurred to any angular resolution. At an effective resolution expected to be achieved by next-generation terrestrial very-long-baseline interferometric arrays, the lensing signatures appear in neither time-averaged images nor light-curve autocorrelations. However, we demonstrate that they are clearly visible in the more fine-grained two-point image correlation function. Our positive findings motivate a more comprehensive investigation into the instrument specifications and inference techniques needed to resolve extreme lensing effects through correlations.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The analysis of NGC 3783's X-ray spectra using XRISM/Resolve reveals detailed features of the Fe Kα emission, indicating a neutral outer disk/torus, relativistic effects suggesting a spinning black hole, and constraints on the spin parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin of the Fe Kα emission line in NGC 3783, determine the nature of the emitting regions (e.g., disk, torus, BLR), and constrain the black hole spin and geometry using relativistic disk line modeling.

Method: Analysis of 439 ks XRISM/Resolve spectra, resolving Fe Kα into narrow/intermediate components, modeling asymmetric emission with relativistic disk line models for neutral/He/H-like iron ions, and fixing inner radius at ISCO to estimate spin limits.

Result: Detected Fe Kα components consistent with neutral gas in outer regions, relativistic effects implying black hole spin (a≥0.29 at 3σ), Compton shoulder, and marginal detection of Cr/Ni lines. Inclination dependent on ionization state (17-44°), inner radius near ISCO.

Conclusion: NGC 3783's Fe Kα profile provides evidence for a spinning black hole with constrained spin parameter, with emission regions linked to outer disk/torus and BLR. Further constraints require combined multi-wavelength analysis.

Abstract: Using XRISM/Resolve $439 \, \rm ks$ time-averaged spectra of the well-known Seyfert-1.5 active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC 3783, we investigate the nature of the Fe K$α$ emission line at 6.4 keV, the strongest and most common X-ray line observed in AGN. Even the narrow component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$α_{1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$α_{2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with a neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. The narrow and intermediate-width components have a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 350 $\pm$ 50 km/s and $3510 \pm 470 \, \rm km/s$, respectively, suggesting that they arise in the outer disk/torus and/or BLR. We detect a $10\%$ excess flux around 4 $-$ 7 keV that is not well described by a symmetric Gaussian line, but is consistent with a relativistically broadened emission line. In this paper, we take the simplest approach to model the asymmetric line as a single emission line (assuming either neutral, He-like or H-like iron) convolved with a relativistic disk line model. As expected, the inferred inclination angle is highly sensitive to the assumed ionization state, and ranges between $i=17-44^{ \circ}$. This model also constrains the black hole spin via the extent of the red wing: the required gravitational redshift in the fitted disk-line profile disfavors a non-spinning (Schwarzschild) black hole. The derived inner radius is close to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\rm ISCO}$ and strongly correlated with the black hole spin. To better constrain the spin, we fix the inner radius at $r_{\rm ISCO}$ and derive a lower limit on the spin of $a \ge 0.29$ at the 3 $σ$ confidence level. A Compton shoulder is detected in our data as well as a $2-3 \, σ$ detection of the Cr K$α$ and Ni K$α$ lines.

TL;DR: The analysis of SN 2022jli reveals 12.4-12.5 day periodic optical and gamma-ray emissions, suggesting a binary system with a compact object (neutron star or black hole), representing the first detected extragalactic high-energy binary system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the origin of periodic emissions in SN 2022jli and determine if they indicate a compact binary system formed post-supernova.

Method: Analysis of optical light curves, velocity shifts, and gamma-ray data over ~1.5 years to identify periodicity and correlate with binary system parameters.

Result: Confirmed 12.4-12.5 day periodicity in optical/velocity and gamma-ray emissions, consistent with a 12.5-day orbital period binary system containing a compact object.

Conclusion: SN 2022jli's remnant likely formed an extragalactic high-energy binary, providing insights into compact binary formation beyond the Milky Way.

Abstract: On May 5 2022, a type Ic supernova (SN) explosion SN~2022jli was discovered. This SN showed additional optical emissions, which were found to exhibit 12.4-day periodic undulations and concordant periodic velocity shifts. These key features likely indicate a compact object in a binary system was formed. A faint $γ$-ray source was also detected at the position of the SN and upon checking the $γ$-ray photons' arrival times, it was revealed that the same 12.4-day periodicity was likely present. Here we report our detailed analysis results for the $γ$-ray source. Not only was the $γ$-ray emission detectable for $\sim$1.5\,years since the discovery time, but a strong modulation at period 12.5\,day was also clearly determined. Considering the newly formed compact object to be a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole, the putative binary, having an orbital period of 12.5\,day, is likely the first extragalactic high-energy system detected. The system may serve as a valuable example for the formation of many such binaries observed in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Nsum algorithm to accurately measure nulling fractions in pulsars, addressing limitations in existing methods, particularly for weak pulsars or low-statistics data. It also explores quasi-periodicity in nulling behavior for several pulsars and compares results with previous studies using spin-down energy loss parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand pulsar nulling phenomena, especially in long-period pulsars where emission becomes undetectable, and to improve observational characterization that is hindered by low signal-to-noise ratios.

Method: Development of the Nsum algorithm, which uses sums of pulses to enhance signal detection from noise, and comparison with Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) using simulated and real data. Analysis of quasi-periodicity in nulling parameters for five pulsars.

Result: Nsum performs comparably to GMM on strong pulsars and outperforms it on weaker ones, yielding robust nulling fraction measurements. Quasi-periodic parameters were measured for the first time in some pulsars, revealing correlations with spin-down energy loss (Ė).

Conclusion: The Nsum algorithm provides a reliable method for nulling fraction measurements in challenging conditions, advancing the study of pulsar emission mechanisms and evolution. Quasi-periodic nulling behaviors correlate with Ė, offering new insights into pulsar physics.

Abstract: Radio emission from pulsars is known to exhibit a diverse range of emission phenomena, among which nulling, where the emission becomes temporarily undetectable, is an intriguing one. Observations suggest nulling is prevalent in many long-period pulsars and must be understood to obtain a more comprehensive picture of pulsar emission and its evolution. One of the limitations in observational characterisation of nulling is the limited signal-to-noise, making individual pulses often not easily distinguishable from noise or any putative faint emission. Although some of the approaches in the published literature attempt to address this, they lose efficacy when individual pulses appear indistinguishable from the noise, and as a result, can lead to less accurate measurements. Here we develop a new method (the $\mathbb{N}$sum algorithm) that uses sums of pulses for better distinguishability from noise and thus measures the nulling fraction more robustly. It can be employed for measuring nulling fractions in weaker pulsars and observations with a limited number of observed pulses. We compare our algorithm with the recently developed Gaussian Mixture Modelling approach, using both simulated and real data, and find that our approach yields consistent results for generic and weaker pulsars. We also explore quasi-periodicity in nulling and measure the related parameters for five pulsars, including PSRs~J1453$-$6413, J0950$+$0755 and J0026$-$1955, for which these are also the first such measurements. We compare and contrast our analysis of quasi-periodic nulling with previously published work and explore the use of spin-down energy loss ($\dot E$) to distinguish between different types of modulation behaviour.

Abstract: We present the discovery of PSR J1728-4608, a new redback spider pulsar identified in images from the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope. PSR J1728-4608 is a millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 2.86 ms, in a 5.05 hr orbit with a companion star. The pulsar exhibits a radio spectrum of the form $S_ν\propto ν^α$, with a measured spectral index of $α= -1.8(3)$. It is eclipsed for 42% of its orbit at 888 MHz, and multi--frequency image--domain observations show that the egress duration scales with frequency as a power law with index $n = -1.74$, where longer duration eclipses are seen at lower frequencies. An optical counterpart is detected in archival Gaia data within $0.5''$ of the radio position. It has a mean G-band magnitude of 18.8 mag and its light curve displays characteristics consistent with a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and irradiation effects. We also report the nearest Fermi $γ$-ray source, located 2$'$ away from our source, as a possible association. A radio timing study constrains the intrinsic and orbital properties of the system, revealing orbital period variations that we attribute to changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion star. At the eclipse boundary, we measure a maximum dispersion measure excess of $2.0 \pm 1.2 \ \mathrm{pc\ cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an electron column density of $5.9 \pm 3.6 \times10^{18} \ \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Modelling of the eclipse mechanism suggests that synchrotron absorption is the dominant cause of the eclipses observed at radio wavelengths. The discovery and characterisation of systems like \psr\ provide valuable insights into pulsar recycling, binary evolution, the nature of companion-driven eclipses, and the interplay between compact objects and their plasma environments.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The study shows that space-based gravitational wave detectors like TianQin can accurately detect dipole radiation from binary black holes even when they are in gaseous environments, as long as both environmental effects and dipole deviations are modeled together during Bayesian analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if environmental effects in gaseous environments (e.g., active galactic nucleus accretion disks) significantly impact the detectability of dipole radiation from stellar-mass binary black holes observed by space-borne gravitational wave detectors.

Method: Simulated gravitational wave signals incorporating both environmental effects and dipole deviation were analyzed using Bayesian inference to assess parameter recovery accuracy and distinguishability of dipole radiation.

Result: Even with strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter was recovered with high precision, and its evidence remained distinguishable. Environmental effects don't fundamentally hinder dipole radiation detection when both factors are modeled together.

Conclusion: Future space-based gravity tests using detectors like TianQin can remain robust for sources in astrophysical environments by simultaneously modeling environmental impacts and gravitational wave deviations.

Abstract: The space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin offers a new window to test General Relativity by observing the early inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes. A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments.

TL;DR: The first X-ray polarimetric observation of the blazar 1ES 1101--232 using IXPE reveals significant polarization degrees (17.9% to 38.9%) and a soft-to-hard spectral evolution, suggesting synchrotron emission in a structured magnetic field.

Motivation: To study the X-ray polarization properties of the extreme high-synchrotron-peaked blazar 1ES 1101--232, which can provide insights into the geometry and emission mechanisms of compact jets in blazars.

Method: Used IXPE for X-ray polarimetry along with simultaneous Swift-XRT and NuSTAR observations. Analyzed polarization degree, EVPA, spectral evolution, and hysteresis patterns in flux-photon index space.

Result: Detected significant X-ray polarization (2-6 keV) at 6.6σ (17.9% ±2.7%) and a higher degree at 4.3σ within a narrow interval. Observed soft-to-hard spectral evolution without flux variability and a clockwise hysteresis loop.

Conclusion: The X-ray emission likely originates from a region with a well-ordered magnetic field via synchrotron radiation, as indicated by polarization and spectral features.

Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarimetric observation of the extreme high-synchrotron-peaked blazar 1ES 1101--232, conducted by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The data analysis incorporates simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous observations from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. Our results reveal a significant detection of X-ray polarization in the 2--6 keV band at a confidence level (CL) of 6.6$σ$, with a polarization degree of $Π_{\rm X}=17.9\%\pm2.7\%$ and an electric vector position angle (EVPA) of $ψ_{\rm X}=10^\circ.0\pm4^\circ.4$. An even higher polarization degree of $Π_{\rm X}=38.9\%\pm9.1\%$ with an EVPA of $ψ_{\rm X}=13^\circ.9\pm6^\circ.7$ is observed within a narrower time interval, at a CL of 4.3$σ$. During the IXPE observational campaign, the X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1101--232 exhibits a clear soft-to-hard spectral evolution in the 0.3--10 keV band, although no significant flux variability is detected. Additionally, a clockwise hysteresis loop is identified in the flux--photon index plane. These findings collectively indicate that the X-ray emission from 1ES 1101--232 originates in a region characterized by a well-ordered magnetic field through synchrotron radiation.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the particle nature (Dirac vs. Majorana) of fermionic dark matter (DM) affects neutron star structure through modified equations of state, using relativistic mean-field models and comparing observational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unresolved nature of fermionic DM as Dirac or Majorana impacts dark matter phenomenology and detection strategies. Neutron stars provide a unique astrophysical environment to probe this property under extreme conditions.

Method: Extends relativistic mean-field frameworks with scalar/portal DM-nucleon interactions. Constructs equations of state for Dirac and Majorana DM cases, solves Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to model neutron star configurations, and compares against observational constraints (NICER, gravitational waves).

Result: Dirac DM (4 degrees of freedom) softens the equation of state more than Majorana DM (2 degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. Parameter spaces compatible with current observations are identified, showing observational potential to distinguish between DM types.

Conclusion: Compact star observations likeNICER and gravitational waves can potentially discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter by measuring neutron star M-R relations and tidal deformabilities.

Abstract: The fundamental character of a fermionic dark matter, whether it is a Dirac or Majorana particle remains a key unresolved issue whose answer would profoundly affect dark-sector phenomenology and detection strategies thereby motivates complementary probes across particle and astrophysical experiments. Compact stars, particularly neutron stars, offer unique astrophysical laboratories for probing such fundamental properties under extreme densities. The presence of a fermionic DM admixed with nuclear matter can modify the equation of state, thereby affecting observable quantities such as the mass-radius (M-R) relation and tidal deformability. In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. We identify the parameter space consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints, highlighting the potential of compact-star observations to discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between theoretical predictions of Galactic Dark Matter velocity distributions and the actual observed distributions in detectors by considering scattering effects.

Method: A double Monte Carlo scattering-by-scattering simulation was used to model 3D elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering, leading to the demonstration of a forward-backward asymmetry.

Result: Numerical results revealed an asymmetric 'forward-backward asymmetry' in the WIMP velocity distribution after scattering.

Conclusion: The effective velocity distribution and its asymmetry must be considered for accurate dark matter detection analysis, challenging traditional assumptions.

Abstract: In this talk, I discussed a 3-dimensional "effective" velocity distribution of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which, instead of the theoretically predicted velocity distribution of "entire" Galactic Dark Matter particles, describes the actual velocity distribution of WIMPs "scattering off" (specified) target nuclei in an underground detector. Based on numerical results carried out by our double Monte Carlo scattering-by-scattering simulation of 3-dimensional elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering, an (asymmetric) "forward-backward asymmetry" was also demonstrated.

Abstract: Jets provide an important channel for kinetic feedback from accreting black holes into their environment, without which models of the formation of large-scale structure in the universe fail to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies. Hence, an accurate measurement of jet power is critical for understanding black hole growth through accretion and also for quantifying the impact of kinetic feedback. However, the absence of instantaneous jet power measurements has precluded direct comparisons with the accretion luminosity, forcing kinetic feedback models to rely on ad hoc assumptions about how much jet power is released per accreted amount of mass. Here we report the detection of stellar wind-induced bending of the jets in the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, using 18 years of high-resolution radio imaging. By modeling jet-wind interactions, we determine the current kinetic instantaneous power of the jet to be log$_{10}(L_{\rm jet}/{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}) = 37.3_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$, comparable to the accretion energy determined from its bolometric X-ray luminosity. This result critically places prevailing assumptions about the energetics of black hole powered jets in both galaxy formation simulations, and in scaling models of black hole accretion, on a firm empirical footing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determine the accretion efficiency of the proposed IMBH in $ω$ Cen to understand its radio/X-ray signatures and confirm its existence.

Method: Conducted ultra-deep radio continuum observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (170 hours) achieving 1.1 $μ$Jy sensitivity at 7.25 GHz. Searched for radio emission at proposed cluster centers.

Result: No radio emission detected at any proposed cluster center. Derived a conservative 3-$σ$ upper limit on accretion efficiency of $εaselineskip 4×10^{-3}$.

Conclusion: Findings indicate exceptionally low accretion efficiency around the IMBH in $ω$ Cen, casting doubt on previous evidence and suggesting non-accreting status or alternative explanations for observed fast stars.

Abstract: For over a decade, both theoretical predictions and observational studies have suggested that $ω$ Centauri ($ω$ Cen), the most massive Milky Way globular cluster, might harbor an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Recently, identification of fast-moving stars in the core of $ω$ Cen provided the strongest evidence to date for the presence of such an IMBH. One of the key questions in the study of IMBHs is their accretion efficiency, which determines their radio and X-ray signatures. We investigate the accretion signature of the IMBH in $ω$ Cen with ultra-deep radio continuum observations of the central region of the cluster. Using approximately 170 hours of Australia Telescope Compact Array observations, we achieve a root mean square noise of 1.1 $μ$Jy at 7.25 GHz, making this the most sensitive radio image of the cluster to date. We detect no radio emission at any of the proposed centers of the cluster, imposing stringent constraints on the presence of an accreting IMBH in $ω$ Cen. Considering the fundamental plane of black hole activity, our findings indicate that the accretion efficiency around the black hole is exceptionally low (with a conservative 3-$σ$ upper limit of $ε\lesssim 4\times10^{-3}$).

### [44] [Massive Star Clusters as sources of high-energy gamma radiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09743)
*Luana N. Padilha,Rita C. Anjos*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how massive star clusters contribute to high-energy gamma-ray emission in the Galaxy, finding that young and compact clusters within 3 kpc of the Sun are significant sources of multi-TeV to PeV gamma rays through proton acceleration in supernova remnants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sources of high-energy gamma rays observed in the Galaxy, particularly focusing on the role of massive star clusters and their associated supernova remnants in accelerating protons that produce detectable gamma radiation.

Method: The study models proton injection and acceleration processes in two types of massive star clusters—dispersed and compact—using analytical methods to compute energy spectra and gamma-ray production rates. Clusters within a 3-kpc radius of the solar system are analyzed.

Result: Young and compact massive star clusters are found to contribute significantly to multi-TeV to PeV gamma-ray emission, with the majority of this emission originating from clusters near the solar neighborhood.

Conclusion: Nearby young compact massive star clusters are key contributors to high-energy gamma-ray observations in the Galaxy, highlighting their importance in astrophysical processes involving cosmic ray acceleration and propagation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the contribution of massive star clusters (MSC) as sources of high-energy gamma rays and their impact on the ultra-high-energy (UHE) emission observed throughout the Galaxy. By modeling proton injection, the study explores how the acceleration of protons in massive star clusters contributes to the gamma radiation detectable from Earth. The analysis focuses on two primary types of clusters: widespread, dispersed clusters and younger, compact massive clusters, both of which host shock waves generated by supernova remnants (SNR). Clusters located near the solar system, within a 3-kiloparsec radius,are identified. Analytical methods are used to calculate energy spectra and gamma-ray production rates. The findings suggest that young and compact MSC contribute to multi-TeV to PeV gamma-ray emission, with the dominant contribution arising from nearby populations.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We construct the metric-affine analogue of the quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We begin with a general metric-affine scalar-tensor action that is linear in curvature and contains all operators that are at most quadratic in the covariant second derivatives of the scalar field, ensuring that the connection enters only through curvature and through these second derivatives. Solving the connection equation by performing a full decomposition of the distortion tensor gives a closed-form effective metric theory. Imposing the standard metric DHOST degeneracy conditions then selects a Palatini Class Ia branch that is fully determined by two free functions in the original action. Analyzing the tensor sector shows that requiring gravitational waves to propagate at the speed of light further restricts the theory to a one-function family. These results provide a detailed and self-contained characterization of the quadratic metric-affine Class Ia sector within this operator basis and identify the theoretical conditions implied by gravitational wave observations.

### [46] [About possible measures in Quantum Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09191)
*O. P. Santillán*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores measures for quantum gravity, considering both diffeomorphism-invariant and non-invariant measures. Non-invariant measures might be viable if their anomalies are offset by counter-term redefinitions, with examples provided that could extend Veltmann identities to curved spacetimes, particularly in Stelle gravity which is renormalizable in flat but not curved spacetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate alternative measures for quantum gravity theories to handle renormalizability issues, especially in curved spacetimes, where existing models like Stelle gravity struggle.

Method: Analysis of diffeomorphism-invariant and non-invariant measures, including compensation via counter-term redefinitions. Uses specific non-covariant measure examples to generalize Veltmann identities for curved spacetime quantization.

Result: Demonstrates that non-invariant measures can be viable with appropriate counter-term adjustments, offering potential paths for renormalizing Stelle gravity in curved spacetimes.

Conclusion: Non-covariant measures, when properly adjusted, may resolve renormalization challenges in quantum gravity models like Stelle gravity when applied to curved spacetimes.

Abstract: Possible measures for Quantum Gravity are considered. Choices that are invariant under diffeomorphisms are analyzed, but the possibility of employing non invariant measures is also taken into account. The last possibility may be accepted if the anomaly in the measure is compensated by counter term redefinitions of the model under analysis. Particular attention is paid to some concrete examples of non covariant looking measures, which may be useful for generalizing the Veltmann identities when quantizing around curved space times. The results are specified for the Stelle gravity model [1]-[2], which is known to be renormalizable in flat space, although not known to be so in curved ones.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper investigates the formation and early mergers of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) and their gravitational-wave signatures detectable by LISA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the population and binary properties of DCBHs in the early universe, including mass, mass ratios, spins, and orbital eccentricities, which are critical for interpreting LISA data.

Method: Simulating the formation, collapse, and mergers of DCBH regions to extract gravitational-wave signals.

Result: Initial simulations are ongoing to determine how DCBH properties depend on formation details and surrounding baryonic/non-baryonic material.

Conclusion: Understanding DCBH dynamics and their gravitational-wave signatures is essential for analyzing LISA observations and requires further simulation-based research.

Abstract: Direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) are an important component of the massive black hole population of the early universe, and their formation and early mergers will be prominent in the data stream of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, the population and binary properties of these early black holes are poorly understood, with masses, mass ratios, spins, and orbital eccentricities strongly dependent on the details of their formation, and the properties of the remaining exterior material (baryonic and non-baryonic), which may be substantial to the point of merger.
  We report on initial work to simulate the formation, collapse, and/or merger of such DCBH regions in order to extract the resulting gravitational-wave signals.

### [48] [Massless Majorana spinors in the Kerr spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09253)
*Tianyuan Cai,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates nonexistence conditions for Majorana spinors in Kerr and Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes, establishes separation of variables for massless Majorana spinors with specific parameters, and shows scattering behavior in Schwarzschild spacetime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the existence and behavior of Majorana spinors in curved spacetimes, specifically addressing their dependency on parameters and spacetime structures, and understanding implications for spacetime properties and particle dynamics.

Method: The authors use separation of variables for the Dirac equation in non-extreme Kerr spacetime, analyze the role of constants ε₁ and ε₂, apply Hamiltonian formulations to study self-adjointness, and employ $L^p$ space analysis for nonexistence proofs.

Result: Massive Majorana spinors cannot exist in Kerr/Kerr-(A)dS with t/φ dependence. Massless versions allow explicit solutions only when at least one ε parameter is zero; nonexistence is proven for periodic spinors under certain L^p conditions. Hamiltonian self-adjointness forces spacetime to Schwarzschild with φ-independence. Finally, in Schwarzschild, massless spinors散射散射 (probabilistic dispersal over time).

Conclusion: The study establishes strict constraints on Majorana spinor existence in rotating black hole spacetimes and reveals scattering dynamics in static Schwarzschild geometry, highlighting fundamental links between spinor properties and spacetime parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that massive Majorana spinors \eqref{1.2} do not exist if they are $t$-dependent or $φ$-dependent in Kerr, or Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes. For massless Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime, the Dirac equation can be separated into radial and angular equations, parameterized by two complex constants $ε_1$, $ε_2$. If at least one of $ε_1$, $ε_2$ is zero, massless Majorana spinors can be solved explicitly. If $ε_1$, $ε_2$ are nonzero, we prove the nonexistence of massless time-periodic Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime which are $L^p$ outside the event horizon for $ 0<p\le\frac{6}{|ε_1|+|ε_2| +2}$. We then provide the Hamiltonian formulation for massless Majorana spinors and prove that the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian leads to the angular momentum $a=0$ and spacetime reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime, moreover, the massless Majorana spinor must be $φ$-independent. Finally, we show that, in the Schwarzschild spacetime, for initial data with $L^2$ decay at infinity, the probability of the massless Majorana spinors to be in any compact region of space tends to zero as time tends to infinity.

### [49] [Gravitational lensing in a warm plasma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09341)
*Barbora Bezděková,Volker Perlick*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of warm plasma on light bending near compact objects using general-relativistic spacetimes, extending beyond cold plasma assumptions to more accurately model high-temperature scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of cold plasma approximations in high-temperature environments near astrophysical objects like black holes or neutron stars.

Method: Derives equations for light rays in warm, non-magnetized electron-ion plasmas within general-relativistic frameworks, focusing on axially symmetric and stationary spacetimes. Computes bending angles and shadows in warm plasma conditions using Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetime models.

Result: Shows that plasma temperature significantly affects light deflection and shadow size compared to cold plasma models. Provides specific calculations for static/corotating and infalling plasmas around Schwarzschild/Kerr black holes.

Conclusion: Warm plasma effects cannot be neglected in certain high-temperature astrophysical scenarios; the study's framework enhances precision in modeling light propagation near compact objects.

Abstract: Analytical studies of light bending in a dispersive medium near compact objects, e.g., black holes or neutron stars, are most challenged by a suitable definition of the medium. The most realistic model would be a hot magnetized plasma. In such a medium, however, an analytical description of light rays is very difficult. Therefore, usually an isotropic dispersive medium is assumed in analytical calculations. While it is possible to formulate equations for a general refractive index, which some studies do, most attention in the literature is given to the particular case of a cold, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. Whereas this model covers many astrophysically relevant situations, there are indications that in some cases the plasma temperature is so high that the approximation of a cold plasma is no longer valid. For this reason, we consider in this paper a warm, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma, where the temperature is not set equal to zero but assumed to be small enough, such that relevant equations can be linearized with respect to it. After discussing the general equations for light rays in such a medium on a general-relativistic spacetime, we specify to the axially symmetric and stationary case which includes the spherically symmetric and static case. In particular, we calculate the influence of a warm plasma on the bending angle. In the spherically symmetric and static case, we also calculate the shadow in a warm plasma. We illustrate the general results with a static (respectively corotating) and an infalling warm plasma on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores a warm inflationary model within the braneworld framework, examining both constant and variable dissipation coefficients across strong and weak dissipative regimes. It analyzes the model's dynamics using slow-roll approximation and evaluates cosmological observables like the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, constrained by Planck 2018 and BICEP data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend warm inflation studies into braneworld scenarios and assess the model's viability by comparing predictions with observational data from Planck and BICEP.

Method: The model incorporates braneworld gravity with warm inflation, considering both constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Slow-roll parameters are derived, and cosmological observables are calculated. Parameter constraints are obtained using MCMC analysis with Planck 2018 and BICEP data.

Result: The model successfully reproduces observational constraints on spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, particularly in the weak dissipative regime with variable dissipation, aligning well with Planck data.

Conclusion: The braneworld warm inflation model with variable dissipation provides a viable framework consistent with latest observational constraints, offering insights into early universe dynamics beyond standard inflationary models.

Abstract: In the literature, many warm inflationary models are formulated. In this piece of work, a warm inflationary model in the braneworld scenario is studied, considering constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Performance of the model has been considered in both strong and weak dissipative regimes. We study the dynamics of this scenario under slow-roll approximation and estimate cosmological observables, viz., the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. In order to constrain the parameters in our model, we consider data from Planck 2018 and BICEP.

### [51] [Dual Effective Field Theory formulation of Metric--Affine and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09516)
*Ginés R. Pérez Teruel*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified algebraic and effective field theory (EFT) approach for non-Riemannian extensions of General Relativity, focusing on metric-affine f(R,Q) gravity and Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory. It derives exact solutions for the connection equations, expressing the Einstein-like equations as an effective Einstein equation with algebraic corrections from a T-tower of invariants. Convergence criteria and background matching for f(Q) gravity are also established.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified framework for non-Riemannian gravities with independent connections, addressing challenges in solving their equations of motion and connecting them to effective field theory descriptions.

Method: The authors use matrix solutions for connection equations in f(R,Q) gravity, algebraic solutions for EiBI theory's connection, and Neumann series expansions based on stress tensor invariants. They derive effective Einstein equations with algebraic corrections and establish convergence using the spectral radius of the stress-energy tensor matrix.

Result: Exact connection solutions, algebraic EFT corrections for EiBI and f(Q) theories, convergence criteria via spectral radius, and a unified language for metric-affine, Born-Infeld, and teleparallel gravities through their derived EFT coefficients.

Conclusion: The framework provides a convergent series expansion method for non-Riemannian gravities, enabling their description within an EFT paradigm. This unifies different theories under a common algebraic language, aiding in testing and comparing modified gravity scenarios.

Abstract: We develop a unified algebraic and effective field theory (EFT) formulation for non--Riemannian extensions of General Relativity with an independent connection. For metric--affine $f(R,Q)$ gravity we show that the connection equations admit an exact matrix solution, whose square--root structure generates a convergent binomial/Neumann expansion in powers of the stress tensor $T_{μν}$. For the Eddington--inspired Born--Infeld (EiBI) theory we show that the connection can be solved algebraically as well, and that its determinantal field equations produce a parallel Neumann expansion with coefficients fixed by the underlying determinant operator. This allows us to rewrite the Einstein--like equations in the auxiliary metric as an effective Einstein equation for $g_{μν}$ with a local algebraic correction $(ΔT)_{μν}$ that follows from a dual EFT built from the invariants $\{T,\,T^2,\,T_{μν}T^{μν},\ldots\}$, organised by a characteristic density scale. We prove a convergence criterion based on the spectral radius of $\hat T^μ_ν$ and interpret EiBI gravity as a determinantal resummation of the same $T$--tower. Extending the framework to symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, we identify the EFT coefficients in terms of $f_Q$ and $f_{QQ}$ and present a background matching for $f(Q)=Q+αQ^2$. The resulting dual EFT provides a common algebraic language for metric--affine, Born--Infeld and non--metricity gravities.

### [52] [Improving the inference of the stellar quantities using the extended $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09554)
*Eneko Aranguren,José A. Font,Nicolas Sanchis-Gual,Raül Vera*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of using non-observable mass M0 in I-Love-Q relations by comparing two approaches: assuming M0 equals the star's actual mass MS (suitable for slow rotation) and the improved I-Love-Q-δM method that infers M0 for broader applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the hindrance caused by using non-observable M0 in I-Love-Q relations, enabling more accurate astrophysical applications, especially for rapidly rotating neutron stars.

Method: The study reviews and numerically compares two methods: (1) the traditional approach approximating M0 as MS for slow rotation (χ_S < 0.1), and (2) the I-Love-Q-δM framework which calculates M0 without needing MS, allowing analysis beyond slow rotation.

Result: Numerical comparisons show the I-Love-Q-δM method provides accurate results for a wider range of rotation rates, whereas the traditional approach fails for rapid rotation.

Conclusion: The I-Love-Q-δM relations are superior for precise determination of inertia, Love number, and quadrupole moment across various neutron star spins, enhancing observational interpretations in relativistic astrophysics.

Abstract: In relativistic Astrophysics the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to approximately EoS-independent relations involving the moment of inertia, Love number, and quadrupole moment through some quantities that are normalised by the mass $M_0$ of the background configuration of the perturbative scheme. Since $M_0$ is not an observable quantity, this normalisation hinders the direct applicability of the relations. A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $χ_S<0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons.

### [53] [Relativistic accretion process onto rotating black holes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09845)
*Orhan Donmez,G. Mustafa,Himanshu Chaudhary,M. Yousaf,Abdelmalek Bouzenada,Allah Ditta,Farruh Atamurotov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates accretion dynamics and oscillations around charged rotating black holes using the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic model. Compared to the Kerr metric, the EEH model's charge (Q) and spin (a) parameters significantly alter gravitational fields, accretion rates, and quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs). Q enhances mass inflow near the horizon, intensifies shock instabilities, and suppresses turbulence farther out. QPO frequencies arise from precession and instabilities modified by Q and a, suggesting observable signatures testable via QPO and horizon-scale observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how nonlinear electrodynamics (EEH model) modifies accretion dynamics and QPOs around rotating black holes, providing observable tests distinct from the standard Kerr model. The study aims to identify parameter regions where EEH effects are maximally detectable.

Method: 1. Analyzed circular motion parameters (effective potential, epicyclic frequencies) in EEH geometry. 2. Modeled accretion using BHL mechanism, simulating shock-cone formation and instabilities. 3. Performed time-series analysis of accretion rates to detect QPOs. 4. Conducted parameter-space exploration for Q and a to map QPO activity peaks.

Result: Charge Q and spin a significantly shift orbital frequencies and alter accretion structures: - Q increases infalling mass near horizon, amplifies shock instabilities, and reduces turbulence at distance. - QPOs split into low-frequency (shock precession) and high-frequency (strong-field instabilities) components, dependent on Q and a.

Conclusion: Nonlinear electrodynamics (EEH model) leaves observable imprints on black hole accretion via modified QPOs and accretion dynamics, suggesting future observations (e.g., QPOs, horizon-scale images) could distinguish EEH effects from Kerr predictions, opening new tests for strong-field gravity and electrodynamics.

Abstract: In this study, we uncover the accretion dynamics and oscillatory behavior around rotating black holes within the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic framework by analyzing both the motion of test particles and numerically solving the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.

*Alex Stornelli,Anish Agashe*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines static charged fluid spheres with a cosmological constant, using a polytropic equation of state and power-law charge distribution. It analyzes the trapping of various particles' geodesics under different parameters, showing charged/massive particles' trapping depends on particle properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of charged fluid sphere structures in cosmological contexts and explore how different particle types (neutral/massive, charged/null) are trapped under varying geometric and physical conditions defined by parameters n (charge distribution) and Γ (polytropic index).

Method: The authors converted the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation into a mass profile differential equation, solved it numerically. They applied subluminal sound speed and energy conditions to ensure physical validity, then analyzed trapping regions in the n-Γ space for different particle types.

Result: Trapping of all particle types is possible across broad n and Γ ranges. Notably, only neutral null particles' trapping depends solely on spacetime properties, while others require considerations of charge/energy. Physical constraints reduced acceptable parameter configurations.

Conclusion: Charged fluid sphere configurations with cosmological constants exhibit diverse trapping behaviors depending on particle properties. The study highlights the critical role of particle characteristics (charge, energy) beyond spacetime geometry alone in determining geodesic trapping.

Abstract: We consider static charged fluid spheres with a cosmological constant. We assume a polytropic equation of state, $p \propto ρ^Γ$, and a power law charge distribution, $q\propto r^n$. Using this, we convert the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation into a differential equation for the mass profile. By solving this equation numerically, we analyse both physical and geometric properties of these charged fluid spheres for different values of $n$ and $Γ$. By imposing subluminal sound speeds and energy conditions, we restrict ourselves to configurations that are physically acceptable. Then, within these physical models, we study internal trapping of circular geodesics and find the trapping regions in the $n$-$Γ$ parameter space. Going beyond the traditionally studied case of null geodesics, we consider orbits of charged and/or massive particles. We show that for neutral null particles (and only for them), their trapping depends purely on the properties of the space-time. In the other three cases, properties such as the particle's own charge and/or energy also play a role. In general, we find that trapping of all types of particles is allowed for a broad range of $n$ and $Γ$.

### [55] [Light trajectories and optical appearances in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild and black string space-times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09869)
*G. Alencar,Arthur Lima,Diego Rubiera-Garcia,Diego Sáez-Chillón Gómez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how the space-time geometry of non-asymptotically flat objects, such as Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black holes and black strings, which approach Anti-de Sitter space-time, affect the light trajectories and resulting images, offering a distinct observable fingerprint compared to standard Kerr black holes. This has implications for future VLBI observations to test alternative black hole models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The EHT images of M87 and Milky Way's centers support the black hole paradigm, but alternative models require scrutiny. The paper aims to explore how space-time properties and accretion disk physics contribute to observable fingerprints, using Anti-de Sitter backgrounds to challenge the asymptotically flat assumption.

Method: The study models light trajectories around Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black holes and black strings, simulating their optical appearance under Anti-de Sitter space-time conditions. Comparative analysis is performed with standard asymptotically flat black holes to highlight deviations.

Result: Anti-de Sitter space-time leads to measurable distortions in light paths and resulting images, differing significantly from Kerr black holes. The Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter and black string cases demonstrate unique features in shadow size, shape, and emission profiles, providing testable predictions for VLBI.

Conclusion: The Anti-de Sitter assumption alters observables in ways detectable by future VLBI, enabling tests of alternative black hole models. Observations of such fingerprints could either validate or constrain modified gravity theories predicting non-asymptotically flat geometries.

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaging of the central objects in the M87 and Milky Way galaxies provide compelling evidence that these objects are consistent with (Kerr) black holes. In view of these observations and the future expectations of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) on which the EHT observations are based, an intensive research work has been carried out in the literature to simulating light trajectories and reconstructing the corresponding optical appearance for a wide array of modified black holes and ultra-compact objects. The corresponding images are directly affected not only by the background space-time geometry but also by the physics of the accretion disk, whose combination yields a characteristic fingerprint. In this paper, we consider such a fingerprint for objects which are not asymptotically flat but instead approach a Anti-de Sitter space-time. This assumption significantly influences light trajectories and, consequently, the corresponding images of the objects as seen by an observer at some distance, which can be used in future VLBI observations for testing alternatives of this kind to the Kerr paradigm. We illustrate our considerations with the examples of a Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a black string, discussing their most notable departures from canonical, asymptotically-flat black hole space-times.
