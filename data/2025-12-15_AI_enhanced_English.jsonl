These gradients, which we refer to as axion hair, couple to the local background magnetic field, inducing a large voltage drop near the surface of the star; here, we demonstrate that the presence of axion hair decouples local near-field particle acceleration in the open magnetic field line bundle from the rotational frequency of the pulsar itself. This is significant as the non-observation of old slowly-rotating pulsars is attributed to the fact the rotationally-induced electric fields are not strong enough to sustain $e^\\pm$ pair production. In this work, we review the evidence for the existence for `pulsar death', i.e. the threshold at which $e^\\pm$ pair production (and thus, by association, coherent radio emission) ceases, and demonstrate using both semi-analytics and particle-in-cell simulations that the existence of axion hair can dramatically extend pulsar lifetimes. We show that the non-observation of extremely old, slowly rotating, pulsars allows for a new probe of light QCD and CP-violating axions. We also demonstrate how the observation of emission from both poles of pulsars with nearly orthogonal rotational and magnetic axes, as seen e.g. in PSR J1906+0746, can be used to set competitive limits on CP-violating axion-nucleon interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The impact of nuclear burning and atomic opacity is poorly understood and often treated with simplified prescriptions. We systematically investigate different treatments of nuclear heating, thermalization, and opacities in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of BNSM ejecta and kilonova light curves. Ejecta from long-term numerical-relativity simulations are evolved to ~30 days using a 2D ray-by-ray approach. We compare simplified heating-rates, thermalization prescriptions, and gray opacities with in-situ nuclear networks (NN) that track energy deposition, and include a composition-dependent thermalization scheme and frequency-dependent, atomic-physics-based opacities. Coupling NN and hydrodynamics affects nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. Assuming homologous expansion alters the abundance evolution and produces a narrower second $r$-process peak and a third peak shifted to higher mass numbers. Nuclear heating back-reaction delays and reddens the early emission. A constant thermalization underestimates the early luminosity and overestimates the late emission. Analytical opacities yield dimmer and redder kilonovae at early times ($t\\lesssim$ hour) and a prolonged emission at $t\\gtrsim5$ days. Resolving the first hundreds of milliseconds of hydrodynamics is essential for robust nucleosynthesis calculations, and composition-dependent thermalization and frequency-dependent, atomic opacities are needed to accurately capture the ejecta temperature and kilonova brightness and color evolution. Analytic nuclear-power fits with simplified thermalization and opacities can reproduce the density and temperature evolution of the ejecta.

A softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry plays a crucial role in realizing this scenario, under which the Standard Model (SM) fermions are even, while new vector-like fermions present in the model are odd. A notable feature of this model is that the PS gauge boson $X_\u03bc$ itself is $Z_2$-odd, causing it to couple exclusively between SM fermions and the vector-like fermions, except in the right-handed down-quark sector, where mixing is induced by the soft breaking of $Z_2$. This structure leads to helicity suppression of tree-level meson decays mediated by $X_\u03bc$, with helicity-unsuppressed contributions arising only via one-loop diagrams. We show that $X_\u03bc$ can be as light as 1.1 TeV while being compatible with all flavor-violating constraints.

This comparatively low PS-breaking scale opens up promising collider opportunities for probing the leptoquark gauge boson, as well as the distinctive signature of vector-like down-type quarks carrying an unusual baryon number of $2/3$.

In this extended HEFT, depending on the $SU(2)$ nature of the new scalar in the UV, operators will be suppressed by different powers of a heavy mass scale. We use dimensional analysis to systematically evaluate expected hierarchies between Wilson coefficients, leading to structural relations between potential LHC observables, such as di-boson resonances, tau pair production or the di-photon channel. Once future collider data reveals a hint of a new scalar field, it can be fitted to this extended HEFT and such a structural analysis will help interpret it with respect to possible UV models, circumventing the need to individually test each possible model on the data or to fix the $SU(2)$ representation of the new scalar beforehand. For illustration, the framework is applied to the tentative 95 GeV resonance. In addition to its usefulness for collider physics, the extended HEFT can also be beneficial for low-energy observables, allowing to describe new scalars in an agnostic way.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes an extended Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) with non-linearly realized electroweak symmetry to analyze collider signals from new scalars, enabling model-agnostic interpretation of data and linking observations to UV models without prior assumptions.", "motivation": "To address the potential discovery of light new scalars at colliders within extended scalar sectors, avoiding model-specific biases and systematically connecting collider data to underlying UV theories.", "method": "Using an extended HEFT framework with operators suppressed by heavy mass scales based on the UV scalar's SU(2) properties. Dimensional analysis establishes hierarchies between Wilson coefficients, which are then mapped to observables like di-boson resonances.", "result": "The framework successfully relates LHC observables through structural relationships, demonstrated with a 95 GeV resonance example. It provides a systematic approach for interpreting collider hints model-independently.", "conclusion": "The extended HEFT offers a versatile tool for both collider and low-energy physics, enabling agnostic exploration of new scalars and reducing the need for exhaustive model-by-model analysis."}}
