We don't understand its quantum origin but we associate it with the actual acceleration of the universe because it is the simplest description we had until recently of the present cosmological observations. However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $Λ$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $Λ$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski."}

Lorentz violation modifies the oscillation and damping rates in a unified manner across all perturbative sectors: the real part of the QNM frequency increases monotonically with the Lorentz-violating parameter $\\ell$, while the imaginary part becomes more negative.

We find that the X-ray spectra are predominantly thermal and can be described by low-absorbed blackbody models with effective temperatures ranging from 50 to 210 eV. In two sources, the spectra also show narrow absorption features at $300 - 400$ eV. Additional non-thermal emission components are not detected in any of the five candidates. The soft X-ray emission, the absence of optical counterparts in four sources, and the consequent large X-ray-to-optical flux ratios $>3000 - 5400$ confirm their INS nature. For the remaining source, eRASSU J144516.0-374428, the available data do not allow a confident exclusion of an active galactic nucleus nature. However, if the source is Galactic, the small inferred X-ray emitting region is reminiscent of a heated pulsar polar cap, possibly pointing to a binary pulsar nature. X-ray timing searches do not detect significant modulations in all candidates, implying pulsed fraction upper limits of 13 - 19% ($0.001-13.5$ Hz). The absence of pulsations in the FAST observations targeting eRASSU J081952.1-131930 and eRASSU J084046.2-115222 excludes periodic magnetospheric emission at 1 - 1.5 GHz with an $8σ$ significance down to 4.08 $μ$Jy and 2.72 $μ$Jy, respectively. The long-term X-ray emission of all sources does not imply significant variability. Additional observations are warranted to establish exact neutron star types. At the same time, the confirmation of the predominantly thermal neutron star nature in four additional sources highlights the power of SRG/eROSITA to complement the Galactic INS population."}

Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointed close to our line of sight, offer a unique view into jet dynamics. Blazar $γ$-ray light curves exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flares that point to promising alternative dissipation mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection. This study uses three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations with the PLUTO code to explore magnetic reconnection in turbulent, magnetized plasma columns. Focusing on current-driven kink instabilities, we identify the formation of current sheets due to magnetic reconnection, leading to plasmoid formation. We develop a novel technique combining hierarchical structure analysis and reconnection diagnostics to identify reconnecting current sheets. A statistical analysis of their geometry and orientation reveals a smaller subset that aligns closely with the jet axis, consistent with the jet-in-jet model. These structures can generate relativistically moving plasmoids with significant Doppler boosting, offering a plausible mechanism for the fast flares superimposed on slowly varying blazar light curves. These findings provide new insights into the plasma dynamics of relativistic jets and strengthen the case for magnetic reconnection as a key mechanism in blazar $γ$-ray variability."}

However, existing gravitational wave-based tests have so far assumed non-eccentric signal sources, limiting their applicability to more general astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we present pTEOBResumS, a new parametrized inspiral-merger-ringdown model for null tests of GR that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession. Building on the effective-one-body model TEOBResumS-Dalí, we introduce parametrized deviations from GR both in the inspiral and the merger-ringdown regimes. We validate the model via parameter estimation of synthetic signals, including from numerical relativity simulations of BBHs and a boson star binary. These allow us to establish the model's consistency, demonstrate its capability to identify beyond-GR effects, and gauge the impact of eccentricity in tests of GR. We then analyze a set of BBH events from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs, testing whether they are best explained by a GR or non-GR waveform, under either the eccentric, spin-aligned or precessing, quasi-circular hypotheses. We find no significant statistical evidence in favor of deviations from GR. Consistent with previous works, we infer a mild preference for longer remnant quasi-normal mode damping times than expected in GR, though the limited sample and potential systematics reduce its significance. In addition, when weighting by signal strength, joint posteriors combining the individual events are still compatible with GR. We find no strong evidence for imprints of orbital eccentricity in the analyzed events, with the exception of GW200129. For this, our analysis finds a strong preference for an eccentric, GR-consistent description, although as previous works have noted this result could be influenced by data quality issues."}

Their increasing precision raises the possibility of detecting new physics, especially in a neutron star binary system that may contain hidden-sector particles.

In this work, we critically examine the mechanisms for neutron stars to acquire enough hidden-sector particles with requisite couplings to furnish a detectable signature from dark electromagnetism. We demonstrate that the repulsive nature of vector forces imposes stringent constraints on any putative particle physics model or astrophysical environment which could give rise to such gravitational signatures. We argue that absent an extreme fine-tuning of parameters, such signatures are well out of reach of any current or near-future gravitational wave observatory."}

Compared to traditional methods (parametric Moffat, ePSF template-based, and regularized likelihood), we demonstrate that our PSF models achieve orders of magnitude higher likelihood and residuals consistent with noise, all while remaining visually realistic. Further, the method applies even for faint and heavily masked point sources, merely producing a broader posterior. By recovering a realistic, pixel-level posterior distribution, our technique enables the first meaningful propagation of detailed PSF morphological uncertainty in downstream analysis.

Our goal was to manufacture the mid-infrared IOBC for NOTT based on the double-Bracewell architecture and run a detailed laboratory characterization in the L' band. We focus on the achievable raw and self-calibrated nulling ratios. We use a double Michelson interferometer to produce four broadband coherent beams simulating the four telescopes of the VLTI and perform broadband nulling at room temperature. We analyze the modal, chromatic, and polarization behavior of the IOBC, and measure its total throughput. We were able to manufacture a single-mode four-telescope double-Bracewell IOBC in GLS mid-infrared transparent glass using Ultrafast Laser Inscription. We show that the directional couplers forming the four-telescope IOBC (4T-nuller) have an achromatic splitting ratio across the band 3.65-3.85 um with a 40/60 and 50/50 splitting for the side couplers and the central coupler, respectively.

Here we report observational evidence that the radio jet and the very high-energy (VHE) and ultra high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray emission could be aligned along a common axis, indicating a co-spatial or co-directional origin.

Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case.

When a photon counting device observes a bright source, we face an unavoidable problem called pile-up. Pile-up leads to mistakes in the observational properties of the source, mainly an apparent decrease in the X-ray flux. X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) has two X-ray telescopes, one of which is Xtend, a CCD camera with a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 38 arcmin square. Xtend has three operating modes: full window mode with a frame exposure of ~4 s, 1/8 window mode with ~0.5s and reduced FOV, and 1/8 window mode with burst option, whose frame exposure is reduced to ~0.06 s. Observers need to select the operating mode according to their target fluxes. We develop the pile-up simulator for Xtend to provide a quantitative assessment of pile-up according to the fluxes, spectra, and shapes of X-ray sources. We derived the 10% pile-up limits for a point source of 7.8, 66.2, and 447.9 counts/s for full window, 1/8 window, and 1/8 window mode with burst option, respectively, by assuming the Crab spectrum.

In this context, equation-of-state-insensitive or ``quasi-universal'' relations between key observables, such as the compactness, dimensionless static tidal deformability, and moment of inertia, play a crucial role in connecting different measurable observables while minimizing uncertainties due to the yet unknown equation of state. In this work, we identify new quasi-universal relations between the static, dimensionless tidal deformability ($Λ^{(0)}$) and its leading-order dynamical correction ($Λ^{(2)}$), as well as a combination of these parameters ($\\sqrt{Λ^{(0)}/Λ^{(2)}} \\equiv Mω_*$), obtained from the small-frequency expansion of the relativistic tidal response. We test these relations across a representative set of 63 equations of state, finding that the equation-of-state dependence does not exceed $\\sim 5\\%$ for the $Λ^{(0)}$-$Λ^{(2)}$ relation and $\\sim 2.5\\%$ for the $Λ^{(0)}$-$Mω_*$ relation. This indicates a high degree of universality and offers a simplified framework for incorporating dynamical tidal effects into gravitational-wave modeling. Furthermore, we compare the fully dynamical tidal response against different recent strategies (a Taylor expansion and an effective-one-mode approximation) to model the dynamical tide. We find that both models are capable of capturing the frequency-dependent behavior of the fully dynamical tidal deformability, with the Taylor expansion outperforming the effective-one-mode approximation in most of the parameter space."}

In this work, we present targeted radio observations of 31 such candidates using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the Shanghai TianMa Radio Telescope. Over a total of 46.65 hours of observing time, we detected neither periodic nor single-pulse radio emissions. These nondetections place stringent upper limits on the flux densities of any potential radio signals, reaching ~4 $μ$Jy for periodic emission and ~10 mJy for single pulses with FAST. Since our observations are highly sensitive and the flux density upper limits are well below the median fluxes of known Galactic pulsars, this suggests that geometric beaming is the most likely explanation for the non-detections if these objects are indeed pulsars. Alternatively, the NSs may be sufficiently old ($\\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr) and have become intrinsically radio-quiet. In this case, our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of confirming NSs in such old detached binary systems through radio pulsation searches."}

Persistent microseisms in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band couple into the instruments, degrade lock stability, and contribute substantially to detector downtime during observing runs. The multi-stage seismic isolation system has achieved remarkable success in mitigating such disturbances through active feedback control, yet residual platform motion remains a key factor limiting low-frequency sensitivity and duty cycle. Further reduction of this residual motion is therefore critical for improving the long-term stability and overall astrophysical reach of the observatories.\n  In this work, we develop a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to model and suppress residual seismic motion within the isolation system. Ground and platform sensor data from the detectors are used to train a neural network that predicts platform motion driven by microseismic activity. When incorporated into the control scheme, the network's predictions yield up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in residual motion compared to conventional linear filtering methods, revealing that nonlinear couplings play a significant role in limiting current isolation performance. These results demonstrate that machine-learning-based control can provide a powerful new pathway for enhancing active seismic isolation, improving lock robustness, and extending the low-frequency observational capabilities of gravitational-wave detectors."}

At first sight, this might appear of little practical use, as non-relativistic scattering through pseudo-scalar interactions is momentum-suppressed and spin-dependent, resulting in scattering rates below any experimental sensitivity. We show that the scattering rate can be drastically enhanced in two ways. First, light ALPs with masses below the typical momentum transfer at direct detection experiments lift the momentum suppression by acting as essentially massless mediators. Second, ALP exchange through loops induces coherent spin-independent scattering. If the ALP has flavor-changing couplings to up-type quarks, loop-induced scattering receives an extra strong enhancement by the top-quark mass. We deduce that, contrary to common lore, XENONnT and PandaX-4T are already sensitive to ALP-mediated dark matter-nucleon scattering. The next generation of direct detection experiments will probe far into the parameter space of the ALP effective theory, potentially exceeding the sensitivity of collider searches."}

This frequency range was selected because VLF radio waves are efficiently reflected by the lower ionospheric layers, and any changes in these layers lead to corresponding variations in the received signal. We have used a magnetic loop antenna for signal reception along with a low noise amplifier, analog-to-digital converter, and spectrum analyzer. Data was collected over the course of a few days, from a remote location with minimal electromagnetic interference.

Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($α> -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > β> -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $Γ\\sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\\%$-$20\\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $δ\\sim 1.8$.

Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold. Taken together, our results show that optically thin IC scattering offers a physically consistent and observationally viable explanation for the prompt emission in a subset of bright GRBs, motivating the application of IC models in future GRB studies."}

At such temperatures, the irreducible ultraviolet (UV) freeze in production of DM through graviton exchange becomes important and must be combined with the infrared (IR) freeze in yield mediated by the dark photon. As long as gravitationally produced DM does not equilibrate through annihilation into dark photons and the subsequent formation of a dark thermal bath, it retains information about the reheating phase. Including this gravitational contribution relaxes the required DM and SM portal coupling and allows smaller values than those that would match the observed relic abundance through IR freeze in alone. Since current direct detection experiments have excluded the benchmark freeze in model over a wide range of DM masses, they are now effectively probing high reheating temperatures and the gravitational freeze in of DM."}

It is important to account for the complete stellar population captured within a radio telescope's field of view, or stellar 'bycatch'. In recent years, catalogues from ESA's Gaia mission have enabled SETI surveys to place tighter limits on extraterrestrial transmitter statistics. However, Gaia remains restricted by magnitude limits, astrometric uncertainty at large distances, and confusion in crowded regions. To address these limitations, we investigate the use of the Besançon Galactic Model to simulate the statistical underlying stellar population to derive more realistic constraints on the occurrence of extraterrestrial transmitters. We apply this method to Breakthrough Listen's Enriquez/Price survey, modelling 6,182,364 stellar objects within 1229 individual pointings and extending the search out to distances $\\leq 25$kpc. We place limits on the prevalence of high duty cycle transmitters within 2.5kpc, suggesting $\\leq (0.000995 \\pm 0.000002)\\%$ of stellar systems contain such a transmitter (for near-zero drift rates and EIRP$_{\\mathrm{min}} \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{16}$W). In support of broader adoption, we provide a simple calculator tool that enables other researchers to incorporate this approach into their own SETI analyses. Our results enable a more complete statistical estimation of the number and stellar type of systems probed, thereby strengthening constraints on technosignature prevalence and guiding the analysis of future SETI efforts. We also conclude that SETI surveys are, in fact, much less biased by anthropocentric assumptions than is often suggested."}

Our analysis quantifies the coverage probability for all model parameters, such has the magnetic field strength and the electron luminosity, and reveals that different blazar subclasses exhibit distinct sensitivities to spectral gaps. For LSPs, a minimal dataset comprising optical/UV, X-ray, and GeV $γ$-ray bands is sufficient for robust parameter inference. In contrast, ISPs and HSPs require broader spectral coverage to constrain the physical parameters. For ISP, we find that reliable parameter recovery can be achieved with two different minimal band combinations: \\textit{(i)} X-ray, high energy $γ$-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray data, or \\textit{(ii)} optical/UV, X-ray, and high energy $γ$-ray data.

Using the Einstein's field equations in metric $f(R)$ gravity we model solutions for both wormhole as well as $f(R)$ gravity. We obtain four different wormhole models, two wormholes are characterised by solid angle deficit, three are not asymptotically extendible, while one is asymptotically flat with zero tidal force. These are supported by four different power law $f(R)$ models. The parameter space of the models can support both null energy conditions (NEC) satisfying as well as violating wormhole. In case of NEC satisfying matter, the associated $f(R)$ is ghost. The $f(R)$ models obtained have been independently substantiated for cosmological feasibility and valid parameter space was obtained corresponding to cosmologically viable $f(R)$. Suitable scalar-tensor representation of the corresponding $f(R)$ models have been presented using the correspondence of $f(R)$ gravity with Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity. The robustness of the wormhole solutions were further analysed with the BD scalar fields in the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which showed excellent results. Lastly as an independent astrophysical probe for the wormhole we have obtained the location of their photon spheres and have connected them with the Herrera Complexity factor in $f(R).$ Our results show that the relation between the complexity factor and existence of photon spheres remains fundamentally unaltered in $f(R)$ as compared to Einstein's gravity."}

Persistent microseisms in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band couple into the instruments, degrade lock stability, and contribute substantially to detector downtime during observing runs. The multi-stage seismic isolation system has achieved remarkable success in mitigating such disturbances through active feedback control, yet residual platform motion remains a key factor limiting low-frequency sensitivity and duty cycle. Further reduction of this residual motion is therefore critical for improving the long-term stability and overall astrophysical reach of the observatories.\n  In this work, we develop a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to model and suppress residual seismic motion within the isolation system. Ground and platform sensor data from the detectors are used to train a neural network that predicts platform motion driven by microseismic activity. When incorporated into the control scheme, the network's predictions yield up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in residual motion compared to conventional linear filtering methods, revealing that nonlinear couplings play a significant role in limiting current isolation performance.

Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to the ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform."}

The ringdown of BBH merger, consisting of a series of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), is of particular interest for both the black hole (BH) spectroscopy and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency check. Unlike the QNM frequencies that only depend on the properties of the remnant BH, the excitation amplitudes and phases of QNMs depend on the progenitor system, and calculating them is beyond the perturbative approach. In this paper, by performing self-consistent fully non-linear simulations of BBH merger in shift-symmetric scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity as well as in sGB gravity allowing for scalarization, and extracting the QNM excitation, we explore the possible deviations from GR at the ringdown stage. We numerically verify that the mode frequencies are consistent with the theory prediction, and provide the fitting results of mode amplitudes and phases. We find relatively small changes in the mode excitation, considering that the largest coupling we used in the simulations is close to the limit of loss of hyperbolicity. To demonstrate that our results are robust against the eccentricity caused by the imperfect initial data, we also perform eccentricity reduction and estimate the effect caused by the initial eccentricity. These studies are useful for understanding the ringdown in sGB gravity."}

If black holes form and evaporate within the cooling timescale of the neutron star, periodic episodes of black hole evaporation could impart a steady-state stellar luminosity, providing a source of heat additional to the kinetic energy of dark matter during capture.

We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $δ_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $δ_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements.

Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case.

However, it is not easy to confirm their exotic nature from global observables such as masses, spins, parities, and decay widths. At high energies, internal quark and gluon configurations could become more apparent because hadrons should be described by fundamental degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics. One of such possibilities is to use the fragmentation functions (FFs). In this work, accurate FFs of an exotic hadron candidate $f_0$(980) are determined for the first time by an global analysis of experimental data on $e^+ + e^- \\to f_0 (980)+X$ with recent precise measurements of the Belle collaboration. From the global analysis, we found that their second moments have a relation $M_u = M_d \\ll M_s \\sim M_g $ for up-quark, down-quark, strange-quark, and gluon FFs. Furthermore, the function $D_s^{f_0}(z)$ is distributed in the larger-$z$ region in comparison with the functions $D_{u}^{f_0}(z)$, $D_{d}^{f_0}(z)$, and $D_g^{f_0}(z)$. These facts support that the $f_0 (980)$ has the $s\\bar s$ configuration at high energies. This is a new finding that $f_0 (980)$ should be considered mainly as the $s\\bar s$ state, which is different from our usual understanding as a tetraquark (or $K\\bar K$) hadron from low-energy studies. Our results could indicate the transition of the internal configuration picture that $f_0 (980)$ looks like a $q\\bar q$ state at high energies although it is described by tetra-quark or $K\\bar K$ molecule state at low energies.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We present a minimal secluded dark-matter (DM) framework based on an extra $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. The model contains a Dirac DM particle $χ$, three heavy neutrinos $N_I$ with masses $M_{N,I}$, and a singlet scalar $R$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs doublet $Φ$ by an angle $α$. A symmetry forbids the $Φ$-$R$ portal at tree level; the leading portal then arises at one loop from the same Yukawa structures that generate active neutrino masses $m_{ν,I}$, implying $\\tan(2α) \\propto \\sum_I m_{ν,I} M^2_{N,I}/(v_h m_H^2)$, where $v_h$ and $m_H$ are the SM Higgs VEV and mass. For heavy-neutrino masses in the multi-TeV range, this yields a naturally tiny mixing, $\\tan(2α)\\sim 5\\times 10^{-11}\\left(M_N/10~\\mathrm{TeV}\\right)^2$, which strongly suppresses DM signals in direct, indirect, and collider searches. For PeV-scale heavy neutrinos the DM-nucleon cross section can instead enter the reach of direct-detection experiments. The visible and dark sectors thermalize at temperatures of order a few times the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino, then subsequently decouple, and typically evolve with a slightly hotter dark bath. In the secluded regime, with $\\tan(2α)\\ll 1$ and $m_χ>m_{H_p}$, the relic density is set by $p$-wave annihilation $χ\\barχ\\to H_p H_p$ (with $H_p$ the Higgs-like particle of the dark sector), and the dark-sector Yukawa couplings required to reproduce the observed abundance are $\\sim(0.1\\text{-}1)$, as in the standard WIMP case. For heavy-neutrino masses $\\gtrsim 10~\\mathrm{TeV}$, the mediator decays before nucleosynthesis without spoiling BBN observables, while the tiny portal suppresses present-day signals below current and near-future sensitivities. This links two long-standing puzzles, the absence of DM signals and the smallness of neutrino masses, within a predictive thermal framework."}

We did this in the context of a model of the LISA-detectable binaries in the MW from the population synthesis code SeBa.\n  Results: We find that for five of the GCs in our sample, binaries in the GC could be easily distinguished from MW disc binaries using the sky location alone; for another five, binaries in the GCs could be distinguished using a combination of LISA's sky location and distance measurements; and for the final ten, binaries in the GCs could not be distinguished from overlapping MW disc binaries. The results depend strongly on the sky locations of the GCs, with GCs far away from the Galactic plane being easy to resolve, while GCs close to the Galactic centre overlap with many MW disc binaries. The most promising GC for finding a WD binary that could be resolved to that GC, based on sky location and GC mass, is 47 Tucanae."}

Other events, such as GW170817 and GRB 250702B, provide conditions that may favor the formation of strangelets. Strangelets are stable clusters of SQM, potentially created during the phase transition between the 2SC and CFL color-superconducting states. These clusters could generate monochromatic $γ$-ray lines in very-high-energy spectra through self-annihilation. This work analyzes the stability of strangelets, production cross-sections, and mass-to-charge ratios using QCD-based models. Data from H.E.S.S., Fermi-LAT, MAGIC-II, and CTA were used to set limits on spectral features and possible fluxes. Detecting narrow $γ$-ray lines will require improved instrument sensitivity. By integrating evidence from multimessenger astrophysics and dense QCD simulations, this study investigates the equations of state for compact stars and explores the potential cosmological influence of SQM."}

Previous studies have not considered the influence of the magnetic field within the Crab Nebula. The magnetic field plays a crucial role through the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) process, in which high-energy electrons produce synchrotron radiation that is subsequently up-scattered by the same electrons via inverse Compton scattering to generate gamma rays. Therefore, neglecting the magnetic field in modeling leads to theoretical inconsistencies. In this work, we investigate the significance of the magnetic field effect and demonstrate that even differences in magnetic field modeling can substantially alter the conversion probability.

This fact led us to implement extra conditions on the combination $\\left(ρ+p\\right)$ and, consequently, obtain a consistent background cosmological analysis. In the vacuum case, we obtain an analogy between the Kasner solutions and the equations in $\\mathrm{NUG}$. We also propose a new analysis of a non-homogeneous equation of state, the combination $\\left(ρ+p\\right)=l$. We identify that the cosmological dynamics are strictly dependent on the value of the constant $l$. The physically interesting case is at the value $l<0$, which seems to indicate a super-accelerated, ghost-like universe. This case still requires a more detailed analysis, for example, from a thermodynamic point of view, keeping in mind that $\\left(ρ+p\\right)$ may be interpreted as enthalpy of the system.

These solutions terminate at a critical point, with their charge-to-mass ratio approaching unity from below, and the instability timescale diverging. Beyond the critical point, we find a new region of parameter space where the threshold solution is an extremal black hole. We measure the scaling of the dynamical time period of the near threshold solutions and discuss how they are connected in the two regimes. If a similar picture to the one found here holds for known families of stationary solutions of rotating matter that approach the exterior of an extremal Kerr spacetime, they could provide a route to forming an extremal spinning black hole."}

Ejection of CEs leads to tightened stellar orbits capable of forming compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. As these mergers are seen by gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK), we ask what the merger rates of compact binaries in LVK tell us about the fraction of LRNe that lead to the formation of compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Using the observed volumetric rates of LRNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and of compact binary mergers from LVK observations, we derive limits on the fraction of LRNe that produce compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Assuming the LRNe rate closely follows the star formation rate at any redshift, we use the delay time distribution models for compact binaries to compute the compact binary merger rate. A comparison of this merger rate with the latest volumetric rates of compact binary mergers from the fourth GW transient catalog (GWTC-4) at the present epoch of LVK allows us to constrain the above fraction. We find that only a fraction as small as $\\sim 10^{-3}$ (median) of the LRNe correspond to the GW-observed binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This potentially implies that the majority of the LRNe population will not lead to mergers of compact objects, but other end products, such as stellar mergers."}

In this work, we critically examine the mechanisms for neutron stars to acquire enough hidden-sector particles with requisite couplings to furnish a detectable signature from dark electromagnetism. We demonstrate that the repulsive nature of vector forces imposes stringent constraints on any putative particle physics model or astrophysical environment which could give rise to such gravitational signatures.
