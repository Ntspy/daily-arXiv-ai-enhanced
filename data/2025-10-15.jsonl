The massless scalar field is quantized in\nthe Boulware vacuum to isolate curvature-modulated acceleration effects without\na thermal Hawking background. Working in a (1+1) radial reduction and using\nfirst-order time-dependent perturbation, we evaluate the period-averaged\ntransition rate (or the \"Floquet\" transition rate). The resulting particle\nemission spectrum exhibits a thermal Bose-Einstein-type profile with periodic\ntrajectory yielding a Floquet resonance condition $n\\Omega > \\omega_0$ and a\nclosed-form expression for the Floquet transition rate $\\overline{P}_n$ which\nreduces to the flat Minkowski spacetime result as $R_0\\to\\infty$. Near the\nhorizon, $f(R_0)<1$ enhances the effective Bessel argument by\n$1/\\sqrt{f(R_0)}$, providing a simple analytic demonstration of\ncurvature/redshift amplification of acceleration radiation. In particular, the\nspectrum weighted by Bessel function becomes ill-defined near the black hole\nhorizon as $R_{0}\\rightarrow 2M$, possibly manifesting the well-known\npathological behavior of Boulware vacuum state. We discuss the regime of\nvalidity (small amplitude, $R_0$ away from the horizon) and outline the\nextensions to (3+1) dimensions, including density-of-states and greybody\nfactors, and to alternative vacuum choices. Our results offer an analytically\ntractable link between flat-space \"vibrating atom\" proposals and black-hole\nspacetimes."}

We show\nhow a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must\nrespect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein\nequation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant\nmust be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing\nfields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra\ndimension.

We identify five objects in our sample that show broad Mg II\nabsorption features consistent with the presence of CSM.

We do not find any correlations between the shell properties and the\nSN properties, except for a marginal correlation between the light curve\ndecline time scale and the shell velocities. We further demonstrate that CSM\nconfigurations similar to the majority of the detected shells would have been\nobservable in spectra with signal-to-noise >8 per resolution element, and that\nthe lines from a shell are in general detectable except in the cases where the\nshell is either very geometrically and/or optically thin.

While\nthese fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small\nscales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave\nbackground observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the\ninflationary Hubble scale, $m\\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is\nflat. Meanwhile, if $m\\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted\nisocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but\navoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a\ncoincidence of scales $m\\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we\nshow that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary\ndynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted\nspectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically,\nif its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition\n$V''<3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the\nboundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to\n$H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of\n$e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived,\nthis mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which\nis insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar.

A blue-tilted\nisocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but\navoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a\ncoincidence of scales $m\\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we\nshow that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary\ndynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted\nspectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically,\nif its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition\n$V''<3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the\nboundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to\n$H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of\n$e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing.

However, the confirmed detection\nof such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources\nof contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties.\nRobust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise\ncontamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the\nastrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of\nunlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR)\ndepending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed\nastrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have\nperformed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated\npopulation of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\\sim$ 0.01\\% of\nthe event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs\nof $\\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter\nspace of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over\nwhich the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW\npair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique\nwill be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW\ndetectors, which can observe many more GW sources."}

Yet in the study of\nHawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often\nintroduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is\ngenerically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We\nrevisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four\nrepresentative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and\nD'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case\n$\\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation.\nWe compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter\ncan be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A\ncrucial role is played by the sign of the term $\\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in\nSchwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal\ncoupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the\nD'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\\xi$, the low-energy emission\nspectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\\xi fR<0$\nthroughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the\ntransmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the\ncase where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the\nnon-minimal coupling on their evaporation history."}

Here\nwe propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first\nconsider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and\nphotons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data\nfrom the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of\ngravity of $M_f \\gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could\nraise this bound to $M_f \\gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of\npairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated\ncosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This\nconsideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental\nscales of $M_f \\gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal\nneutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced\nin cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that\nexpected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would\nproduce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky\nwhere no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton\npropagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe."}
