Performing a global fit, we find that the Standard Model (SM) yields only a very poor agreement with the data, both in the exact U-spin limit as well as when substantial U-spin breaking is allowed for. The tension is primarily driven by the unexpectedly small longitudinal polarisation fraction in almost all $ΔS = 1$ decays, especially for $B_s \\to K^{*0} \\overline{K^{*0}}$, for which the individual disagreement with U-spin based expectation is about $3.5σ$. Within the SM framework, the only effective resolution would be to disregard entirely the hierarchy between the longitudinal and transverse helicity amplitudes, in the heavy quark limit, as dictated by naive factorisation. An alternative would be to invoke new physics (NP) in the $b\\to s$ sector that does not respect the hierarchy, and hence can reduce the tension for all the $ΔS=1$ modes. We demonstrate that certain colour suppressed NP operators can alleviate the tension significantly without adversely affecting the agreement for the other modes."}

We address these uncertainties for all operators of the non-relativistic effective field theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions, making use of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information divergence to measure the deviation of the true dark matter velocity distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form. This approach quantifies how astrophysical uncertainties affect each operator in the effective theory, without assuming any specific functional form for the velocity distribution. While for some operators the uncertainties are smaller than one order of magnitude for entropically-motivated deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, for other operators these uncertainties can be as large as three orders of magnitude near threshold. Furthermore, we identify the dependence of the scattering rate for various operators of the effective theory with different velocity-weighted moments of the velocity distribution, functionally analogous to the mean, variance, or skewness. This provides new analytic insight into which features of the velocity distribution are most relevant to detect a given particle dark matter model. Our technique is general and could be applied to a broader class of physics problems where a physical observable depends on the statistical moments of an uncertain theoretical distribution."}

Over the past two decades, our understanding of these outflows has expanded significantly, with their associated phenomenology now observed across the X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared regimes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of both low- and high-ionisation winds, treating each separately as well as part of a broader phenomenon, and place these findings in the context of current theoretical modelling. We discuss their close connection with disc atmospheres, their impact on the accretion process, and their role within the broader framework that includes the radio jet and the different accretion flow configurations and states. We also address current challenges and outline some of the anticipated developments, particularly those linked to upcoming observational facilities."}

We precisely calculate entropy, internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, accounting for perturbative thermal corrections. Our results reveal that the internal energy of small black holes diverges asymptotically due to these fluctuations. The corrected Gibbs free energy attains asymptotically high values for small horizon radii. In contrast, the equilibrium Gibbs free energy approaches zero. Additionally, we assess the stability of the black hole in the presence of these thermal fluctuations. We find that, in contrast to the equilibrium state, the thermal fluctuation introduces a double phase transition to the stability of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the influence of fluctuations is notably significant, primarily for small black holes. These findings offer new insights into the thermodynamic properties of topological black holes in the presence of thermal fluctuations."}

NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during growth.We also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models."}

While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine."}

To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars.

In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate."}

The timelike circular geodesics around LQRNBH and the influence of the model parameters on the circular motion are also discussed.

Axions are a leading candidate to be dark matter; however, a search of the full range of all likely axion masses is hampered by the standard quantum noise limit. This makes haloscope searches for axions with masses above 0.1 meV unfeasible with current technologies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new photon counting technique designed to operate at 30-60 GHz for detecting axions with masses between 0.124 meV and 0.248 meV, based on a single electron in a Penning trap. The electron cyclotron mode absorbs microwave photons, and, via the continuous Stern-Gerlach effect, this absorption imparts a measurable phase shift onto the axial motion. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze this photon detection method. We introduce a new type of fast, phase-sensitive axial detection technique, using axial-magnetron parametric amplification to overcome detector Johnson noise and cancel associated frequency shifts. This method may find other applications in precision Penning trap frequency measurements. We compare the efficiency of the electron single-photon counter with an ideal device, and find that our proposed photon counter has sufficient performance to search for high mass axions."}

Assuming azimuthally symmetric noise properties is a common simplifying assumption for such simulations, which neglects the patchy nature of the residual diffracted starlight; i.e., speckles. Fortunately, patchiness might prove to be an opportunity that improves the overall sensitivity of observatory assuming photon-noise limited speckle subtraction. We illustrate this effect in the context of angular differential imaging (ADI), which is one of the possible observing strategies being considered for the detection and characterization of exo-Earth with HWO. We show that combining observations of two observatory roll angles leads to a gain in signal-to-noise greater than $\\sqrt{2}$ when the patchy starlight dominates other noise sources. The gain can be closer to x2 when the starlight dominates the noise budget by more than an order of magnitude. In other words, combining good and bad observations is better than combining two average ones. This statement is very general as it is a direct consequence of combining data with a weighted mean. It applies more broadly to any combination of observations with varying noise level."}

Recent observations have linked a few tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the production of high-energy neutrino emission, all of which display dust-reprocessed infrared flares, indicating a dust- and gas-rich environment. By cross-matching the neutrino events and a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies with transient radio flares, we uncover an optically obscured TDE candidate, SDSS J151345.75 $+$ 311125.2, which shows both spatial and temporal coincidence with the sub-PeV neutrino event IC170514B. Using a standard equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral evolution spanning 605 days post mid-infrared discovery, we find a little evolution in the radio-emitting region, with a kinetic energy up to $10^{51}$ erg, depending on the outflow geometry and shock acceleration efficiency assumed. High-resolution European VLBI Network imaging reveals a compact radio emission that is unresolved at a scale of $<$ 2.1 pc, with a brightness temperature of $T_b>5\\times10^6$ K, suggesting that the observed late-time radio emission might originate from the interaction between a decelerating outflow and a dense circumnuclear medium. If the association is genuine, the neutrino production is possibly related to the acceleration of protons through pp collisions during the outflow expanding process, implying that the outflow-cloud interaction could provide a physical site with a high-density environment for producing the sub-PeV neutrinos.

A modified power law is assumed for energy distributions, incorporating terms such as energy loss/decay, which are effective at low energies, and a source term, which is dominant at high energies. The parametrizations of the momentum distribution of primary protons and helium have been obtained including energy loss term. For muons, both the energy loss and decay terms have been included. It is shown analytically that zenith angle distributions is given by $\\cos^{n-1}θ$ in terms of energy index $n$ and the presence of decay term does not affect it.

By extending the Einstein-Hilbert action to include quadratic curvature terms as $\\mathcal{L}\\propto R-λC^2+μR^2$, the theory introduces two massive modes: a scalar mode and a ghost tensor mode. Using the post-Newtonian expansion method, we derive the explicit expressions for the metric for a general source up to 1.5PN order. Furthermore, for a point-mass source, we extend the solution to 2PN order and evaluate the effective Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameters $γ(r)$ and $β(r)$. The results show that deviations from General Relativity are exponentially suppressed. The theory has the feature $γ(r)\\equiv 1$ when $m_R=m_W$, and to ensure that gravity remains attractive, we have $m_W>m_R/4$.

The energy correlator measures the energy flow as a function of the angular distance ($χ$) from the identified $J/ψ$ meson. Using the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator, the correlator is computed at both parton and hadron levels. At high $J/ψ$ transverse momentum ($p_T > 7\\ \\text{GeV}/c$), the parton-level correlator in the $\\cosχ> 0$ region is dominated by soft gluon emission during the hadronization of the color-octet state, a contribution clearly distinguishable from other partonic sources, such as underlying multi-parton interactions. The transition to the hadron level, however, introduces substantial modifications, suppressing the correlator in this region by approximately an order of magnitude and underscoring the complexity of the hadronization mapping. Further analysis reveals that the hadron-level observable exhibits notable sensitivity to model parameters: increasing the mass splitting between colored $c\\bar{c}$ pre-resonances and the $J/ψ$ meson from 0.2 to 0.8 GeV/$c^{2}$ enhances the correlator by up to $60\\%$, while extending the color reconnection range yields a milder enhancement of about $10\\%$.

Although the analysis does not require an explicit reconstruction of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$), the discrimination power still arises from the sensitivity of the radio observables to the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower (EAS). Such radio-based approaches could be particularly relevant for radio-only experiments, such as GRAND. To assess this feasibility, we obtained conservative upper limits for the discrimination accuracy using a supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely a random forest (RF). The input features used were the peak electric fields and the spectral slopes, which have complementary discrimination power, along with the antenna distances to the shower axis. The RF was trained and tested using large event sets generated by the fast radio emission simulation and simplified detector response implemented in the RDSim framework. We obtained discrimination accuracies between 81\\% and 96\\% over the studied zenith range, even after normalizing each shower by its own electromagnetic energy. Since the analysis includes deliberately conservative choices, such as a large 10\\% uncertainty on the reconstructed EM energy, these quoted values should be interpreted as conservative upper limits suitable for a feasibility assessment.

We develop a framework for regulated topology change based on smooth Lorentzian spin cobordisms with interpolating metrics, allowing a transient failure of global hyperbolicity while preserving smoothness, Lorentz signature, and spin compatibility. Within this framework we introduce the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic, a curvature-based functional that weights topology-changing geometries by conformal curvature, spin admissibility, and topological complexity. The diagnostic functional is built from Weyl curvature invariants and includes a parity-odd dual Weyl term that is sensitive to geometric chirality. Spin consistency is enforced via a Stiefel-Whitney constraint, ensuring that only physically admissible cobordisms contribute. As an example, we construct a smooth spin cobordism between a Morris-Thorne wormhole and asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime. In the throat region the curvature response is shown to be Weyl-dominated, and the parity-odd Weyl contribution sharply distinguishes chiral knotted embeddings while vanishing for amphichiral configurations. We then show that braids provide a natural language of throat dynamics: evolving wormhole throats trace time-dependent braid movies, with elementary braid generators representing the fundamental topological operations of the cobordism. Replacing crossing number by a braid-based complexity refines the diagnostic functional to operate at the level of these elementary exchanges and extends it naturally to multithroat and networked configurations."}

We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\\,{\\rm g}\\lesssim M \\lesssim 10^{16}\\,{\\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation."}
