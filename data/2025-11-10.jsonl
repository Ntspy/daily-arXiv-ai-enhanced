Previous studies have interpreted the mergers with primary mass\n$\\gtrsim45\\,M_\\odot$ as being dominated by hierarchical, second-generation\nmergers, with rapidly spinning primaries being the products of previous black\nhole mergers assembled in dense stellar clusters. In this work, we reveal\nconfident evidence of another subpopulation with rapid and isotropic spins at\nlow mass containing the two exceptional events GW241011 and GW241110,\nconsistent with a hierarchical merger hypothesis. Our result suggests the mass\ndistribution of the second-generation black holes is peaked at low primary\nmasses of $\\sim16\\,M_\\odot$ rather than $\\gtrsim45\\,M_\\odot$ in the\npair-instability gap. Such low-mass second-generation black holes must be\nformed from the merger of even lighter first-generation black holes, implying\nthat dense, metal-rich stellar environments contribute to the binary black hole\npopulation. By separating the contamination of higher-generation black holes,\nour result reveals the primary mass distribution of first-generation black\nholes formed from stellar collapse, which shows a significant dip between\n$\\sim12\\,M_\\odot$ to $\\sim20\\,M_\\odot$. This may indicate a dearth of black\nholes due to variation in the core compactness of the progenitor."}

We study the production rate of\nsuch particles inside the polar gap of nearby pulsars. After production they\nare accelerated above MeV energies by the local electric fields. These\npulsar-produced millicharged particles can be detected at Earth in\nlow-threshold dark matter direct detection experiments. We find that the\ncurrent XENONnT data constrains millicharged particles produced in the Crab\npulsar to have charges less than $O(10^{-6})$ for sub-eV masses."}
