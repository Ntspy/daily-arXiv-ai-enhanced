Utilizing $\u03bd\u03c0^0$ and $\u03bde^+e^-$ final states from HNL decays, we find that the Drell-Yan mechanism provides important contributions and significantly enhances the HNL search sensitivity, owing to the production of energetic final-state particles that are more readily detectable over the expected backgrounds.

They feed power into the unstable wave, and subsequently return to their initial state, draining power back out. This new flavor pendulum captures the dynamics of weak, nearly monochromatic fast flavor instabilities.

We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a ``hard'' spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism.
