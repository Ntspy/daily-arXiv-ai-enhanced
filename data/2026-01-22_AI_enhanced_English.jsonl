However, thermal conduction can be strongly enhanced when materials of significantly different temperature are brought into proximity, and thus into close thermal contact. Jets of active galactic nuclei may act as heat pumps by bringing low-entropy gas from the cluster core into thermal contact with the hot outer atmosphere of the cluster, significantly increasing the feedback efficiency of active galactic nuclei. We test this hypothesis by running a suite of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of active galactic nuclei jets in a Perseus-like cluster, including anisotropic conduction. We find that the heat pump efficiency $\u03b7$ can reach up to 50\\% of the maximum possible efficiency $\u03b7_{\\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $\u03b7\\approx f_{\\rm sp}\u03b7_{\\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways.

A set of questions of broad scientific interest relating to SMBH demographics and SMBH-galaxy correlations could in principal be answered by using TDE emission as an efficient means to constrain SMBH masses. In this paper we argue for using well-understood elements of TDE emission (the thermal X-ray continuum and late-time UV plateau) to derive empirical relationships between the more poorly understood early optical/UV flare and the black hole mass, before using these empirical relationships to measure TDE black hole masses simply and rapidly. We provide a publicly available code TDEFLARE which does this, showing (i) it produces results consistent with disk codes containing far more physics, (ii) it reproduces galactic scaling relationships at high ($>5\u03c3$) significance, (iii) it produces reliable mass estimates for both partial and full disruptions, and (iv) it does not require late time data to derive mass constraints.

The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material.

Building on previous PHSD benchmarks against dilepton data, we extract upper limits on $\\varepsilon^2(m_U,m_\u03c7,\u03b1_\u03c7)$ in both the visible regime ($m_U<2m_\u03c7$), where $U\\!\\to e^+e^-$ dominates, and the invisible regime ($m_U>2m_\u03c7$), where $U\\!\\to\u03c7\\bar\u03c7$ is kinematically open. Cosmological and astrophysical constraints are incorporated in two complementary ways. First, we compute the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section $\u03c3/m_\u03c7$ for Yukawa-mediated SIDM and confront it with bounds from dwarf galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters. Second, we determine thermal relic target curves by computing the relic abundance and requiring $\u03a9_{\\rm DM}h^2\\simeq 0.12$, consistent with \\textit{Planck} measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Combining PHSD limits on $\\varepsilon^2$ with relic density and self-interaction requirements, we exclude regions of the $(m_\u03c7,m_U)$ plane for each DM realization (Dirac, Majorana, or complex scalar) and identify benchmark scenarios in which heavy-ion, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints are simultaneously satisfied.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates a dark sector interacting with the Standard Model via a kinetically mixed dark photon, analyzing its production and decay processes using the PHSD transport approach to set constraints on model parameters based on collider data, cosmological considerations, and astrophysical observations.", "motivation": "To explore the viability of dark photon-mediated dark matter scenarios by combining high-energy collision data from PHSD with cosmological relic density requirements and astrophysical self-interaction constraints, addressing gaps in understanding dark sector interactions.", "method": "Extends PHSD transport framework to include dark photon production/decay channels, derives upper limits on kinetic mixing parameter \u03b5\u00b2 considering visible/invisible regimes, calculates self-interaction cross-sections for SIDM and thermal relic abundance, integrating collider, cosmological, and astrophysical constraints.", "result": "Exclusion regions identified in the (m\u03c7,mU) parameter space for different DM types (Dirac, Majorana, scalar), with benchmark models proposed that satisfy all constraints simultaneously by balancing PHSD limits, Planck relic density, and SIDM bounds.", "conclusion": "Dark photon models with specific mass couplings and DM realizations can be constrained by combining terrestrial collider data with cosmological-astrophysical limits, offering a coherent framework to narrow down viable dark sector parameter spaces."}}

In this work, we systematically analyze the $\\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$\u03c3$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $\u03b3$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $\u03b3$-ray emitting HBLs.

This review develops a unified framework that connects these two domains. It is based mostly on multiple studies by the authors in the past few years. Using the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) to capture essential nonperturbative features of the QCD vacuum, we derive effective interactions for mesons, baryons, and multiquark states, construct their wave functions in hyperspherical coordinates, and boost them to the light front. The resulting light-front Hamiltonians, incorporating both perturbative and instanton-induced dynamics in the Wilsonian spirit, provide realistic nonperturbative inputs for computing PDFs, DAs, GPDs, quasi-distributions, and gravitational form factors at a well-defined low scale. The connection to perturbative QCD is then established by matching gradient-flow-renormalized operators and LF wave functions to the standard $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme. Perturbative DGLAP and ERBL evolution then connects these predictions to experimentally accessible regimes. % This approach is applied to quarkonia, glueballs, light mesons, baryons, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and higher multiquark hadrons, yielding consistent descriptions of both their spectra and partonic structure.
